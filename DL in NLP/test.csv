0,PetSafe Staywell Pet Door with Clear Hard Flap,1/1,4.0,We've only had it installed about 2 weeks. So far it works great. My chubby collie & old black lab are both going in and out easily. It was easy to install. It was hanging up a little when closing but seems to be working through that. It was supposed to be a clear door & it is not. Very disappointed in that.
1,"Kaytee Timothy Cubes, 1-Pound",0/0,1.0,My bunny had a hard time eating this because the hay was so dry and it was too small for her to chew on.
2,Body Back Buddy,0/0,5.0,would never in a million years have guessed that this little thing was capable of so much. whoever invented it is a goddamn genius. It's fantastic...especially if you get knotted up easily in your back - this thing will make you cry.
3,SnackMasters California Style Turkey Jerky,0/0,5.0,"Being the jerky fanatic I am, snackmasters hands down is the best brand on the market! Must try! I buy mine from whole foods and I first tried this brand when I was staying at Marriott hotel, I have been hooked since."
4,Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy,1/1,4.0,"Wondered how quick my dog would catch on to this. She's pretty smart! She's playing with this a lot and knows that even though she can smell the treats better at one end, they only come out on the other. Luckily, it does take a while to get all the treats out. You'll need tiny treats for this. I got the Busy Buddie buddy berries (or something like that!)."
5,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,"My boxer likes these, but he doesn't get really excited about them. But if they work as advertised and clean his teeth, then they are great."
6,Orvus W A Paste,0/0,5.0,Use this to wash our show cows. It is great. A little goes along way so it lasts. Seems to be gentle and not cause any rashes of any kind. No smell really maybe like ivory soap.
7,Be Good My Little Sandbox Play Sets (Pirates Ahoy!),0/1,2.0,this thing was no larger than a kchen plate and i know i should have looked at the size closer but for a 2 year old parts are choke hazards. Plus for a 2 year old cleaning upblue sand off the carpet all day really sucks.
8,HUGO For Women By HUGO BOSS Eau de Toilette,0/0,5.0,"I love Hugo boss. It's perfect for everyday, it's great smelling without being over strong. Most things give me headaches, but this one is just great!"
9,Nailtiques After Artificial Treatment,0/0,5.0,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE PRICE. MY NAILS WERE IN ROUGH SHAPE AND WITH THIS PRODUCT I FEEL THEY ARE SRONGER THAN EVER.
10,Remington SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen & Cutter Blade Head,0/1,1.0,This item does not fit my model razor even tho the packaging says it does. Not even close!!! Manufacturer needs to check this out.
11,One-A-Day Womens Active Metabolism Multivitamin - 165 Tablets,1/1,1.0,I was very excited to take this vitamin hoping it would give me a boost of energy. I took the vitamin after eating and within 5 minutes I threw it all up!! An hour later and I still feel sick and very weak. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. This is the first and last day I will be taking thirst vitamins. Huge wast of money.
12,Star Wars EIII Revenge of the Sith 12 Inch Action Figure General Grievous,1/1,1.0,Came broken and Eck's Shack would not replace it and doesn't answer my e-mails. This was a gift for my ten year old grandson who loves Star Wars. I wish I could say he loves it but we sent it back to show them we weren't lying and they never refunded the money. They basically called me a liar and left it at that.
13,Royal Hawaiian Pikake Cologne Mist 1.6 oz (Note NEW Size 1.6oz / 47ml),0/0,3.0,The perfume was nicely packaged and there was gift of a pen which was really nice. The fragrane is strong and lasts for a whole day. It is reasonably priced and shipping was also affordable.
14,OliveNation Culinary Lavender,1/1,5.0,8 oz. is a big package. Smells great. Baking up a bunch of lavender white chocolate scones for the freezer. Tastes wonderful!
15,"Pink by Victoria's Secret Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 2.5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Greetings from the Devil's Summertime Resort, Phoenix, AZ, where today it will reach a balmy 116% with 45% humidity. Ah yes, it's swell. What's even more fun is trying to find a fragrance that won't ""sour"" or get so strong it has everyone in line at Starbucks gagging and holding their nose (yeah, that happens). Pink! Perfume is light and lovely and NEVER sours and for whatever reason, does not react the way other perfumes can and often do, in the extreme heat. There are a lot of gorgeous fragrances out there, but Pink! is the absolute PERFECT daytime fragrance, especially in the summer!"
16,Klorane Soothing Eye Make-up Remover,0/0,5.0,"it works perfectly, it does not sting, and, it removes eye make up quickly. I have used it for years"
17,"Zuke's Z-Filets High Protein Dog Treats, 3.25 Ounce Bag",0/1,2.0,"There were exactly 8 treats in the bag I bought...that's almost $1 per treat! Sure, my dog loved them, but that's way too much to pay for dog treats. I expected the package to contain more."
18,"Osteo Bi-Flex Advanced Triple Strengh, 80 coated caplets",2/2,4.0,"I've used this product for awhile and feel it makes a real difference for me. I can tell when I haven't been taking it. But the price can be a little high, and this deal from Amazon is the best I've found pricewise. I also like having a large enough supply on hand to last 2-3 months. The only drawback is the size of the pills, but that's the same for all of these joint meds."
19,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap,0/0,5.0,My dog is disabled and this wrap is a Godsend. Without it I wouldn't be able to keep my dogs diapers in place. This product has made a near impossible situation workable.
20,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I was looking for a toy my dog would love and would entertain her both while we were home and playing with her AND while we weren't home.SHE ADORES this toy!!! My dog is an Australian Shepherd, 8 years old and loves her toys!!First, I love that it has the 'hunting' element to it. She will stick her entire nose/face into the holes to get the last squirrel/chipmunk!! It's so cute.When I put all three in she will grab it and shake it violently (as in going in for the kill) and they fling out one at a time!!! Hilarious to watch.Then, I LOVE that the each squeak!!! And so does my dog. She will pounce on them and chew it to hear it squeak!!This has quickly become one of her FAVORITE TOYS, and believe me, she has quite a lot of them. When we tell her to get 'Chippy' (we think they look more like chipmunks) she runs over to the toy and pounces!!!Then, when she is more calm or tired, she will cuddle with them as well.I bought this for her last Christmas (2011) and she plays with it constantly and ROUGH and it is still in GREAT condition!!!Granted, she doesn't chew things apart, so I don't know if your dog is prone to chewing toys apart how that would play out.But I can't believe it looks as good as it does after months and months of playing!!I am SO happy I bought this toy -- as it is more ""interactive"" than most and she loves it!!! I don't regret buying it for one second.When it eventually wears out, I will most definitely be buying another!!!"
21,PediFix Wart STICK,1/1,5.0,"I was a little skeptical about using this product, thinking that it just wouldn't work, but after a week or so of of using it religiously, soaking my wart, applying the product, and covering it with a bandage twice daily for a week, my wart is gone! Wish I would have done it a long time ago!!"
22,Ecco Bella Flowercolor Natural Mascara Black 0.38 oz,0/0,3.0,"I just wish I would have read a little more reviews before I bought it. I searched for ""organic mascara"" and this came up. The ingredients contain methylparaben and polyparaben. So I'll use it for a month then I'll toss it and do a more thorough search next time."
23,Silk Spirits Conditioner 8oz bottle by Chris Christensen,1/1,5.0,"This is a mircale product!! Leaves the coat smooth as silk!! lolNo more knots, and not sure if it is bc of this or the other Chris Christensen products, but the dog's coat stays cleaner longer and he does not need a bath as pften as he used to. He goes outside frequently, so he does get dirty and dusty. Just a regular brushing (shih tzu mix) and his fur stays amazingly clean and tangle-free!!! Love this product!! It lasts forever too!! 5*!! :)))"
24,Ty Beanie Babies Flip the Cat,0/0,5.0,I still have my original Flip the Cat in mint condition. I really love Flip because Flip reminds me of one of my kitties who is all white. Flip is very solidly constructed and very well made. Her fur is very white with pink whiskers and pink button nose.She is one of the early Beanie Babies and a true treasure!
25,Clairol Natural Instincts,0/0,5.0,My wife has used this product for some time now but has had trouble finding it in stores. It was great to find it online.
26,Solvit 62313 Waterproof Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/1,1.0,"Bench seat cover was advertised to fit all vehicles - could be adjusted to fit. It does NOT fit a 2000 Buick Lesabre - not large enough!! Returning item for partial refund because my ""window"" for return has already closed (?)"
27,Lindberg-Snider Red Baron Barbecue Spice 14oz.,0/0,5.0,This seasoning is the absolute best for many meats but especially for barbecued chicken. Can't even imagine rotissering chicken without it. KFC eat your heart out!!
28,Fisher-Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile,0/0,5.0,"My son LOVES this mobile. He'll lay in his crib and coo at this mobile for 10-15 minutes no problem. It's been very useful for when I have to quickly make and eat lunch while I'm home alone.The leaves that open and close mesmerize my son and he seems to love the brightly-colored rainforest creatures. The base unit also plays pleasant classical music and has a nice, warm nightlight (both of which don't seem to do anything for my guy, though). Putting together the mobile wasn't too difficult either, considering that I managed to do it all by myself WHILE carrying my son in a front-load baby carrier. The base wouldn't screw onto the front or back of my baby's crib (Europa baby Geneva crib), but it's been fine on the side rail, closer to the backside of the crib."
29,Rubbermaid G780-04 Pva Roller Mop,0/0,5.0,THIS IS THE BEST SPONGE MOM I HAVE EVER USED- IM 50 SO IVE BEEN THRU ALOT-THIS IS SO SMOOTH TO USE-SUPER ABSORBANT AND DOES NOT LEAVE EDGE STREAKS LIKE MOST SPONGE MOPS DO- I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS MOP UNTIL ITS OUT OF PRODUCTION- IM ORDERING EXTRAS TO PUT BACK IN CASE THEY BECOME NO LONGER AVAILABLE--****THIS IS A SPONGE MOP LIKE NO OTHER*** AND 5 STARS DOES IT NO JUSTICE-ID GIVE IT 10 STARS....
30,Cat-A'bout Single-Cat CatNip Plus Tub 60 grams by MiracleCorp/Gimborn,0/0,1.0,"I wouldn't buy this product again if it was 'free'... I followed the directions to the letter, and all I got was a sterile cup of soil that ended up molding over time. When I tried to contact Gimborn Pet Specialties about it, noone ever responded to my emails or letters..."
31,"NOW Foods Creatine Monohydrate 1500mg, 100 Tablets",1/1,4.0,Just got it and I can feel it working abt an hour after taking it and made me lift more and throw up more reps!
32,Indigo Wild,0/0,5.0,"Love,Love,Love this baby soap. It smells so good, and I can wash even the little guys hair with it. I got a bar as a gift, and have been going back for more :)"
33,"Spindrift 144 Fleece Lined Cozy Dog Collar - Large (3/4"" x 19-23""), Brick",3/3,5.0,"I have 2 pit bulls, i used to have regular cheap nylon collars, i know they were uncomfortable for them, im very close with my dogs so they are always in my face and the collar would always catch a hair on my beard, so i know it sucked for them. i need to keep a collar on them for the Easy Defense Flea & Tick Tag that i use [...] so i got these nice collars and they are great i can feel there's no area that snags hairs, i tested that on my own face first. Only the best for my dogs."
34,Battle Ravaged Spider-Man,0/0,5.0,"I've had this thing for 10 years, and in that time it has seen plenty of use. It's been dropped and flung countless times, yet it's still in great condition. It's also a very accurate representation of the final fight scene in the movie. I would recommend this to any Spidey fans looking to find a great collectible figure from the first film."
35,SENSE-ible No-Pull Dog Harness - Black Large,0/0,5.0,"My sister was looking for something that her bulldog could not pull out of when they took their evening walks. I saw this on Amazon and ordered it for her, because of all the positive reviews. It works great and has made thier walks much easier and pleasant."
36,Honeybee Gardens Jobacolors Eye Liner,0/0,5.0,"I use Honeybee Gardens JobaColors Eyeliner Pencil in Jet Set as a natural eyebrow pencil. It allows me to fill in my black eyebrows for a full, natural look.I used to use Ecco Bella Eyeliner Pencil in Velvet as an eyebrow pencil but I prefer this product. Compared to Ecco Bella Eyeliner Pencil, it's cheaper, less soft/smudgy and is free of hydrogenated oils (not good for your body, may cause acne).Ingredients"
37,Fisher-Price Little People Animal Sounds Farm,3/3,2.0,"I purchased this farm for my son who is just under a year old. He loved to play with the one at his grandma's house (an older version purchased at a garage sale a few years back) so I thought I would buy one for our house, too. When I took it out of the box, the silo section was not connected. I connected it without too much trouble but then opened the farm and the silo fell off. It continues to fall off all of the time! I have given up trying to keep the pieces together - it is a waste of my time. The farm animals now share stalls in the barn -making it a bit harder to make the animal sounds. It appears that the toy has been ""remodeled"" to be less expensive to make. The plastic is thinner, the quality poorer, and the spaces/stalls for the animals smaller and more complicated. It is still darn cute and my son likes to play with it -it just is not the same quality it used to be."
38,Garden of Life Primal Defense,1/2,3.0,"My intent was to add this to home-made ice cream to make a sort of frozen yogurt, since I don't care for the tart yogurt taste of actual frozen yogurt. While this wasn't the best product for that purpose, since it's very green, it was extremely effective as a probiotic. I add it to water, it dissolves well, and I drink it plain. My stomach issues have been dramatically reduced by using this product. I would highly recommend this."
39,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,Pampers diapers are excellent for the babies who are sensitive to the diaper rash. they worked well on my baby skin.
40,St.Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse (select size),0/0,5.0,"I'm naturally very pale, and it's been hard getting tan, sun or no sun. I used to tan in tanning beds and outdoors, I loved the color I got but was very worried about sun cancer and aging skin. So I started experimenting with many different sunless tanners, prices ranging from $5 to $60. I was disappointed with most, either they left me looking very orange or yellow and/or very streaky. I finally decided to order the St. Tropez bronzing mousse after hearing great things about it. It really does live up to the hype in my opinion; it dries quickly, gives instant color, and after showering it off the next day it looks very natural. The color didn't turn out as deep as I expected, but it was still a nice golden color and I'm sure with a second application the day after it would turn out even darker, which I have yet to try. The scent is nice, I still get the sunless tan smell the next day but it isn't as bad as some other brands I've tried. It does stain palms, so I use cheap latex gloves to apply the tanner, then use a tiny bit on the tops of my hands.The price is somewhat high, but honestly if the bronzing mousse was $100 I would still buy it so I think it's completely worth every penny. It lasts me a while if I use it 1-2 times a week. I hope they never stop making this product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting natural color."
41,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,0/0,4.0,"This toy is very durable. My granddaughter, who is 7-1/2 months, has fun playing with the pieces even if she can't quite get them in their correct holes yet."
42,Hot Sock Diffuser,0/0,3.0,"It sort of works? I had to tie a rubber band around my blow dryer to get it to stay on (and I have a large blow dryer) it seemed to work, I don't know. It also takes FOREVER to blow dry your hair with this. Without the sock, it takes about 5 minutes. With the sock on, it takes about 30!!"
43,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"My lab loved the little animals - we had to buy a replacement set because he couldn't get enough of them. My Cavalier Spaniel loves the log more than the animals. She loves to put her head inside the holes and toss the log around. This toy has lasted years and multiple dogs. Totally worth the investment. The log shows some sign of where, but this is incredible considering we've had it about five years now."
44,Source Naturals Spirulina Powder,0/0,4.0,"Haven't noticed a major difference from the rest, but its a good price and seemingly good quality. I keep it in the refrigerator to preserve freshness."
45,"Farmer Brothers Buttermilk Pancake Mix, 5lb Bag",0/0,5.0,I love Farmer Brothers Buttermilk Pancake mix. I used it all the time when the kids were little. I used to get it form a lady that sold food form different company's out of her house. I thought they didn't make it anymore. was looking for some seasoning and ran across farmer Brothers. It is really easy to use. I would buy if your looking for something quick and easy.
46,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head,0/0,5.0,"The two brush heads were in a well sealed box so they did not get damaged. They were wrapped in plastic also. They seem to work fine, no problems. Sonicare is supposed to be really good for getting rid of plaque."
47,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,1/2,1.0,"I own a condo and unfortunately some young renters moved in above me and they are obnoxiously loud at all hours. They act like they live in a dorm! I was hoping this item would help to drown out some of the noise, but it doesn't at all. It just sounds like a box fan turned on low even with all the holes opened up on it. I actually bought a Homedics Nature Sound Machine with volume control that works 10x better than this thing! I need to return this because it's not worth the $50 and change. I am very dissapointed because it got such good reviews. It doesn't drown out anything. I had it on high and I heard a truck drive by and the sound was the same as if it was turned off. I really can't think of who would benefit from this thing! It's definitely not good for apartment or condo living that's for sure!"
48,Macks safe sound soft foam earplugs -10 pair,0/0,5.0,"I work nights, and I live in a house with a very noisy family with a 3 year old and this was the solution to all my problems. I have tried a lot of different brands, and different types of earplugs within this same brand and none of them worked as good as these ones.It is true they only last around 3 or 4 uses in my case but the box is quite cheap and well worth it.I do have one ear canal smaller than the other one, on one ear they fit perfectly and in the other they hurt a bit and ended up not fitting well at all but I figured that an option (which I don't know how it would work for everybody but that's what I did) was to flat out the earplug and cut just A LITTLE bit with scissors and they would fit perfectly. The noise is not blocked as perfectly as with the other one but it is still a huge difference if you learn how much you need to cut. I might be the weird one here but it might be helpful for some people that couldn't make them fit. And in my case I tried smaller ones but they didn't block the noise at all in my compared to these ones"
49,"Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Summer Strawberry, 0.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 30)",0/0,5.0,"I love this snack, it's not too sugary and is healthy for the kids. I would recommend this any day over fruit rollup or other similar products."
50,Cardinal Laboratories Crazy Pet Bumble Ball (Various Colors),0/0,4.0,"so far, it is working and my puppy loves the toy. I'm affraid when the batteries need to be changed, but it is not happening yet. We have it for a month and probably played for 10 min. It made well and light enough so that little westy can carry."
51,Lady-Comp Fertility Monitor - Fahrenheit,2/2,5.0,"My husband and I decided we were ready to start a family in early 2011. I began keeping track of my monthly menstral cycle and tried various fertility methods like urination strips/sticks. we also spoke with our doctors and informed them about what we were trying to accomplish. After 7 months and no progress, my husband purchased this product after reading many positive reviews. I started using lady-comp the week following christmas 2011. I followed all the instructions"
52,Barbie Collector Pink Label - Dolls of the World - Princess of the Pacific Islands,0/1,1.0,"The Barbie doll looks different compared to the picture. It is not exactly shown on the picture. Th really one looks much more used. I don't like this product but since I don't want to pay shipping for returning, I decided to keep it."
53,"Finish Powerball Tablets, Orange Scent",0/0,4.0,Ive been gettting these through Subscribe and Save for a while. Does a great job cleaning the dishes. Couple it with Finish drying agent and you are in great shape. My only complaint is that the red ball falls out of the other piece more than it stays in so you have to be careful handling them or you will be chasing it around your kitchen.
54,"Huichol Hot Sauce, 6.5 oz.",0/0,5.0,A must purchase if you love good flavors. This sauce is unique to a small region in Mexico. I credit Amazon for supplying it! Give it a try...it's very tasty!
55,Worlds Freshest Spray Millet 5 Pound Box Nemeth Farms the Original,0/0,5.0,"I agree with others that shipping the sprays in a plastic bag within the box would be terrific. That said, my sprays were huge, 2-3 inches longer than my store-bought brand from Petco. They were fresh and had long stems that can be tied together with a rubberband and hung from the top of the cage. My birds luv millet, but they really went after this light-golden variety. The sprays are very clean. I highly recommend this product."
56,Badger Basket Company Natural Baby Moses Basket,0/0,2.0,I was scared to let my baby sleep in the basket at night b/c I was scared he would get pushed up against the sides. Good for napping though. Can't beat the price.
57,Champion Nutrition Ultramet,0/0,5.0,"This is, for me, a great meal replacement product to be used both pre-workout in a blended fruit and yogurt drink and post workout by itself. The best price I have found is here on Amazon and will purchase again as I have in the past."
58,"Syntrax Nectar Whey Protein Isolate, Powder",0/0,5.0,"I've tried a good number of protein powders in the last 30+ years. The taste of protein powders, in my opinion are bad. So bad in fact that it has been difficult for me to be consistent in their consumption. The health food stores always steer you towards their latest greatest powders. When asked what type of feedback they have been getting as far as taste goes, they always reply ""good."" I am never that enthusiastic because when I try them they have a chemical taste, such as Muscle Milk does, or some other bad taste that ends up tasting terrible to me in about the second week.The Nectar Cappuccino is a different story. I mix it with 2% milk. I've solved my protein powder problem."
59,Optimum Mega Potency HMB,1/2,4.0,"This supplement work pretty good in helping increase lean mass, I did an expirment and did not take this a few weeks and notice my fat burning was not doing as a good job without this suppplement, , so for best value go with this, for best hmb supplement I have personally tried go with the eas version, they used to call it betagen but I belive it has new name for it, the eas has hmb and creatine so thus of course should work better"
60,"PetSafe Freedom Door, Premium White",2/2,4.0,"Easy enough to install. Works great as long as you keep the areas where the magnetic strips make contact with the metal clean. I give the door a detailed cleaning about once a week. Replacement flaps are over priced in my opinion. However, I have had the same door for about three years and have only had to replace the flap once. The door has held up to my 2 Shelties and a German Shepherd that I am caring for until it's owner returns from overseas. Just moved so I purchased the same door and installed it at my new residence as it has been a good door overall."
61,Catalina Titanium Heater 500 Watt,0/0,5.0,This was a total surprise in how accurate it is. Only wish they had an 800watt for my 180 reef. But do use it with another heater. The other heater only goes on if for some reason the temp drops over a degree which has not happened yet.A++++++++++++ Can you say bargain....
62,Mud Pie Baby Piggy Bank,0/0,5.0,"So, this is actually the second one we've had. The first one I received as a gift for my baby shower, for my now 4 year old. Her 1 year old younger sister got a hold of it and through it on the ground. Yes, it will break if you throw it on the ground. So, as a I frantically ran to the internet to find an identical replacement, I turned to Amazon. I was so happy to find the exact same piggy bank. My 4 year old was so happy to have it back. Very cute decoration for her room, and of course, she loves to put her money in it."
63,SmartScoop No-Stick Litter Box Spray,1/1,5.0,"I sprayed this stuff on when I first bought my boxes and several months later I still haven't had to reapply. My cat's are fans of making the litter clump at the bottom of the box, but with this spray it's not hard to get off. I also recommend you spray your scooper! Great product!"
64,"Method Daily Shower Spray, Ylang-Ylang Formula, 28-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 8)",1/3,3.0,"I just bought this to try on my bathtub because we always get ""pink mold"" even though I clean our tub every 2 weeks. I heard this should be very effective against that. Will update on its effectively but in the mean time just want to let those who are interested that this can be found cheaper at Target"
65,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,4.0,"These knee highs were great the first time I wore them. After a few uses, the top band would not hold them up anymore, and they sagged. Good feel on your foot, good color, sheer enough."
66,30' Large Dog Tie Out Cable Leash,2/2,5.0,"Great product! Bought many in pet stores and latches failed in less than 8 mos. The cable color fades in the Florida sun, but latch remains pliable in the wet summers. Will order again!"
67,Marina Black Coarse Nylon Fish Net,0/0,5.0,"It's a fish net, not much to say about it, I got it on here for cheaper than pet stores and it does what it's supposed to do."
68,Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer,0/0,5.0,"I downgraded from a Chi (that burnt out after about two years) and a higher priced dryer from a beauty supply store, and I would recommend this mid-priced dryer as well as any of them.It does not seem overly heavy to me, as other reviewers have noticed, nor have I had issues with accidentally hitting the temperature or off switches because of their placement. It does get very, very hot on the ""hot"" setting, but the ""warm"" setting is just as good if you can't take the heat.Few reviewers have mentioned the extra-long cord, which is a major positive selling point for me. All in all, I've decided it's crazy to spend up to $150 or even $75 on a dryer when this ~$40 one works just as well if not better and has the extra long cord."
69,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,4.0,Cats love it! Certain cats may not like this type of toy as they like to have the small ones to kick and scratch around with.
70,Prairie View Industries Portable Singlefold Ramp,1/1,5.0,"These are perfect for us! I got tired of borrowing a friend's ramps to load my husband's electric wheelchair so I bought these. He used them for his bus trip to Canada with my daughter's GS troop. They are lightweight enough that my husband and the kids could lift them, but sturdy enough that they handled the weight of the wheelchair. We stand ours up on end for storage so they don't take up a lot of space - they might even fit behind a piece of furniture.My only dislike with these ramps is that the handle could be a little more ergonomic/comfortable. It's not bad if you're just picking them up, but if you have to carry them any distance (i.e. from the house/hotel to the car) your hand will probably hurt a little.Overall, I am quite happy with these ramps."
71,Mustela Bebe Multi Sensory Bubble Bath,1/1,5.0,"I know it's supposed to be for babies but I just love this bubble bath! It smells clean, like soap, and not all perfume-y. The whole bathroom smells great afterwards - too bad I can't get the whole house to smell like this or I'd never leave home, lol."
72,Hair No More Hair No More Inhibitor,0/0,1.0,I have to delete my previous recommendation of this product. The new stuff I got isn't the same formula - it smells bad enough that I can't use it. For someone not sensitive to odors it may be okay.
73,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/1,5.0,"This is a good product at a good price. Duracell batteries are the way to go. They are very reliable, long lasting, and cheap. You can't get better batteries for cheaper. I have used Duracell batteries for years and always found them to be reliable for powering all kinds of electronic devices, and long lasting enough not to break the bank. I have also never had a problem with leakage."
74,Swede-O Trim Lok Ankle Brace,0/0,2.0,"It was true-to-size and 'fit'. The sewing and materials are very good, BUT!!!...It does not hold the ankle at a 90deg angle. The 'stiffening' isn't stiff at all, and not only offers ZERO support, but leaves a bulky u-shape that puts pressure on the soft tissue around the ankle. The material is bulky and does not fit into shoes easily or comfortably. It has no stretch around the calf so it bites into the hamstring & achilles tendon. The lacing is difficult to use at best, it has to be completely un-laced and re-laced every time the brace is removed/put on. Also, the lacing is angled such-that it does not tighten at the 'bend' in the front of the ankle, so it does not hold the ankle steady forward/back either. Since this brace offered no side-side or forward-back support, didn't fit in my shoes, and was actually painfully tight around the calf, (in other words, it dosen't do anything the description says it'll do) I returned it."
75,ACQUA DI GIO by Giorgio Armani (WOMEN),1/1,5.0,"The product itself is great, however, i requested a gift note ""Just Because :)"" and it was not with the package. Also, i requested to have the price hidden because it was a gift, and the price was not hidden and the person I got it for even commented on the price, which of course is why it was supposed to be hidden."
76,Snoozer Lookout Car Seat,0/0,5.0,"I have two of these one black and one beige. I got one on line for full price, and the other at a flea market can you believe for 5 bucks it was new.These are great and I would pay full price for both, it is well worth the cost. You can take off the cover and wash it.My dog loves it he can sit and look out at the world I drive, it is elevated just high enough."
77,Trend Lab Diaper Stacker,0/0,4.0,"We found this diaper stacker to get the job done. It is made of a very white square patterned fabric, not your typical ""pique"" so we were a bit disappointed by that. Also, the base and top are lined with cardboard, which isn't great to put in the washing machine, but we took the base out and washed the rest and it held up in the wash fine--and we hung to dry. It holds 3 rows of diapers if you tightly pack, otherwise two rows, essentially one giant box! We were very happy and surprised with that! We tied ours (two ties at the top) to a fabric-covered hanger, and it has worked beautifully. This is extremely basic, not ""luxe"" in any way, but classic and we have been pleased with it!"
78,Futurebiotics Silver (Colloidal),1/2,3.0,thought this to be holly grail.been reading about the difference between ionic and real silver.seems ionic is better for topical non is good for ingestion. will stick with organic virgin coconut oil.
79,"Carlson 0930PW Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door, White",4/7,1.0,"I am very disappointed with the description of this gate. When I searched ""Baby Gate with Cat opening"" this gate came up. After reading the entire description it sounded like what I was looking for.... until I got it.... this gate is NOT to be used as a baby gate! It does not state that ANYWHERE in the description and the best part.... I couldn't even return the gate... so I just wasted 45 bucks on something I can't even use... this gate is to gate off dogs but still allowing a cat to roam... very disappointed!"
80,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,I love optimum nutrition Im not a very serious bodybuilder but I do workout and use this after every workout. Dissolves easily into water and taste ok. I don't really care for taste though.
81,Cascade Canister Filter Pumps for Fresh & Saltwater Aquariums - UL Listed,0/0,5.0,"I'm new to aquariums but after doing my research I chose to go with the Cascade 1500. I have a 100 gal freshwater tank and this thing is doing the trick very nicely. My water quality is perfect so far so I have to attribute that in part to good filtration. The best part of it all is that I asked the local aquarium store owner what the best unit for my tank was (after I had already ordered this one) and he was trying to sell me this one. In the store they had it listed for the ""everyday low prices"" of $349.99! This thing was a deal and I highly recommend it."
82,"Hagen Parrot VME Pro-Mix Seed, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,This bird seed mix has the highest amount of safflower seeds I have seen. There are a few shelled peanuts and a few other things...but mostly safflower. I blend this with other bird seed mixes and my double yellow head Amazon loves it. There are no shells to clean up - trust me...plenty else to clean up from Normy.
83,Aquolina Pink Sugar,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful, beautiful, sexy, romantic.. flawless.. best money I ever spent.Makes you feel quite sexy and men notice it right away."
84,Avalon Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"I decided to try one of the natural shampoos after moving to the city (DC) and trying to lessen my exposure to chemicals. I work in a biotech lab and use alot of the chemicals found in normal shampoo on a daily basis. I decided I just didn't need such harsh surfactants (SLS) and cleating agents (EDTA, etc) when all I was trying to do was wash off some sebum. I am a particularly sweaty person and this shampoo cuts through the grease in my medium length hair no problem and has a sweet mango scent. Gets a good lather, smells good, organic and not tested on animals (which is just a bonus to me), less chemicals what more could you ask for?"
85,Sportsheets Beginners Bondage Fantasy Kit,0/0,3.0,"This set comes as shown in the picture.The material is soft and nice to wear.The mask though is a bit big and the elastic is long, so you can see out from around your nose where it does not fit tight, which kind of defeats the whole purpose.The restrains are sturdy and come with a long strap that can be tied around wherever you wanna be tied up to.I would have given it more stars if the mask was not so big and the elastic starp was not so long or worn out that it slips of your face, might have to do some improvements myself :)Altogether a good beginners set."
86,"CLic Adjustable Front Connect Reader, 2.00 Strength",1/1,2.0,Sent them back. Was not what I was expecting. The head band part is ridged and not flexable. Uncomfortable over ears and forget about having a ponytail in because it will not fit over or under one.
87,Perio Therapy Gum Care Gel Toothpaste - 3.5 Oz,1/1,5.0,"No place in my town sells this product. I took a chance on it when I saw it on amazon and I am glad I did. I have used many kinds of both herbal and regular toothpaste and mouthwashes over the years but none were able to stop a raging gum infection I had picked up from somewhere after many years of being told by dentists my mouth was very healthy. This is more expensive than other toothpastes but it is the only one I will use from now on as it is the only one that seems to be able to keep the bad bacteria at bay. I use it with the companion mouthwash of the same name.I recommend this toothpaste and the mouthwash intended to be used with it to anyone. The mouthwash, to some people, has a funny taste, but that is just because it is hydrogen peroxide based and that is what you taste.If you buy it as a set (they sell it this way on amazon and you can find it if you look), you get a free mouthpiece so you can use the toothpaste as a tooth whitener, too."
88,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,5.0,Strong when you first put it on but then it is very mild. For some one who's allergic to a lot of this kind of stuff it is the only perfume i use.
89,Maximus Personal Lubricant,0/0,5.0,"This is a repeat order. This is the best lube I have found. Not greasy, no residue and lasts. Excellent value product."
90,"Tetra Whisper Power Filter 30, 30-Gallon",0/0,5.0,"This is a simple inexpensive filter that works pretty well for aquariums. The design is pretty simple, the pump sucks up water which passes through activated carbon to remove toxic chemicals and then past a sponge to filter out suspended particles. More serious aquarium enthusiasts will probably want to add more filtration power to their tank but this filter does a pretty good basic job.Setup is real simple, just put everything together per the instructions and then hang over the side and plug in. I have found this power filter to be pretty quiet. I've installed this in two tanks. In one tank the water level is low and the splashing water covers the pump noise so I don't hear any pump noise. In the other tank, the water level is high, there is no water splash but the filter is hidden by the cabinet so I don't hear anything either. So either way, I'm pleased with the quietness of both filters.Most filter companies sell a basic power filter with the same basic design and I suppose all will work the same. Right now this filter is at a really good price so go for it!"
91,"Demeter Fragrance Library - Plants, Trees and Leaves - Cologne Collection",0/0,4.0,"I was under the impression, from the descriptions of the product line, that this cologne would smell like what it's called; i.e., grass. I was expecting something with a smell like fresh-cut grass. While it's a nice scent - it's lightly floral and long-lasting - it doesn't smell like grass. I'm a bit disappointed even though I do like whatever scent this actually is."
92,Kama Sutra Massage Oil 8 oz,0/0,4.0,Smells good and I could feel a tingling sensation on a few sore muscles. After a few more uses I'll either increase or decrease the star rating .update
93,Worldwide Sport - R-T-D Pure Protein,1/2,2.0,I received three kinds of these shakes and for some reason the only one that had damage and busted cans were the cookies and creme...You could tell from the outside of the box it had busted cans but this product was sent anyway. The chocoloate and banana flavors were just fine so it was not a shipping issue. I do think I'll buy these from here again as I lost three cans.
94,Zeasorb Prevention Super Absorbent Powder,3/3,5.0,I have used Zeasorb for many years. I sent a case to a friend who was stationed in Afghanistan. he said it was the best thing they had gotten. NOTE
95,BABYBJORN Safe Step,0/0,5.0,"This is the second baby bjorn step stool we have purchased. It is simple, it works well, no moving parts for my baby to get into while crawling, and allows my daughter to wash her hands by herself. Wonderful."
96,Doggy Pal,2/3,1.0,":ooks great and wanted two more for a woman who owned two of these dogs to run around her Christmas tree but I guess not if they can't work right. It wasn't just that the screw for it is so hard to turn- it's that it doesn't work out of the box. Too bad it looked super cool if the replacement doesn't work I'll give up on Westminter. Have y'all noticed a trend that increasingly product doesn't work right. I remember the old stuff never let you down. Oh well I'll wait for more on demand content and newer technologies to bail me out. But now I have holes in the new dishwasher that doesn't clean the dishes right. Man what happened to USA pride when the produet that was bad was so obvious to detect and the rest was solid and with the best parts and so on. C'mon people have some pride in your country. I mean I go to target and buy their signature line Mandolon and it's so dull and just leaves my potatoes for Potato chips in shreds and pieces too think to use. In the past you'd now this is a bad product- now... Fortunately most of the stuff I bought for the microwave has been great and meant I can have fully cooked and delicious vegetables and other ings like Candy, tender and heavily flavored stews in under 30 minutes without cleanup. Who would have known that that plus a Forman grill is all I need to cook well and many different dishes too. I guess the NY Times critic is right when he says that it's all a game by the top chefs to make you think they are more impressive because he spies on them in their homes and sees them cooking with the Microwave for things they say they will only cook on a stove because the microwave will kill it. A lot of lies in our world folks. Wow I wish my Doggie Pal wouild work because it rules!!!"
97,Durex Condoms,1/1,3.0,The product is decent. In my own perspective the product was too small for me but worked. I am aware that the product is supposed to be tight but shouldn't suffocate my penis. Feeling was good with 4 varieties. 3 Were lubricated only slightly and 1 wasnt at all.Did include a coupon incase i ever buy again!
98,Carr's - Ginger Lemon Creme Cookies - 7.05 oz,0/0,5.0,Just the right amount of sweet and is perfect for coffee and tea breaks. Does not have the artificial taste so many ginger cookies have.
99,Mill Creek Botanicals Biotene H-24,0/0,5.0,Great product keeps your hair shiny and in place. There is nothing else to say except its a great product
100,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",1/1,5.0,"I bought this for my maltese, needless to say, It's perfectIt's big enough to fit food, water, bed, and tons of toys for my dog.I can even fit wee wee pad, but he won't go on wee wee pad,and hold it until I come home from work.. (I still leave wee wee pad just in case)It's so cute he keeps going in and out to get his toys, drink water, and eat his food when I leave the door openIf you don't believe in putting your dog in the regular kennel crate,this is perfect,, (I definitely do not want to put my dog in that small crate, locked up)Easy to put together (I am girl, and was able to do it by myself)there are little rubber pieces that comes with in order to prevent sliding,durable, and ITs' pretty!"
101,Bio-Ionic Travel Pro Hair Dryer,1/1,5.0,I bought this product for my sister and wife since they love the regular size Bio-Ionic dryer. Easier for them to carry when they go away on trips. Definitely recommend it.
102,Showerhead Self-Pressurizing Shower Fixture SkinCare Shower-Gold Finish With Comfort Control,0/3,4.0,"If your water pressure is okay and you are not too concerned about saving money, don't buy this. It's a great showerhead and I love it, but it takes some getting used to.Let's just say... buy it if you want something different and are not happy at all with your current showerhead."
103,"Just the Cheese Mini Round Snacks, 0.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 16)",1/2,2.0,"I used to eat ""Just the Cheese"" when it was in bigger bags a few years ago and they were good. But the snack size are just too salty.No problems with seller though. I received my order quickly."
104,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,This has been a godsend for housebreaking my step-daughter's little yorkie. The removable plastic bottom is great and cleans easily. This popped together in about 30 seconds. It is very sturdy and the little latch that opens and closes the door is great. Perfection in a wire crate.
105,Desolv It Citrus Solution 12.6oz,0/0,5.0,"I bought this to remove the insulin pump my son wears, as well as a glucose monitor sensor he wears. After a few short minutes the tape slides right off of him. No more painful tugging or pulling to get the tape off of him. Hiding this from my husband who will want to use it on all kinds of stuff! :)"
106,S&B - Hot Mustard Powder 3.0 Oz.,0/0,5.0,"if you love the hot mustard at Chinese Restaurants and want that same taste at home, this is the real deal. It it a dry mustard and all you do is add a little water when you want some. The nice thing is you can make as little or as much as you need at a time but be careful! It is very potent."
107,Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"I cannot say enough about how amazing this leave-in conditioner is. I have below-the-shoulders wavy/frizzy/poofy hair that has yet to be tamed by a single product. I usually straighten it because it is too unmanageable and unpredictable if I let it air-dry. This conditioner keeps it under control, lets it do its natural-wavy thing, but isn't too heavy or greasy. I am white, and would recommend this conditioner for women of all races and ethnicities. LOVE it!!"
108,Dermalogica Sheer Tint Moisture SPF15 (Light) - 40ml/1.3oz,0/0,5.0,"I have used this product in the past so it was a no brainer to purchase it here for a good price! I like the dark tint because it is sheer enough to give barely a hint of color and looks great. Even though I have olive skin tone, I have no tan this year after just having a baby and it never looks fake or ""make up-y"""
109,"Clean & Clear Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, 0.75-Ounce Tube",0/1,2.0,"I'm gonna have to disagree with the claim that it doesnt over dry skin .. it definitely does. I put this on as directed for two nights, nothing happened. it wasn't until the fourth day that I noticed all the peeling happening around my pimples where i put the product. was soooo drying, made the parts of my skin dry and flaky and gross. i peeled off the skin, because it was just too disgusting not to. It did clear up my skin a bit, but it wasn't worth all the nasty peeling. Would not recommend, would not buy again."
110,Calcium Magnesium Citrate w/ Vit D 2:1 By Solaray - 180 Vegetable Caps,3/3,5.0,I am a vegan and have arthritis - so I am vitamin D deficient and need calcium since I don't do dairy. If you need calcium - you should take magnesium and D with it - to make it effective. I take a lot of supplements so price does matter. The Solaray - Cal-Mag Citrate + D has everything I want and is the best price on the web.
111,"KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Red",0/0,5.0,"I have spent so much money on toys for my puppy who chews EVERYTHING! He chews on wires, couches and door frames as well, but now that I have given this toy to chew on it is his new favorite. It is EXTREMELY durable even after two months of intensive chewing. Have recommended it to many of my friends with pups, a great choice."
112,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,4.0,"Packaging is very easy to open, for me it does taste a little too salty but still enjoyable. I have a 6oz. popcorn maker however when I use the entire packet towards the end it want's to pop off the top so I may try the 4oz. next time. The only complaint I have is when I received this package due to the extreme heat we have had this summer by the time I received it some of the packets the oil/butter had leaked through and was a little messy as I had to wipe off each packet and throw away a couple."
113,Revell 1:100 F-16 Fighting Falcon,0/0,1.0,I have bought 100s of items from Amazon and this is my first review. I ordered the item based on the catchy picture and dimensions mentioned. What I recieved is no where near the quality based on the impression you get from the photos. It was made of cheap plastic and the dimensions were incorrect too like some other review had mentioned. Very very cheap and false advertisement. The small free toys you get with McDonald's Happy meal are better than this in quality..
114,Bach Essence Star of Bethlehem 20 Milliliters,0/0,5.0,My husband uses this. He has severe COPD and if he starts to get anxious - he takes just a few drops and it settles him down.
115,Safety 1st Railnet,4/5,1.0,I received this product and upon taking it out of it's packaging was overwhelmed by the smell of chemicals on it. It smelled like someone had drowned the two of them in bug spray (like as in raid for wasps type bug spray). We let it air out for a few days but nothing helped. In the end we disposed of them. Just horrible!!!! I wouldnt let me child anywhere near these.
116,"Chimes Original Ginger Chews, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)",0/0,5.0,Great taste. If they have any health benefit that would be a bouns. They seem to stay fresh a long time and are 1/2 the price here as compared to the world market.
117,"Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews",0/0,5.0,So far I have had good results with the Smart Chews keeping my numbers down. They are very tasty and smooth! Hoping my next check-up has a good report.
118,Pacific Shaving Company All Natural Shaving Oil-2 oz,1/1,4.0,"The best I have tried for shaving oil. However, my order arrived and only one bottle was shipped, even though the image implies that the purchase is for two bottles. After looking at other products offered by Pacific Shaving Company, it seems that they frequently use misleading images (showing two items when the price is for only one). Not sure why they do that. Otherwise, a great product.I also agree with other reviewers that it probably won't last 400 shaves (from my experience, I would guess about 150), but it is great for travel and for being able to see what you are shaving."
119,Hand Bulb Ear Syringes- 3 oz. Each - Sterile Blister Bag,0/0,5.0,"Delivery was fast (4 days after ordering). The first item they shipped me had a tiny defect (1mm diameter pit on the body). After contacting the seller, they shipped another one for me right away (great customer service). The new one is perfect, light green in color and sturdy. I use it to blow dust so don't know its suction power for other purposes (it sucks water just fine). the tip of my 3oz bulb is ~6mm (outer diameter)and ~3-4mm (opening/inner diameter)in size so might not fit into baby nose. You might wanna get a smaller bulb for that. If anyone cares about product origin, it says ""made in China"" on the bottom. It comes in a sealed individual package, and the plastic is good quality and doesn't have strong odor. I noticed there is a ridge across the center of the body, which is different from the bulbs I used to have (my old bulbs from a chemical supply shop all had smooth body without any visible ridge on the body). But it doesn't affect usage."
120,Atkins Advantage Bar Chocolate Peanut Butter,0/0,5.0,"WOW Atkins bars can be hit and miss with flavor but this one is outstanding! Its so good that I have to keep them way at the other end of house so I don't eat them all!A real winner, it tastes like an incredible candy bar. Do try them, they are great!"
121,ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,0/0,5.0,This is the best tasting coconut water out there!I have tried many but Zico tastes like it was just poured from a freshly plucked coconut.
122,Now Foods Glucosamine & Chondroitin with MSM,0/0,5.0,I have been using NOW brand supplements for some time because of the high quality and purity of their products.I just broke my right calcaneus (heel bone) and am taking this product (as well as softgel calcium pills) to make sure my body gets everything it needs to heal.Thanks NOW Foods for making such great supplements at affordable prices!PS

124,Canidae Dry Dog Food for All Life Stages,0/0,4.0,"I like this dog's food for my dog, it's high quality and not too expensive. I have to say though that the bag came all ragged and opened."
125,Dior Homme Cologne by Christian Dior for men Colognes,2/3,5.0,"It's close to a perfectly crafted fragrance. This scent is built around lavender, iris, and cocoa. The opening drives some people nuts. It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick. Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray. I rather like the smell, but I can see how it would not appeal to everyone. After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own. The iris is pushed to the sideline, though it is still noticeable. Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender. While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender. But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa. This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent. It's not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience. Dior Homme projects well throughout its 6-7 hour lifespan. Note"
126,"Beefeaters Pig Ears Chews for Dogs, 25-pack",1/1,3.0,"We have been paying $16 for 12 pig ears at a local store for our dogs, which is about $1.25 per ear. This pig ears from the local store are huge though. Now, I bought these Beefeater pig ears off of Amazon, 25 for $22. At this price, I paid about 88 cents per pig ear. I guess I got what I paid for. Unfortunately, these Beefeater pig ears are tiny compared to what we were getting! They are about 2 inches by 3 inches....it only occupies my dog for about three minutes. So, I will not be ordering these again."
127,Cococare Cocoa Butter lip balm - 0.15 Oz,0/0,4.0,"The product is nice and it conditions very well, but i gave it 4 stars since it comes in the mail in the envelope but when i take the lip balm out...there is no covering on it or case."
128,Source Naturals St. John's Wort 300mg,0/0,5.0,I have had mild depression for a long time - but not bad enough for prescription drugs that have lots of side effects. I've tried several and the side effects were just too much. I take 2 Source Naturals St. John's Wort 4 times a day and feel very normal. It doesn't make me happy or loopy - just normal. St John's Wort can be expensive...and this is a great price.
129,Met-Rx Big 100 Meal Replacement Bars 12 ea,0/0,5.0,These taste so great! I highly recommend and I get a box every month! Only issue is the sugar level but it's a meal replacement bar.

132,VIBRANT HEALTH Green Vibrance Powder,1/1,5.0,"Highly recommend this product. I was introduced to it by a friend who was recommended its use to help boost immunity and blood cell content. I have used this product daily for the past 5 years. I have improved my immunity against sinus infections and general sickness, my bowels are regulated, and have more consistent energy through out the day. No more afternoon lulls, feeling so much better and as a result more active."
133,Pre de Provence Soap,1/1,5.0,"I have almost all of the soaps from this company. They are wonderful. This one, along with the pineapple or tangerine is great for summer. The smell is so fresh and wonderful. I love it. It lathers well and rinses clean."

136,OP Juice Cologne by Ocean Pacific for men Colognes,1/1,2.0,Owned this stuff years and years and years ago.. Smelled great then and I wanted more.. but the spray mechanism broke back in the day after I used about 70 percent of the bottle... This time it just arrived broke.. I understand that things wear out after time.. and that failures are bound to occur.. but why would a company put a great smelling cologne in a bottle that makes it virtually worthless.. it's ridiculous..will not buy again..
137,Educational Insights Castle Logix,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old got this for Christmas and took to it immediately. He loves puzzles and the cute chunky pieces are very appealing. He played with it for hours and 6 months later it still comes out often as a favourite bedtime game. My 8 and 10 year old also liked it a lot -- they skipped straight to the hardest puzzles (which are a struggle for a four year old, but can be mastered through trial and error if they stick to it) and really enjoyed working them out logically. I wish they sold an extension booklet with more and harder puzzles that my older sons could enjoy going forward. Great toy! Highly recommended!"
138,Melissa & Doug Jumbo Triangular Crayons,0/0,5.0,"I bought them year ago for my 1.5 years old and she still uses them. They are big, just right size for little hands. Colors are very nice too. Those crayons are very durable. She throws them around, bites them and so far none of the crayons broke. Great product."

140,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,2/2,5.0,"I love this stuff! I use it every day and it doesn't dry out my extra sensitive skin. I also use it to clean my shower which I wasn't planning on when I ordered it, but it does a fabulous job. Dr. Bronner's Castile soaps are great, especially if you have sensitive skin that easily breaks out in rashes or it irritated by soaps/laundry detergents/etc."
141,Earth Mama Angel Baby Booby Tubes,0/0,5.0,"I ordered these when I had my first bout of mastitis. With such good reviews, I thought, ""why not""? I'm glad I found these! Last week I had yet another plugged duct on its way to being mastitis. I used these- warm/hot before and during the pumping session (if breastfeeding, then just before) and a cold one afterwards to decrease the swelling. It worked. I am now plugged duct free... For now. I'm now taking Lecithin to ""hopefully"" help the duct problem. But if it doesn't, I can rely on my booby tubes."
142,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,4.0,"We use Dr. Bronner's soaps for everything- diluted for our bodies and hair in the shower, dishes, cleaning most surfaces. A little bit goes a long way with this product, and it smells lovely. When it is used around the house, everything smells minty fresh.The only drawback to this purchase was - when it arrived it had spilled ALL over the box! There was only about a quarter of the contents left in the bottle. It was so sad! But, we contacted Amazon, and they did right by us. I'm sure that they will adjust their packaging standards for this item in the future, so it is totally worth the investment!"
143,Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Strap,1/1,5.0,I use these playing tennis after 2 knee surgeries and they allow me to play without problems. Gives great support.
144,Preserved Black Beans with Ginger,1/1,5.0,My wife used these beans to make an excellent gluten-free black bean paste! She was very satisfied with the quality and taste.
145,Apex Apex Ultra Pill Splitter,0/1,4.0,I reccomend this to others as it works pretty well. The only thing is that it dose not split pills right down teh center. I think it would be too hard to try and design one that split every pill perfectly
146,HeroQuest Game System,0/0,5.0,Great game. With imagination you can go far and have a lot of fun. Long time wishing for this game.
147,Organix,1/1,5.0,"Let me start off by saying the scent I used is not listed and it is the Moroccan Argan Oil.My hair is coarse in places, smooth in others, and very oily, no matter what I do, it stays oily. Not only that, but other hair products make my head itch. When I say itch, I mean itch! I about can't stand my own head it will itch so bad. Even hair products designed to stop itch do not work on my scalp! As a last effort before I went crazy I had bought a set of Organix- the Moroccan Argan Oil. Since this review is just for the conditioner, I'll stick with my thoughts on it.Paired with the shampoo, it really makes such a difference in my hair and scalp! This set has almost completely stopped my itching. Not only that, but my hair is not as oily and it feels very, very soft. This is coming from someone who dyes their hair religiously. I love that when my hair moves, no lie, it almost looks like a TV ad. My hair is so soft, so shiny, and healthy looking.The conditioner isn't a 'to die for' smell, it smells good and that's what counts. It is a product that you have to use a little bit more than you would with other conditioners. Otherwise I feel it doesn't cover my head well enough and I have chin length hair. What you have to remember is that you have to wait 3 to 5 minutes before you wash this conditioner off. When I rinse, my hair is very soft, even when wet.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product. I do have to say this is the best hair product I have ever used and I love it very, very, very much."
148,Fat Cat Kitty Hoots Big Mama's Scratchy Box Double Wide Purple,1/1,5.0,"Like other reviewers, I was skeptical about a piece of cardboard, but I ordered this based on the reviews. I have two cats who completely ignore traditional cat scratchers in favor of furniture and carpets, no matter how much catnip I use as a distraction. However, for some reason, they LOVE this thing.I bought one 6 months ago. My girl only scratched it, but the boy also took to sleeping on it. Out of the blue recently, the girl is now sleeping on it and they are fighting for possession of it as I write, so now I'm back to buy another. I don't think I've ever refilled the catnip in the 6 months and they still go crazy for it. It's a little worse for the wear after all this time, but that doesn't seem to bother my fatties. It's the best ten bucks I've spent on them.The size is good too -- my cats are certainly double-wide themselves so they can fit (albeit barely) on it for a nap."
149,Swimmer's Normalizing Shampoo for Active Lifestyles 16oz,1/1,5.0,"I bought this because I was concerned about dangerous chemicals in ""regular"" shampoo products.The product itself does a wonderful job, and I feel safe using it.I even use it with my young son, and he has no complaints."
150,ThinkFun 4 Children's Card Games,0/0,4.0,"Great set for family fun. Our three yr-old grand twins mastered the Old Maid game in no time, moving on to Rummy now. However. when the card set (4) arrived it lacked the Crazy Eight game; two Rummy decks were present instead, plus the Old Maid game and Hearts game. Still it was a good deal."
151,Inis Energy of the Sea Cologne Spray,0/0,3.0,"I was so excited to receive this Inis perfume, which I bought exclusively based on the rave reviews I saw here.Unfortunately, it isn't for me. It indeed smells very fresh and clean as other reviewers describe, however it's too heavily citrus for me and smells like a cross between the ""Coast"" and ""Irish Spring"" soaps marketed here in the U.S. Actually, I might prefer the smell of those as they are less citrus! The citrus note gets stronger the longer you have it on, too.I agree that the scent is androgenous, could definitely work for either a man or a woman. If anything, it's maybe more on the man side, but just a tad.Scent is a very individual thing, so reviews aren't the most reliable in this category. It may be the right scent for you, it just wasn't for me."
152,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I saw this nail polish on a blog and I knew I had to get it so I came to Amazon and yes they had it. It is such a fun color it's bright and so fun for the summer or for nail art. Fast shipping and great packing and such a great color you will fall in love with it.
153,House - Mugicha (Barley) Tea - 16 large bags,0/0,5.0,I bought this tea to drink it cold or warm. Because is summer I drink it cold. I leave the bag tea in the water in the fridge over the night. In the morning I drink it with coconut milk. It fills me up for a while. I do not know how Japanese people are drinking this tea but it is very nutritional.
154,Marina Nutrafin Nutramatic 2X Fish Food Feeder,0/0,1.0,"We had to move to a temporary home due to mold restoration and bought this so we wouldn't have to go back and forth, but it releases way too much fish food! It didn't work out for us, so unless you have a 100 gallon tank, it probably won't work. Save your money."
155,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,The bed was easy to assemble and seems pretty solidly built. Our dog had previously been laying on the tiled floor in the bathroom to keep cool at night. After we gave him this he climbed up onto it and slept like a rock. Money well spent.
156,Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,0/0,5.0,This has been a lifesaver for us. It's lightweight easy to use and so practical. We have a Chicco keyfit 30 and it's a perfect fit. You can transfer baby and not wake them up which is so nice in the beginning. We are switching to stage 2 car seat next week and I'm so sad because I will have to give up my Snap n go.
157,Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,4/5,1.0,"I bought this product and after a couple of weeks when I used it maybe for the 10th time, the mechanism got broken. Never hepent this in a Burberry Brit and is the 5th time when I buy same one. I onestly doubt on quality for this seller"
158,Step2 Push Around Buggy (Red),0/0,5.0,I bought this for my grandon's 1st birthday. He LOVES it and so does my daughter and son in law. It is so cute and made very well. He looks so adorable steering it as they push him in it. It has seat belt so he is securely in the buggy. I would highly recommend it.
159,"Sanyo 1,000 mAh AAA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries 4-Pack",0/0,5.0,"These uniquely support the very high discharge rate needed to fully power my Fenix LD01 flashlight on high.As good as the eneloop AAAs are, and they are better for resisting self-discharge for low discharge rate applications like remote controls, mice, etc, they won't support the high discharge rate that kills them in under an hour when producing 80 Lumens in an LED flashlight. Instead, the current is restricted down to nearly the MED setting.These 1000 mAh batteries will provide full power, and they'll almost double the run-time duration of many bicycle lights. They do self-discharge though, at least more so than the eneloop cells, so if you use something rarely, go with the eneloops.I carry these as my installed batteries, with 2 more carried as spares, and one eneloop cell to make 3. This has proven to be a 100% reliable system.These 1000mAh cells are truly spectacular performers."
160,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,0/0,1.0,"My Walmart generic pet fountain burned out after a year, so I thought I'd upgrade to this more expensive model bought at Petco. More expensive must be better, right? After reading that the fountain, including the motor, is supposed to be disassembled and cleaned weekly I was hesitant. And the plastic fountain didn't seem any different or better built than the cheaper fountain. After the first cleaning, the Drinkwell leaked and was un-usable. I'll just buy a cheaper but more reliable version from Walmart, and the Drinkwell will go in the garbage."
161,"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Pearl, .15-Ounces (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,"In the tube the Siren shade looks very orange, but once applied it is more of a nice orange-ish coral. It's very flattering for pale skin."
162,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,1/1,1.0,"This product used to work, but this go around was useless on six cats. Even treated the house, and the cats are still scratching away. Not sure what the problem is with this product now. If I'm going to spend money on a flea product, I want it to work, and this stiff is not that cheap. Sometimes you DO get what you pay for. I will be going back to purchasing Revolution at my vets. I would rather spend more money for a better quality product."
163,DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,0/0,5.0,Was surprised at all the bad reviews. Got this sound machine about 2 weeks after the baby came home and now 3 months later it's turned into a MUST have. Just logged on to buy a second for the grandparents house since he will be over there more when I go back to work.
164,ADC Taylor Neuro Hammer,0/0,5.0,Bought this for my physical diagnosis class. Works just as advertised and I wouldn't expect otherwise. Don't know how you could mess this one up.
165,"Eden Organic Black Soy Beans, No Salt Added, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Call me old. I never thought the day would come when I would buy groceries online. Well, friends, the day has arrived because my local store sells out of these Eden Organic Black Soy Beans just about every time we buy them to make chili. So, I now have a case of them!!! Take that, Giant Eagle!!! :) ... I now have a new (cheaper) source for this product, for coffee pods, and a lot of the non-perishable products that I routinely buy. Thanks, Amazon, for saving me time and frustration... and MONEY!"
166,Savon de Marseille Olive-600g,1/1,5.0,Hundreds of years of experience goes into making this stuff. It's perfect soap. I cut the cube into 6 big bars with a meat cleaver.
167,Nylabone Durable Dental Dinosaur Chew Toy (Dinosaur Varies),0/0,5.0,My dog loves this little dinosaur!! I'm going to buy more in different shapes too :) I def recommend this! He's a tough chewer and this lasted a long time.
168,Zoya Nail Polish,3/4,3.0,"I bought a bottle of Farah in the spring and used it once. It's now August and I opened it again and it's thick and syrupy - as if its been sitting around for years. Application was sticky and awful. It bubbled when it dried. I'm disappointed Zoya, because you do make a lot of fantastic colors, but there are lots of other companies out there doing safer polishes in just as many fun colors...Butter London, Anthropologie, Deborah Lippman, Essie...we have more choices now so I'm officially off the zoya bandwagon."
169,Burberry Touch Eau de Parfum for Women by Burberry,0/0,4.0,I like that bottle it came in. The bottle was small abd come in a spray container which is imoportant wen trying on a new scent. but not the right scent for me.
170,"Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, Black",0/0,5.0,I certainly was in great need of a new curling iron and this one works great. It ismuch better than the one I replaced.
171,"Source Naturals Relora, 250mg",1/1,3.0,"Not real sure if these work as they are supposed to or it could be that i take so much other meds that i was unable to tell i was taking them. I thought at first that they were working but now , not so sure. It is supposed to help with weight loss, didn't. I took it about 3 months..."
172,Nutri-Vet K-9 Buffered Aspirin Chewables Liver -- 120 mg - 100 Chewables,3/3,5.0,We have bought the K-9 Buffered Aspirin many times. We have a dog with arthritis and this helps him so much!! I am so pleased that it is buffered as well because I don't want this upsetting our dogs stomach since he takes it so often.
173,Six Drug (THC/Coc/Opi/Amph/Mamph/Benzo) Dip Test (2 tests kits),1/1,5.0,This Six Drug Dip Test works great! Picked up the positives without a hitch. I ordered 10 test kits. Stuck the dip sticks in too far the first time so that was a waste but figured out quickly how to use the rest of them. Tested positive and negative in exactly the right categories. About to order more!
174,"Dynarex Gauze Sponges, N/S, Pouch/200",0/0,5.0,"I use these primarily for my horses. They are great for everything! Big wounds, small wounds, applicator for medicine, or padding. Work great for everything!"
175,JOHN VARVATOS For Men By JOHN VARVATOS Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"This is my first JV buy and so I was not sure what to expect. This fragrance is devine, not too strong and lasts very long on my skin. The packaging is the cherry on top. It has a different, warm and feel good effect."
176,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,5.0,"I purchased both the 10th and 11th doctor sonics, so am reviewing both and comparing where warranted."
177,"Altoids Curiously Strong Mints, Cinnamon, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I was in the check-out lane at Publix today when I realized that I forgot to get peppermints like I had planned to. I didn't want to put everything back in the cart and get out of line, so grabbed these. Wow! I'm sold. They're too intense for me to eat more than 1 at a time, so that will make them last awhile. No more gum or peppermint buying for me!"
178,Soft Focus All-Over Face Color,0/0,5.0,"I have been using the Bare Escentuals all over face color for some time and love it.Very easy to use, takes very little time to put my makeup on and that's important to me."
179,Ice Bandana (TM) - Blue/Black - TWO (2) PACK,0/0,2.0,"The ice packs don't last very long. I bought extra ice packs, but I had no idea that I'd have to exchange them so many times to keep cool. If you only have two, or even four, you'll be waiting for them to freeze. I bought 10. I have MS and keeping cool is important. I have a few of those neck wraps that swell up when you soak them in water. Those actually work better and stay cool longer. I also found it to be rather large. It's a better fit for a man with a larger neck. Not so much a woman because you'll have to wear it as a loose fitting necklace. I found that I need to hang on to the knot/tie so that the ice pack actually touches the back of my neck. Other than the thickness, you barely know it's there if you don't. Definitely better for indoor use. Outside in very hot, over 95 degree weather, not so much."
180,GE Animation Sonic X,0/0,5.0,Very nice item!! Very thick and well made. Glad I bought this one instead of the other one i was debating on.
181,Dr. Scholl's Foot Cream Ultra Overnight For Her 3.5 oz. Tube,0/0,5.0,"So, I had abused my heels with wearing flip flops, going barefoot around the house and we used to have Berber carpeting, so I think the constant scratching of the abrasive Berber didn't do my feet any favors. I had tried everything. I also hate wearing socks and shoes and don't want to wear socks at night either. I had dry heels and cracks were appearing everywhere on both feet. I tried a pumice stone and typical lotions, without any results. I was concerned enough to not want to have it continue, otherwise I'd need an appointment with a podiatrist.I had read that urea was helpful for dry, rough heels and this product contains urea, amongst others. I used this product morning after my shower after drying my feet well. Then at night, hit or miss, before bedtime as well. It took about 3 weeks of use, but now my heels look fantastic and healthy. All the dryness is gone! The cracks are almost all totally healed as well.I used the Mr Pumice (purple bar) gently under running water with gentle cleanser, then dried my feet well and applied the Dr. Scholls to my heels. Voila!I'll never be without this product again. Give it time. I'm sure if you do the nighttime routine w/socks, it may work faster for you.One cannot afford to get infections, so by keeping your heels healthy, it equates to overall health and might save you a trip to the doc."
182,"Dr. Scholl's Odor Destroyers Sport Spray, 4.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,This product works very well! My feet become very stinky & offensive in the HIGH Heat of the summer. This takes care of the problem. And no more complaints from family about those darn stinky feet. Thank You!!
183,Four Paws Kitty Curry Brush for Cats,0/0,2.0,"I purchased this brush based on the reviews. Unfortunately, I did not find that it did a good job of removing hair even if I brushed against the hair growth first, then with the hair growth. My kitten is a short haired tabby, but it does very little in gathering hair. I found the fine wire brush did a better job, though I will say she enjoys this brush better--sort of like a massage."
184,"Nutri-Vet Shed Defense Chewables with Omegas for Dogs, 60ct",0/0,4.0,"My little poodle was chewing sores in her skin. I tried shampoos and topical medicines, all of which helped for a few hours. I tried this product and she's healing up rapidly."
185,Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Pads,0/0,5.0,"I'm a 19 male, with dry skin and slight rosacea.This product is super gentle, even for a mild acid peel. I can use it everyday, it's incredibly friendly on my dehydrated skin. This stuff made my skin look so bright and healthy, that I will continue to purchase over and over. If you are looking for a brighter complexion, or just a more even skintone this will impress you. Very few products receive a 5 from me, but philosophy sure earned it. LOVE!"
186,Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap,2/2,5.0,"I must say I am amazed by how well the Tea Tree wash has improved my toe fungus. I got toe fungus from the injury, more than 20 years ago; I have tried many products and by far this product works the best!"
187,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,1.0,"We purchased this item to stop our 25-pound beagle from pulling on walks. She absolutely would not accept a gentle leader, so this was suggested as an alternative. PetCo and PetSmart don't stock this size, so I ordered it from Amazon.Poor little Jessie - one walk, and it rubbed under her front legs raw. After she heeled, I made a fleece pad for it to try to stop the rubbing. Despite the fleece, she was still red under her legs (the area I would consider an ""armpit"" if she was a human) after a walk. Needless to say, we gave up at that point.I wish there was an altenative to a gentle leader to help her walk better on a leash, but this definitely is not it."
188,"Joseph's Lite Cookies Sugar Free Peanut Butter Cookies, 11 oz.",0/0,1.0,"Honestly... is it so hard to make a sugar free cookie that tastes good with all the sugar alternatives available in this day and age?I literally had to spit this out it was so awful. Just unreasonably bad.It was dry, hard, bitter, stale tasting, and nothing like peanut butter.I enjoy eating spinach more than these cookies.5 bucks I'll never get back."
189,Flexrake 1-Story US Cats Condo 1024,2/2,1.0,"Day 1, I was pleased with the product until I saw it shedding everywhere. By day 5, most of my floor was covered in tufts from the kitty condo. The staples started coming out from inside and I would have to inspect daily so that my cat wouldn't die from ingesting staples. Three weeks later, the top started falling, and now the kitty condo has no top. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who cares about their pet."
190,OPI Classics Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,Elephantastic pink was the first color that got my attention from the India collection by OPI and I am so glad I bought it. It is a perfect bright pink. But with my skin being more tan it is hard to find one that isn't too much. Its a subtle brightness and the application is so smooth. This is the pink I have been wanting all summer and I am ecstatic that I now own it. You MUST get this color if you don't already have it!!!
191,Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash,1/1,1.0,"This was such a rip off product. After a couple of months of use, the exfoliating beads disappeared and it was just liquid. Now it's useless. The entire time I was using this, the pop up lid kept getting clogged and I had to unscrew the top to get the product out. Will not buy this again. Save your money and avoid frustration by finding another product."
192,Koolatron Electronic Pet Flea Zapping Comb,2/2,1.0,"This is one of the worst products I have ever bought, perhaps the worst in the world and it wasn't cheap either. I guess Amazon realized that and dropped their price $12 less after I bought it. The review about how you can't even comb with this because of the design is absolutely correct (beads at the end of each tooth), it just makes the thing slide over your dog's hair. Absolutely useless. Save your money, buy anything else but this."
193,Aquatic Dog Life Jacket,0/0,4.0,"My dog enjoys to swim but this jacket makes me feel secure that he wont get tired too quick. I would like a little extra buoyancy to keep his head a little higher, but I love the buckle straps on the jacket."
194,Flexi Comfort 2 Medium Retractable Cord Dog Leash - Blue w/Black,0/0,5.0,Very easy to use. Just need to be careful when the line gets wrapped around yourself. The handle is plenty big enough for my whole hand.
195,Nature's Way Olive Leaf,10/11,4.0,I have hit that time in my life (early 40's) where I know I must start taking better care of myself. For me the formula was
196,Himalaya Liver Care,24/27,5.0,"Earlier this year, I went in for a routine physical and discovered my liver enzymes were all out of whack. My father died during a failed liver transplant and although his problems didn't stem from drinking alcohol I am pretty self-conscious about drinking too much and damaging my liver.After doing some research on my own and talking to my M.D., I began a regiment of LiverCare supplemented with TUDCA and Milk Thistle,TUDCA Powder (Tauroursodeoxycholic) 25 Grams + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams.I have been taking this for the past three months, and just got new liver tests. I am in the normal range again! My ALT was 59 and now it is down to 45. I attribute this to the fact I have been taking these supplements for the past three months now and to be honest I have not done much to cut back on my drinking. Needless to say, I will continue to take these supplements."
197,"Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani, 1.7 oz Eau De Toilette Spray for women",0/0,5.0,"I love this scent on my husband. It's light, lingering and sexy. Not at all overpowering. I've always purchased it at the mall or, every once in a while, at the airport between flights. Either way, I would definitely recommend the fragrance. Great for day time and night time."
198,Corolle Les Classiques Doll Accessories (Floral Print Umbrella Stroller),0/0,4.0,"My daughter has used this stroller for several years with her dolls. The wheels, fabric, and frame have held up well although the stroller never seemed to fold up properly even when new. It's fine for pushing/carrying dolls and accessories and will take normal wear and tear but the frame will bend if an overzealous sibling decides to sit in it, as expected. Not a bad stroller."
199,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"For Audrey is an absolutely gorgeous color! It does look very much like the Tiffany blue and works on most skin tones. The fact that it's China Glaze just makes it better, all my China Glaze polishes go on very smoothly and last for over a week without chipping when I use a top coat. I highly recommend the color and the brand."
200,Extra Large Crutch Tips,1/1,1.0,"These tips didn't even last me a month. They're a very soft grade of rubber and just didn't hold up to any sort of standard use, much less extended use. I would avoid them."
201,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I had a professional pedicure with this China Glaze Tempest color and loved it so much, I began the hunt to find my own. This is it. The perf shimmery shade somewhere between cobalt blue & deep periwinkle. I LOVE IT!"
202,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"For Audrey is an absolutely gorgeous color! It does look very much like the Tiffany blue and works on most skin tones. The fact that it's China Glaze just makes it better, all my China Glaze polishes go on very smoothly and last for over a week without chipping when I use a top coat. I highly recommend the color and the brand."
203,Booda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop,0/0,1.0,Worked well but broke easily. This happened after 4 weeks of usage. 3 of the tines cracked near the front end of the scooper.
204,"World's Best 00098 Cat Litter, Clumping Formula",0/0,4.0,"So... World's Best Cat Litter probably doesn't live up to the brand name. I liked the fact that it was corn and ""natural"" so the dust that is inhaled by me and the cats isn't full of chemicals. However, my cats' first reaction to this litter was the same as other reviewers - a temptation to eat it. One cat kept trying to chew thru the bag to get to it. Initially, the same cat wouldn't even cover his eliminations - because he didn't like the feel against his feet? It's hard to know. In any case, I did mix the finer Cat's Pride (which seems to be the first choice for the cats) with World's Best and it seems to be doing an adequate job. I don't know what I continue to torture my boys through various cat litters when they are happiest with Cat's Pride but I am still trying to find a ""healthier"" solution. So, I tried Dr. Elsey's Precious and wrote a review of that and that's definitely off the list and I'm not sold on World's Best so I will try SwheatScoop next. I've heard lots of good things about it but will probably always mix it with Cat's Pride. Cat's Pride seems to make my cats the happiest - they like the texture and it has great odor absorbing qualities - and I am reluctant to let them have it because it contains sodium bentonite. In any case, I wouldn't give World's Best 5 stars - I'll go 4 because it clumps well, doesn't seem to smell but the cats don't love it."
205,P & G/ Duracell 28987 6V Photo Electronic Battery,0/0,5.0,Exactly the battery we needed for our invisible fence dog collar. We had trouble finding it last time - had to go to a battery speciality store and paid 3 times as much. Thanks Amazon!
206,"Sherpa 11721 Delta Pet Carrier, Medium, Black",1/1,5.0,"Great carrier. We are pleased with it. We have two Ragdoll cats. We had car trouble and only had this carrier with. We were forced to put the two into this carrier. Because of the size the two did fit into it. I would not want to use it that way all the time, but in a pinch it did work because of the size and design. It has a lot of openings and the pet is easy to put in. It carries well on your shoulder. Basically I am pleased with the product. I also find that when we travel and leave the front open, one will sometimes go in and just sleep. They must find it comfortable also."
207,Malibu Swimmers Wellness Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"We bought this for my daughter who was swimming every day...it has helped with tangles and the bad look chlorine can leave. I typically put it in her hair and let it soak for about 5 minutes and then we use regular conditioner. It would probably work even better if we used the Malibu conditioner, but we opted to try it without the Malibu kind initially to see if it worked OK (it did!). We will likely use this for many years to come!"
208,StarMark Clicker Dog Training System,0/0,5.0,"This is a really nice clicker! It shipped very fast- I got it on the date it was scheduled to come. The sound is loud, clear, and easy for dogs to hear. My dog can hear it, and she doesn't have great hearing ability. This clicker is worth exactly the price it was paid for. I think this is the best clicker out there!"
209,Solvit 62313 Waterproof Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,5.0,"After destroying many back seats with spilled juice, snacks and claw marks from my dog I decided to get a seat cover. Easy to install and fits perfectly. Accommodates both car seats and looks like new after a trip to the washing machine. Highly recommend."
210,Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,"The Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush is an excellent product. The sonic vibrating movement of the bristles feel like they do a thorough job.After a year the battery refused to hold a charge for more than one two-minute session and eventually died all together. I called Philips and they sent me a replacement quickly and hassle free. Due Philip's customer service, I can confidently recommend this product."
211,Grannick Bitter Apple Spray with Dabber Top for Dogs 8oz,1/1,5.0,"This totally deters my puppy from chewing. I've seen him try chewing something then turn around and walk away once he's tasted it. You do have to reapply every few days as I understand the effects wear off. Unfortunately, I did not reapply to my baseboards and he did get to them. I've also been told you shouldn't put it on everything as it may lose its effect, just those specific items that the pup is prone to chew on."
212,Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel - Peach Pink,0/0,5.0,"WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!It's an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL ""scrubbing"" propensity to ""sloth"" away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling ""invigorated"" after every shower or bath.They produce copious amounts of foam with small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package's front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, ""spent"" cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This ""recycling"" act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.IT'S GREAT!! (especially if you're really dirty and don't have sensitive skin!!)"
213,Ocean Wonders Seahorse Rattle,0/0,5.0,"I got this a few months ago, and my daughter thought it was ok. She is 7 months old now and we don't leave the house without it. She likes her toys, but this one and a couple others, I will be in trouble if it gets lost. Easy for her to grab, shake, play with. I'm not sure about educational value, but it does have the little rings that help her to grasp smaller things. Bright and cheery."
214,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,0/0,3.0,"We order this, the original diaper champ, because we were told by almost everyone that the original is great but the new, ""deluxe"" is awful. So, we put this, the original, on our registry. The company that fulfilled the order is called Babyhaven. They sent us the deluxe, which is not what we ordered. We sent them a screenshot proving to them that what we ordered on our registry was the original, so they agreed to refund the person who purchased it for us the money, but said that we have to pay shipping. That seemed ridiculous, since it is their fault for advertising that they're selling the original but sending out the crappy deluxe. We eventually worked it out with Amazon, getting some Amazon credits in exchange for having to pay shipping to BabyHaven, but only after some phone calls and big hassle. So"
215,Munchkin Deluxe Baby Food Organizer,0/0,3.0,"This definitely saves space, but definitely has plenty of room for improvement... starting with the how whenever you turn it if it isn't just so it falls to the lower level. I checked the notches and still happens. You can't really story anything out of the classic jars. There is no room for pouches and sitting the rectangular Gerber foods is awkward. Overall the product is convenient, but only just."
216,California Exotics Veined Double Dildo,0/0,3.0,My friend and I picked this up for some fun... it's a little smaller than we expected and it has a very strong plastic smell that we can't seem to get rid of... it works well but yeah it's a bit small

218,Vitamin C Crystals Ascorbic Acid 100% Pure Powder,3/4,4.0,"Hello friends!! I am writing a review which I rarely do even though I buy on Amazon quite a bit. Currently I am on day 29 0f 40 Day Water Fast!! This is by far the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life!!! The reason I say that is because of the long list of detox symptoms that come along with it, the worst one being absolutely NO ENERGY to do even the simplest tasks. I have done Vitamin C Flushes in the past and decided that this would be a great time to incorporate it into my water detox fast. It worked out perfectly! During the fast I have done a total of 11 days of Vitamin C flushes and have seen MASS amounts of built up mucus and toxins just pour out of my Lymphatic system!!! So often society is guided into thinking that ""changing your diet and exercise"" will net you a healthier life. While that may be ""half"" true, we forget that when we lived a TOXIC LIFESTYLE, that all of the toxins that we have ingested are permanently lodged inside of our tissues. We have to flush these out by some sort of means and it is by my personal experience that I believe that long water fasts and vitamin c flushes are the only way. The first couple of flushes netted me thick pasty like mucus out of the rectum. As I continued the flushes, I noticed less and less mucus that resembled more of a ""shrapnel"" consistency. This product definitely works if you are in the market for purchasing it for the purpose of Vitamin C Flushes. I should have bought a smaller jar as I do not see myself needing the product for the remanding duration of the fast. I would have given it five stars but the only thing I didn't like about it is the unpredictability of passing a mucus flush after it is ingested which can last for up to two days, but all Ascorbic Acid does that."
219,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Salty,0/0,4.0,These trains are a source of delight and endless hours of play for my grandson who is nearly 3. The trains are well made and withstand tough treatment and long hours of play. The prices are very reasonable and the selection is much better than in the retail stores. Extra fast shipping and processing put the toy in his hands almost immediately. The colors withstand frequent baths and rainshowers as well as the blistering sun of Alabama and don't fade. A quality set of train toys for young children.Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Salty Engine
220,Organix,0/0,1.0,"I bought this product awhile back and I have only used the shampoo and it was ok so then I thought ""Let's try the conditioner!"". Boy, do I wish I kept the receipt! This conditioner practically caused an apocalypse in my hair! It was matted, tangled, it was horrific. I had to wash my hair with different shampoo and conditioner to ease my hair enough for me to even pull it apart! Thank God I have thick hair otherwise, I would of just looked like I had bald spots after the whole thing! It took two of us to get my hair decent again to where we could manage it! I couldn't believe how bad it was, I almost cut off all my hair because of this!. Never again will I buy any of their products!"

223,BeautyBlender Sponge,1/1,5.0,"OK, that's a little dramatic but I'm seriously thinking about ordering one for all of my friends so I can spread the joy. For years I used a brush to apply my foundation (Make Up For Ever HD) and that worked well until I started using Atralin (Retin A). All the lovely (read excruciatingly annoying) flaking that comes with Retin A made using a brush impossible because it encouraged more flaking. So I switched to a powered foundation (still Make Up For Ever HD) and applied it with a stippling brush. That worked well but I craved more coverage. More research ensued and I found this amazing product.My new and highly rewarding foundation routine"

228,"Kershaw Knives Bread Knife, 8 in., Clam Packed",2/2,5.0,"I am a banquet cook at a large resort and frequently have to do tedious things like slice 2000 slider buns or cut 1000 tomato slices. Everyone who has borrowed this knife in the kitchen comes back to me and asks where I got it. It's simply fantastic. The knife is light, the grip is excellent, and the blade is thin, which are all things you want out of your bread knife. Definitely keeps you going long after the guy with his 4 pound club has gotten fatigued. Would recommend to home cooks and chefs alike."
229,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"These diapers are great! They arrived very quickly, and my daughter has had no rashes or irritations from them. Will definitely buy again."
230,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,This color is stunning for the summer; equally beautiful on fair and olive skin tones. The only complaint is the makeup of the polish causes the first coat to be very streaky and chalky. The second coat will smooth it out beautifully and a top coat will literally seal the deal. I had one manicurist apply it really well and another one who did a terrible job. Just depends on the technician doing your nails.
231,"Orly Nail Lacquer, 06 Fluid Ounce",1/1,2.0,This fingernails polish arrived in a timely manner and in good order. The color is very pretty but it doesn't go on well and doesn't smooth out. No matter what I did I had globby brush strokes. My last attempt to salvage the product was to use polish thinner but this didn't work either. I ended up thtowing it out. I don't recommend this product.
232,Guidecraft Safari Collection Table And Chairs Set,0/1,5.0,"I love this adorable set. It looks wonderful and you can even buy mathching pieces. This is something I am proud to own and look forward to keeping it around for years and then passing on to my grandkids! It feels sturdy enough for me to sit down too with my 3 year old son.We scratched a chair leg almost instantly and when I emailed Guidecraft about touchup paint, they sent me a brand new leg free of charge. WOW that's customer service!"
233,Haba Six Wooden Eggs in a Carton - Wooden Play Food,0/0,5.0,"These are a great addition to a playroom kitchen set. My grandkids love all of these wooden food sets. These are a bit more for older girls and boys because to a little one they could be a ""missle"". You will like these."

I loved how i could hold my baby safely by my chest while having my arms free to do things. Another plus was that I could comfortably breastfeed him and no one could tell what I was doing. Great product!=)"

Item is as pictured, rather than as described. They aren't as big or as nice as I had imagined for the price. Not bad, but just a little disappointing all the way around. I'll probably return them."
238,"Pero Instant Natural Beverage, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)",1/1,5.0,"I love this product. Pero is so satisfying and full bodied, richer than a cup of coffee with no caffeine.

It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more. Then, I saw an ad on TV for a competing product, but found these to be a better deal. They are worth every penny.The Teenie Greenies arrived yesterday. Just ONE solved the problem. I gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up. Instead, she loved it. This morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles. I instinctively cringed, waiting for that fetid smell. But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada."

242,Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate,0/0,5.0,"Three months ago we installedDreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, Whitein our house. Much easier to install than the direction booklet made it seem. It can be drilled into the doorway, you can use the self-sticking tape that comes with it, or you can rely solely on tension. It closes automatically. Sometimes it does not click shut completely; it makes noise when shut properly. Once shut, no child will be able to open it and cats don't jump it (we have three cats)."
243,BRIGHT CRYSTAL For Women By GIANNI VERSACE,4/5,1.0,"I bought this product in hopes of a better price, but what I got was a waste of money. I got something different than I ordered plus what they are showing as the product picture is not what they are selling or sending. It smells like a knock off that you would buy at a swap meet/flea market and doesn't last long like the real thing. Please do not waste your time or your money. You are better spending a little more to get a quality long lasting product."
244,"Luna Bars, 1.69-Ounce Bars",1/1,5.0,I really like the Lemon Zest flavor- At first I thought it was a little too sweet but it grows on you.. On days I am craving someone sweet I will open one and snack on it throughout the day- keeps my cravings under control.. Excited to try other flavors!
245,The First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer,1/1,5.0,"This bottle warmer is really great and works a lot faster than running warm water on the bottle from the faucet. It leaves me enough time to change my baby's diaper before feedings and has an indicator light that turns off when the bottle is ready. I use this bottle warmer withPhilips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottles, 5-Packand they fit perfectly. Other reviewers on here are probably not using the measuring tube correctly when putting water in the machine. I usually fill it to the 7 line and the bottles are always just right. I highly recommend this product as a new parent because it is quick and convenient."
246,DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit,0/0,4.0,"One of the bolts was just a touch difficult to get in place, but once that was done, the transformation of the crib into a beautiful bed was complete. Honestly, our son's bed is now nicer than our own bed, no joke. The only reason I did not give 5 starts was the difficulty of putting the one bolt in place, which I read that some other people had similar difficulty."

248,"Clipper guide comb, fits Oster, Wahl, Andis etc. 1.25.",0/1,2.0,"I was excited to get this comb, as I've been cutting my own hair for 3+ years now. The 1"" comb I currently have is a bit short, so I thought the 1.25"" would be a better length. I read the reviews of the wahl 1.25"" comb and didn't like how the comb had only 5 tongs (too much space=choppy cuts). Anyway, got this guy and put it on my wahl clippers (I'm in the process of upgrading to some nicer Andis or Osters). Two main problems. First, the comb slides side to side. Second, the comb tongs are thick at the base, so the cut is...let's just say inefficient. I'm now looking at buying the andis size F (1.25"") comb (check them out at the following linkAndis High Quality Plastic Universal Snap-On Large Pet Clipper Comb, Size F, 32mm).Mark 1:14-15 (NASB)Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,and saying, ""The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."""
249,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,4.0,"The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is the price. I don't know how much it could possibly cost to produce something as simple in design as this. This seems pricey. That said, it works great as a DE razor, holds the blade tightly without distortion, and cleans up easily. Does seem to transfer heat fairly efficiently to the handle, so if you like to shave in scalding hot water (I do not), you may burn your fingers.It is better than the 7 dollar plastic razor available on here. I started with that one. That one works, but does not hold the blade as well and is not near as solid."
250,Sound Spa Portable,2/2,5.0,"I have had this item on my wish list for years. I kept putting off getting it for so long. Finally, I got it and it came yesterday.It is very portable. Takes 4 AA batteries, which happily I happened to have sitting on my bedroom desk already. It also comes with an AC adaptor.The timer has 3 settings, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour. As the instructions state, if you want to listen to it continuously, you don't want to hit the timer button - otherwise you have to turn it off and back on.Speaking of the instructions, they are complete. Took about 3 minutes to read through and there's very little about this machine that is not intuitive to begin with.I got this for two reasons. First, I want the heartbeat sound for a Halloween effect. That way I wouldn't need to play a sound on my computer in a loop. I can just set this in the spot I want it heard. It's small and easily concealable.Second, I just wanted something nice to fall asleep to. Last night I set the timer to 1 hour and used the ocean sound. Worked like a charm.I brought it to work today and used it quietly at my desk. Co-workers are now considering getting their own too.So happy I finally got around to ordering this item!"

I probably keep several countries coffee production up, so I know coffee. I don't mind strong coffee or so so tasting coffee I just dont expect it to be expensive so so tasting coffee. I have had and love Jamaican Blue mountain coffee before but it was a lot more expensive than this. This came in a cute little burlap sack (you get some style points there) but after that it's pretty much down hill. The coffe is not the normal rich tasting wonderfull smelling JBM I have had before, it just tastes like every other coffee albeit at an extravagent price. I have ordered some more Blue mountain from another supplier will have to see how that goes. This is one that will not get any repeat business from me. There are plenty of other better tasting coffees out there at a lower price."
253,Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,1. Product is totally reliable 2. My dentist says teeth get much cleaner with electric toothbrushes and by the way he recommends Sonicare 3.

After the first one broke I contacted the company because before I bought it people who had reviewed the cots said the corner brackets break but they had good luck in getting new ones from the company. Well, I didn't. They wanted my item numbers and sales slip and all sorts of info that I didn't have so now I have 2 cots that I need to throw out because it was so hard to get the replacement parts. The cots are great when not broken but what good are they if they break and can't be repaired?"

I was disappointed at how flimsy this was when I opened the box. After having this for a week, my dog has almost shredded this thing.

261,Melissa & Doug Triangular Crayons - 24 pack,1/2,5.0,"Your right about the pigmintation being light when in use, but I stand up for this product. I have baught several crayola products and the quality of those product are just horrible. Many of those are shooved in plastic container broken and beat to hell. Milissa's and Dougs products came in a nice plastic case, easy for your todler to use and store. Crayola boxes may have a sharpner but the boxes fall apart and end up under your couch or todler bed. My daughter has a younger sibling now stealing her toys. My 1yr old has to eat eveything like a hoover. But Milissa's and Dougs product are the strongest in the market. Yes they can break, but not like the other product. My girls trample over everything. They just snap so smoothly when if broken. The other kind of shread and are jagged. Make the investment! My daughter does'nt really care if the colors are as bright as the sun at 2yrs. She just wants to scribble. This product will last through the todler stage! A+"

I am a happy camper. So is Tessa."
264,Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat,1/1,3.0,"I have both the Cooshee booster and this one and I have to say I like the Cooshee better. They're both good - they do the job of boostering the kid closer to their food, but the Cooshee has a smooth surface that was easy to clean. The Lionheart has a texture on the seat part (where food is most likely to be dropped) that has never come completely clean for me. I've used a scrub brush and BonAmi, but it still looks discolored. The Cooshee I can just wipe off with a rag and everything comes off. This is my only complaint with the Lionheart chair.My first child used the Cooshee and now my second child is using it. We've had no problems - and we have recently started taking it to plays/movies so she can see better."

Ideally I'd change all our carpets to hardwood, but...that's a much more expensive solution!"
268,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head,0/0,5.0,"Replacement brushes for my older Sonicare have been hard to find, and previously the site description here had an error. The error has now been fixed, and this is one of the very few sources for these brushes. I am happy about that, and that they come in sets of three. The brushes are very effective and fit the older model device."
269,NOW Foods Tea Tree Oil,3/3,4.0,"Despite the aroma of tea tree oil, which some people simply cannot tolerate, the health benefits of tea tree oil are well documented and they are many. This popular oil works against fungus, bacteria, and viruses. It is known to effectively fight a number of infections that are resistant to some antibiotics and is used by eczema and psoriasis sufferers.It is also used literally for hundreds of bacterial and fungal skin ailments such as acne, abscess, oily skin, blisters, sun burns, athlete's foot, warts, herpes, insect bites, rashes, dandruff and other minor wounds and irritations. The anti-viral properties of the oil fight many common infectious diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and measles, flu, cold sores and verrucae while improving the body's immune system.It is no wonder that tea tree oil, despite it's strong unfamiliar odor, is considered an essential oil.My experience with Now Foods Tea Tree Oil (16 ounce) is good. The oil is a high quality and works just as well as the medicinal quality 1 ounce bottles purchased from stores like Walgreens but the savings buying it in a 16 ounce quantity from Now Foods is obvious. The lid could be a bit better in my opinion and like another reviewer pointed out this doesn't come with a dropper. Because of the high quality of the oil, the decent savings, etc... I give this product four out of five stars."
270,American Health Super Acerola Plus,1/1,2.0,"I, too, used to buy these regularly at the health food store. Now somewhat older and wiser, I think I understand why the health food store stopped carrying this product. If you study the label carefully (which I never did before), I think you'll find it is rather misleading.Big picture of cherries and the word ""Acerola"" in big red print. The ingredients statement, however, isn't forthcoming. As best I can figure, you're getting in each tablet 500mg (1/2 gram) of vitamin C, and 2 grams of sugar. Since it doesn't say what kind of sugar, we must presume it's white, refined sugar. There may be as much as 530mg of Vit C in each tablet, but apparently only about 30mg of that is from natural sources. The bulk of it (probably almost 500mg -- can't be sure) is from ""ascorbic acid."" That is simply a laboratory chemical form of vitamin C.Bottom line"
271,Early-Detection Pregnancy Tests,0/0,5.0,It detected my pregnancy 1 week before my period. I did several of them to confirm and they all were positive. I am gonna buy some since we are trying to have another baby.
272,San Juan,0/0,4.0,"This game can be really fun. It is not as easy to get into as Dominion because a player needs to be fairly familar with all the cards in the deck so that appropriate stategies and decisions can be made.Play can vary greatly depending on how many people are playing. If 2 people are playing then the Library is a must build if you get it. And then if you get a Quarry... gg. On the other hand, if you can get Library, Smithy, Guild Hall then that is gg. If neither player gets either of those combos then you can have some fun games. With 3 to 4 players, the Library becomes less effective.For the price, I think this is a good game if you like playing games like Dominion, etc. The set up time is about 2 minutes and a 2-player game can be over in about 15-20mins which is a great advantage over games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid if you are short on time.The level of strategy versus luck in this game is definitely tilted in the favor of luck (unlike the above mentioned games). This can be frustrating at times if you are a big strategist but also allows those that are more casual gamers to feel superior to the hardcore gamer that gets some bad draws.All in all, this is a good game with a 3-4 game learning curve (to really know all the cards) but that can be done in less than one hour."
273,Ascorbic Acid Powder - 2.2 lbs - Powder,0/1,3.0,"I read on the Internet somewhere that ascorbic acid controls the iron stains in swimming pools, so I thought I'd try it. I used the entire package in one treatment and nothing happened. If you have a swimming pool then you know how irritating and expensive it is to constantly treat the horrible brown stains that appear on the underwater surfaces. The only effective thing I have found is a combination of Iron Out and Iron Myte. The trouble is, if you then fail to replace the water, or at least half of it, with iron-free water, the stains come right back within 24 hours. Although effective, each treatment with those products was costing me $30 each time, essentially every other day, until I was able to obtain iron-free water to drain and refill the pool. By the way, Iron Myte is much cheaper at Menards compared to Am......on. About 1/2 the price regularily. Also, I know that Iron Out is not recommended for swimming pools because it's an irritant. So use it sparingly , like inside a white athletic sock like an eraser, and don't use the pool for several hours."
274,Burberry Touch For Men,1/1,5.0,I was so happy when I found it on amazon for a great price. I would def buy another one when I run out again!

276,Hidden Kingdom Insects,0/0,2.0,The description made this seem like it would be outstanding and biologically correct. It is not. Over priced. I could get the same thing for cheaper at any toy store or box store.
277,"Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)",3/3,1.0,"Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)I have been eating this cereal every morning for many years. My last shipment was different in several ways. The flakes were thicker, tough and stuck in my teeth, and there was a gritty feel which gave me kind of a sore tongue. I contacted the cereal company online and they promised to make it right. Said the cereal had not changed its formula but during the period in question, there was a glitch and the flakes were rolled thinner. Didn't seem that to me, just the opposite, plus the taste was altered for the worse. They have sent me coupons to buy Nature's Path products, but no one around my small town carries it. I will use them, however, when I get to a larger city, 50 miles away. I then ordered the same cereal ""with raisins"" described as plump and juicy raisins, from a different on-line distributor. It's the same, except the raisins are like little hard rocks. We ground the first shipment up for the birds, but they won't eat it either."
278,Playtex 3 Pack Baby Drop-Ins Nurser,0/0,5.0,"i always scared to use this product. but, since my baby is 21 month old, she will be able to release any extra gas from all the air of this bottle liner. i've seen younger babies use this. i'm concern for colic. great for travels and yes the measurement is not accurate."
279,Gu GU Energy Gel- 24 Pack,0/0,5.0,"Gu is the perfect pick me up for long rides, long hikes, and right before a good work out. When I'm not hungry but need a boost, Gu does the trick. I've tried other similar products but Gu gel worked the best in terms of performance and digestion (no upset stomach). Packaging and delivery was also timely and of quality."
280,Ethical Pet Spotbrites Laser Pet Toy and Exerciser,0/0,1.0,"I read where batteries cost too much and I agreed but I spoil my cat and thought the butterfly etc shapes would be more fun for her..the shapes are not clear and mine was broken in that the tiny plastic nipple to press to turn on had fallen out..Im amazed I found it when I realized there was no button to press to turn it on. Now I have to return it..too much work for ; in fact I've put in more work ordering it, trying to fix the button and then repacking it and sending it back than they did to make it."
281,"Pegasus Hobbies 1/48 Snap, A6M2, 21 ""Zero"" PGH8409",0/0,3.0,"My son is just now getting into modeling, and I am starting him off on easy ones. This one was not as easy as I'd expect. There was no prepainting done so the model is a base off-white color with no detail. The parts do not fit together as well as I'd expect either. I do appreciate the fact the model can be made with gear up or down. I'd rate this as average."
282,"Threelac Probiotic Dietary Supplement, Natural Lemon Flavor, Includes 60 .053-Ounce Packets",2/2,5.0,"This probiotic is a life saver. It has helped both my husband and I tramendously in managing stomach issues. The only drawback is the powder form, which is not as user friendly a pill might be. It had such great reviews that we decided to get it nontheless and glad we did - it's definitely some powerful stuff. Highly recommend it!"
283,Bio Kleen All Purpose Clean Concentrate,0/0,5.0,Biokleen is the best cleaner available anywhere. It can be used on most any surface. I've been using it now for several years in my housecleaning business and best of all it's non-toxic! The price is great and I received it quickly. I was pruchasing it at my local PCC but they quit carrying it. So thank God my wonderful Amazon had it!!!
284,"Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade A Dark Amber, 32-Ounce Jug",0/0,5.0,"We try to keep our diet organic as best we can. This is one of the few organic maple syrups that I could find. Luckily, it is also one of the best tasting. For those who are still unaware that there is a HUGH difference between maple syrup and the ""maple flavored"" sugar c**p that lines the grocery store shelves, you owe it to yourself to try genuine maple syrup. To those who already appreciate maple syrup I highly recommend Coomb's."
285,Murad Fine to Thinning Hair Conditioner,0/0,2.0,The product description sets you up for high expectations but it really doesn't work... Shampooed daily and used the entire bottle... got better results with lower cost products.
286,Erector Motorized Racing Car & More - 643 pc Metal Construction Set,6/8,2.0,"We purchased this set for our son's birthday and were all very excited about building a model after supper. I told him to pick a model off of the back of the box and he selected the tow truck. Upon opening the box and the instruction manual, I was vey frustrated to see that it only contained instructions for ELEVEN models. The box clearly shows twenty-five. I was frustrated and my son was disappointed, but we selected another model and had a great time. The Erector Set website FAQs note that they do not include instructions for all models because they want kids to use their imagination. I think that is great, but engineering requires a basic set of skills before one can put one's imagination to work creating something greater. Overall, this is a fun toy, but my son was not blessed with a mechanical engineer for a father. I can follow instructions, but I don't yet know how to turn an erector set into a tow truck with moving parts. The packaging is misleading."
287,Petmate Kennel Cab Intm Moss Bank Coffee Grnds S,0/2,1.0,"Do Not Purchase.I bought this for my miniature schnauzer puppy, who currently weighs 6 pounds. This crate has a top and bottom that fasten together and a door that you can remove to switch the direction in which it opens. The crate is very flimsy and the top and bottom do not stay latched together. On several occasions the bottom has fallen out when I've been carrying the crate - once with my puppy in it (thankfully the puppy was fine). I keep checking the latches, and they seem secured, but the crate keeps falling apart! This morning, I was carrying the EMPTY crate down the stairs when the door fell off. I no longer carry the crate with my puppy in it because it's simply NOT safe. The plastic of the crate has too much give in it, causing it to sag and fall apart when lifted by the handle.The crate claims it meets International Air Transport Association requirements, but if I can't even carry it 20 yards to my car, how will it ever survive a plane trip?Maybe I got a defective crate, but I'm giving up on this one. I am headed to the pet store today to purchase a new, more secure crate.This one is going back."
288,PollenAid Flower Pollen Extract by Graminex - 90 Capsules,0/0,5.0,"My MD recommended this for me a couple years ago. Had chronic testiculitis for years and was beginning to have prostate issues. This product helped with both. It's not magic but it helps enough to make me confident that it's worth the money. I'm not quite 50 yet and wasn't interested in a precription prostate pill. This product is allowing me to avoid that. And when I need more effectiveness, I up the dosage. Simple. No side effects at all. Natural, safe product that has been around (I'm told) for centuries. Better than any other natural remedy, and yes I tried others. Half a billion middle eastern men can't all be wrong!"

290,Ethical 2-Quart Stainless Steel Double Diner,0/0,5.0,"This is exactly the item I was looking for in all the pet stores in my area. When I couldn't find it, I tried Amazon and there it was. I ordered it and had it shipped and it was exactly the item I wanted. It came immediately, in good condition, and my dogs are very content now that they have new high standing bowls for food and water. It also makes my life easier.I couldn't be happier with the Ethical 5 quart Stainless Steel Double Diner, 18-inch Tall Bowls that I bought for my Doberman Dogs who are tall and need to eat and drink at a taller than floor level."
291,Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads,0/0,5.0,The upgrade in performance after installing the new cutter system was the difference between night and day. Close shaves again after becoming more and more dissatisfied with the old unit.
292,ProLab Creatine Monohydrate 600g,0/1,1.0,"This stuff is complete and total garbage. They no longer use Creapure, yet most websites selling this still state that it uses German Creapure.I've tried many Creatines, and this is the worst. It'll give you sharp pains in your stomach, and you can actually feel your kidneys ache. Before any fanboys attempt to make light of my comments. The granulation of the Creatine per the description say it's micronized, but it has the weight and mass of sugar, it does not dissolve in a matter of seconds... it'll half dissolve in about 10 minutes. You'll have to constantly stir to distribute, and then it'll settle again. Most micronized Creatines dissolve in minutes into clear water. Not this garbage. Stay away!After receiving this and learning of the non-German Creatine, I took it once to try, got pains for about 8 hours... and then bought Optimum Nutrition's Creatine which IS made with Creapure."
293,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,4/4,5.0,"I just wanted to write in since I noticed that some of the reviews mentioned they received one large amount that needed to be measured into 6 separate applications. I'm pleased to report that I received 6 separate pre-measured applications. The seller was actually Amazon so maybe that made the difference. Hope this helps others. Buy when the seller is actually Amazon and you should get 6 separate applicators.I've been using Frontline for about 7 months now and have been very happy with the product. No fleas, no ticks, no problems."
294,Murray's Superior Hair Dressing Pomade,0/0,5.0,"I bought Murray's on a whim, before I knew it was THE classic men's hair styling product. Be warned; this is a man's pomade. Tough to apply, tough to wash out, and holds for days. I found my favorite method of use is to scoop about a nickel sized dollop and work between my hands to warm it up. Apply it to my damp hair, then use a hair dryer and comb to work it through my hair. I style while still using the hairdryer for a messy looking pompadour, or I comb it for a slick look. A little dab of Brylcreem makes it easier to work through.For removing, I'll either work in some Groom and Clean and leave it for 12 hours or so, or I'll work in some olive oil and then wash with dish soap (followed by normal shampoo and conditioner). I hear Mane n' Tail works well, though I haven't tried it.This stuff is fantastic. It's firmer than Dax but seems to hold a little better."
295,Eternity Cologne by Calvin Klein for men Colognes,2/2,1.0,"I am familiar with this product, it came perfect, labels, box, etc.It smell the same BUT it doesn't last after I use it.For some reason I use it and in less than an hour the smell is gone.It seems to me like a fake product.I tried to return it but I am not allowed."
296,Katie The Kitty Chair,0/0,5.0,We bought this chair as a camp chair for our 2 year old daughter. The product picture is an pretty accurate depiction. The chair is very cute and well made. It folds up easier and comes in a matching carrying bag with a strap and a place to write your child's name on it. My daughter can easily get in and out of the chair and really likes sitting in it. It is really a very cute kids chair!
297,Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate,0/0,5.0,"this thing is nice and sturdy, looks good too. really nice, really study and also easy on the eyes. great price. good item. great item gotta get his thing."
298,"SHANY Silver Aluminum Makeup Case, 4 Pounds",0/0,5.0,What a beauty! The removable dividers are a great plus. Great quality construction of the case. The extendable trays with adjustable dividers are great for versatility. I like that parts of it's made of aluminum for durability. The latches with key locks are a great feature. A very useful makeup case to own!
299,TAPE SURGICAL PAPER (6) Size,0/0,1.0,"This tape has no Holding to the skin power. The glue or adhesive used doesn't work at least not for me, if it wasn't costly I'd send it back. I've been using store brands that hold pretty well unless I sweat to much , I need it to hold the pain patches on every two days when they come loose the back pain tells me."
300,Tiger Balm Ultra Sports Rub,0/0,5.0,"My doctor turned me on to the Tiger Balm patches. They are harder to find some times, but really worth it. I've recently tried the ointment because I have arthritis in my knees and the pads are not convenient. This is the best ointment for numbing the stiffness and pain in my knees that I've found. The ""red"" extra strength is to much for me (it stains) and I wish they made the ointment without the smell (very menthol) but it's worth it to lessen the pain in my knees. This is definitely worth a try for both back and knee pain."
301,Deluxe Fragrant Stargazer Lilies (with FREE glass vase) - Flowers,0/0,5.0,"These arrive in bud, I think one was opening and they smell so good! They came with a vase. did I mention they smell so good. Ha Ha. Quite lovely."

I've used it for three years now.
303,Boppy Nursing Pillow with Slipcover,0/0,4.0,"I received a hand-me-down boppy from a friend, but was glad I purchased this second. It was firmer and puffier than the hand-me-down which was helpful in positioning my infant and keeping her head up.The fabric was not as soft as the Boppy brand Organic Cover I purchased for the hand-me-down though.Also, it did give off a smell when I first received it, but fortunately both the cover and pillow itself are machine washable/dryable and after running them though there was no smell."
304,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/1,1.0,"I purchased this Hide-A-Squirrel toy to give to a friend's dog at Christmas. However, I was lucky enough here in August to keep their dog for the weekend while they took a trip. Knowing the dog would not tell what she was getting for Christmas, I decided to let her play with the Hide-A-Squirrel. Well, she was able to pull fur off of the tails of the little squirrels. I spotted her trying to get the fur off of her tongue. Concerned that she would ingest the fur and have some intestinal blockage problem, I took all of it away from her and now must come up with some other Christmas present. I am glad I did not wait and give this defective toy at Christmas. It would be horrible to give a toy to a friend's dog and then have the dog get sick because of the toy."
305,"CHI Straight Guard Smoothing Styling Cream, 8.5 oz",1/1,1.0,"At first I thought the product was great, it did smooth and shine. But after a couple of days I noticed my hair was getting more and more build up and looked greasy and dull. After shampooing it for a week now, two times a shower the stuff is still there. HORRIBLE! Never again. I am going to go buy a clarifying shampoo to see if that gets it out."
306,Spearmint Oil 1 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"Don't do what I did. I put a couple of drops of oil in my a/c vents which mentholated the whole house for days and the windows propped open. Now I use the oil for making lotion, deodorant and flea repellant on my cat's collar."

308,Infrashine Original Professional Ceramic Styling Tool,0/0,5.0,"This iron works really well. It gets nice and hot so it works quickly (I have a lot of long hair) and it does a good job. The size is nice, and it has a really long cord which I appreciate. I recommend this and know two other people with the exact same one that also love theirs."
309,Sunsout Sun & Fun California 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"This is our second Sunsout puzzle and we really enjoyed it. Our first one was in the shape of a Japanese fan. Both puzzles had 1000 pieces and I must say that this one was easier for us to put together maybe because there were blocks of colors that made it easier to see where things went. Usually we put the frames together first, but this puzzle was easier to put the insides together and finish with the edges last. Both puzzles when finished were actually very beautiful and we will buy more from this company. They are quality puzzles, most all the pieces are cut clean through, and those few that are not are very easy to separate. They even give you contact info. in case you find a problem with the puzzle. We didn't contact them as our puzzles were great with no missing pieces."
310,Source Naturals Hot Flash,2/2,5.0,I have actually been using this product for years.. One day i was browsing on Amazon and found that i can get this product from there.Let me tell you i get twice as many pills for less than i have been paying for one bottle.. It was easy and quick and im saving alot of money.
311,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,5.0,"Our dog was notorious about pulling on the lease. Really annoying to try to walk through the city. I guess the ""redirection"" of the force this harness gives really works. They really don't like being pulled sideways and he stopped pulling entirely after about a week. He starts to revert to pulling again if you switch back to another harness, but still. For the price, it's a lot cheaper than many training classes and works great."
312,Red Oil First-Aid Oil by Nature's Balance - 2oz.,1/1,5.0,I have used red oil for over 45 years. My mother worked in a sewing factory all her life and I remember her talking about how the factory always had gallons of red oil through out the plant for workers always getting thread cut's and burns. She kept some at home.I went for yearswithout any when you couldn't find it anymore in drug stores. I was so happy when I went online and typed in red oil. I never run out. Just used some 5 minute's ago on a cut finger. I make sure my Mom who is now 87 years young and my sisters never run out. I recently sent a bottle to my uncle for a birthday present.

316,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"Because of noisy neighbors playing music, screaming, talking, and partying outside my bedroom window, I was at my wits end and needed something to drown out the middle of the night noise. I insulated my windows with two inch insulation foam as well as the wall behind my bed. It didn't work. I ordered the sound conditioner and immediately heard a difference. Not only can my husband watch tv in the neighboring room and I don't hear a thing, but it also drowns out the treble of the music of the next door neighbors and also their midnight screaming and partying. The fan does make a humming sound that I would prefer to not hear and it doesn't drown out bass and low sounds, but overall, I am happy with my purchase."
317,Tend Skin,0/0,5.0,I love this product! it works better than any other similar product i have ever used. Love it for the bichini area.
318,Derma Wand Kit,10/11,1.0,"This product was awful! It burns and it made my wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth worse. I followed the instructions to a ""T"" and this product has aged me about 10 years. I would never recommend this product."
319,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Our son is almost 4 years old and mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime or for comfort when he was upset. We tried discouraging the thumb sucking since he was about 2.5 years old with very little success (that was when he went from sucking his thumb all the time to only at night and when upset). At his last dentist appt, his dentist recommended Mavala. It was amazing to see how quickly this product worked without any frustration or heartache for us and our son! We talked to him about it before using it and he was resistant but within the first week he stopped sucking his thumb! We applied as directed every 2 days for about a week and a half. It's been 3 weeks now without any thumb sucking. I thought for sure we would need one of those horrible (and expensive) thumb guards, but nope! this did the trick! Highly recommend!"
320,Revlon ColorSilk Beautiful Color Hair Coloring Products,2/2,5.0,"For someone who has been dying their hair every month for the past four years, I've learned a thing or two about hair dye, and this brand is by far my favorite. Not only is it less damaging to your hair (and wallet) than other dyes, but they have the best selection of reds! I receive a lot of compliments on how natural and pretty the color is whenever I use the Bright Auburn or Light Auburn shades, and find that even the faded color is quite pretty. Like all red hair dye, it tends to fade quickly, but I've found that with proper care the color can stay pretty vibrant up to about two weeks, holding the redish tones for three or four. I'd recommend this brand for anyone considering going a ginger tone or anyone who doesn't want to fry the hell out of their hair with other boxed dyes. Overall, perfect hair dye at the perfect price!"
321,Petstages Catnip Chew Mice,0/0,5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from these mice because let's face it, there are a lot of different kinds of mice on the market. These are unique with the mesh coating they have on the body part of the mouse though. All 3 of my cats play with these in their own way. My youngest likes to play fetch on the stairs with them while my oldest likes to play fetch with them as I throw it to different pieces of furniture. My third who usually doesn't get in to mice, just likes to bat it around and then push it under the furniture to fish it out again. So cute! They use to prefer the rattle mice, but they like these equally or even better than those now. I'm ordering more."
322,Oxy Odor and Stain Remover for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I have 2 basset hounds who have occasional accidents. This is the best odor and stain remover I have found. if you blot up the stain and then spray Fresh and Clean on, let ist a few hours, and blot again the stain actually comes out! I have tried other brands with little success. Unfortunately, this product is hard to find in stores and I am ordering strictly from Amazon now."
323,Viviscal Extra Strenth Dietary Supplement,2/2,5.0,I had gastric surgery in November of 2011. I lost my hair by handfulls and was so self conscious. I saw this product on Dr Oz and decided to try it. I have been on it for 5 months. I have new hair growth and my hair feels so much healthier. I Works!!
324,"Hagerty 15507 7-Ounce Silver Cleaner, White",1/2,1.0,"This was a total waste of money. I saw almost no change after I used the cleaner on a pair of silver earrings. The earrings were barely cleaned at all. I purchased this product because my current silver cleaner by Connoisseurs was running low after 2 years of frequent use. When the new cleaner didn't work, I dropped the earrings into the old cleaner by Connoisseurs (Connoisseurs Silver Jewelry Cleaner); it worked beautifully. Do not buy this brand. It is useless!"
325,JW Pet Company GripSoft Flea Comb for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I used the comb with my siberian husky and short hair domestic cat. It worked great with both of them, I for the fleas out of both with not much problems and they didn't seem upset about the comb. The only thing was at my sibe butt because he would really complain but that's because he would get wet all the time sitting at the small pool so the area was matted but this comb never claimed to be good for matted fur or shedding so it did for me what it should have."
326,All Food Fortifier Supplement Size,0/0,5.0,thought I would try this product with my 3 finicky cats to upgrade their diet nutritionally from the commercial cat food that I can afford to buy. wanted to try better quality wet food but it's cost prohibitive so I bought this. all 3 actually like it and eat the whole can of food--usually I'm throwing out some of it the next morning. will keep using this product because I feel better about feeding commercially while boosting their nutrition; plus they like it!!!!!

328,Dutch Blitz,0/0,5.0,"I have been looking everywhere for this game! It is a combination of speed/spit (whatever you call it) and solitaire. It's played with at least four people, and makes for a fun game night. It's much easier playing with this official deck than playing with four different normal card decks."
329,Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Bounce & Spin Zebra,0/0,5.0,"We were visiting someone when my two year old first discovered this toy. We couldn't get her off of it when it was time to leave. The zebra seems very durable, she jumps and bounces on it like crazy. The only problem we had was about an hour after we got it the sound stopped working, but Fisher Price is great and sent a replacement out immediately at no cost to us. It was super easy to assemble and took less than five minutes. I never would have thought to get this for her since she was already two but after owning one I would say it is great for a 1-3 year old."
330,Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel,1/1,5.0,"I have acne prone skin and had a break out after using a new foundation. I was given a small sample of this product to try. Less than 2 days later, my acne was clear. Several days after that, my skin started to look brighter-healthy glow. I have used some sort of prescription and/or non-prescription acne product for more than 20 years and I have never seen a product work as fast as this one!!!!!"
331,"Coffee Masters Perfect Potful Breakfast Blend Ground Coffee, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)",2/2,5.0,"This is a great coffee blend. My husband and I have a cup of coffee every morning. Because of the packaging, the coffee never gets old and you can adjust the amount that you want. This coffee is perfect each time. I'm very particular about the type of coffee I like, and this coffee tastes Great!!"
332,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,I was disappointed that the pamper's baby dry did not stay dry all night like the swaddlers did on my 5mo.
333,"Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal Meal Replacement Bar, Super Cookie Crunch, 12 Bars, 3.52 Ounces",0/0,5.0,"I decided to get this through Amazon after I realized just how much I was spending on this meal bar at my local convenience store.If you get the free shipping, it's a savings of over 40%. If you haven't tasted this protein bar yet, it's delicious! In fact, it's the best I've ever had. It has very high protein compared to most other meal bars and is loaded with other important nutrients. I highly recommend!"
334,Drakkar Noir By Guy Laroche For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"I bought a bottle of this way back in the day loved it then, love it now. I gather from some stuff I've read online that some consider it a dated, eighties ""lounge lizard"" type scent but it still smells great I think."
335,Spectrum 33300 Mop And Broom Organizer,0/0,5.0,I am very pleased with this item. Bought it tentatively - hoping it would live up to the reviews I had read. Only issue I found was my husband could not find where my brooms were. HAHA. Would buy it again.
336,Derma Wand Kit,11/12,4.0,"I get good results with the derma-wand using it with Elizabeth Gant's anti-aging serums and doing it slightly differnt than the directions. It requires more work than advertised, but I don't mind, the results are worth it to me. (the directed way did not work with me)I use it once, or twice, a day. I cover all my skin in rows (like cutting grass with a lawn mower) leaving no area untreated (except tender eye-lids.) I use a high setting everywhere except upper-eye area under brows."
337,Nature's Way Super Fisol Fish Oil,1/1,5.0,"I have been taking this product for nearly a week and I couldn't be happier. Let's be honest, fish oil is one of those supplements that you have to have faith in because the benefits aren't going to be seen simply by taking it for a while. The main reason I like it is because there is no belching, no after-taste, no digestive issues or upset stomach, and these are the things I was concerned about from my experience with other brands. I had my shoulder operated on several years ago and I can sometimes hear the joint when I rotate it, or even feel it. Since I began taking this supplement, the joint seems to work much smoother. I haven't heard or felt the movements at all!"
338,Amerigel Barrier Lotion,1/1,5.0,"Amerigel Barrier Lotion is a very good product. I like that it contains Oakin, the antibacterial ingredient in Amerigel Wound Dressing. The Barrier Lotion provides protection plus healing. Shipping service was great."
339,Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,1/1,5.0,"I love my Moby Wrap. I got one with my middle son (now 4) and used it with my youngest and am now excited to get a new one with our soon-to-be-born baby. I am 5 foot nothing and I have NO problem using it. Yes, there is extra fabric but I like that it wraps around my waist an extra time. I love that it gives me a bit of tummy coverage especially in the first month after birth. I live in Las Vegas and have used the Moby in the summer without either of us overheating. When my boys got a bit older (6-9 months), I loved using the Hip position. Much easier than just holding them on your hip. I admit that I have yet to test the 35lb limit of the wrap as my boys started walking before they were that big. I can see that it is a bit cumbersome to put on in public. I have found that the way the Moby wraps around you almost looks like a shirt and if I am at a restaurant or somewhere sitting down, I can take the baby out but keep the wrap on. Then I can just put my baby back in the wrap when I need to, no need to re-wrap. I don't usually wear it in a situation where I am taking it on and off again. And I have gotten very good at wrapping it and can do it quite quickly. All-in-all, I can see where most of the complaints come from but they are not an issue for me. I love mine and am excited to use one again. Also I get so many compliments when I'm using it!"
340,Boss Pet - Prestige 100ft Skyline Trolly,4/5,3.0,"I've had the Boss Pet - Prestige 100ft Skyline Trolly for a few months now. The configuration is as follows; 2 corner posts 90ft apart, 10ft on either side of the line clear and a 50lb dog attached. The pulley wheel is plastic which has worn almost completely through to the point where it just drags instead of roles. All the metal clamps are rusted and one of the switches is broken. The line itself is pretty much intact and the screw hooks have held up nicely. Plan to replace all other parts though. Also, to prevent your pet from wrapping around each end post/tree you'll want to buy additional wire clamps to use as line stops."
341,"Lixit Wide Mouth Bird Bottle, 10-Ounce",1/1,5.0,"Plus:-I had no leaking issues, works great-The ball is rubber, not metal, much nicer for birds-Easy to fill wide openingMinus:-Does not fit on Vision cages, which have horizontal bars. It fits sort-of"
342,Chicco Toys 4 In 1 Ride On,0/0,5.0,"Both our boys absolutely love this toy. It has had use for four years and is in great shape. The side bars and rocking console come off and you can attach a parent bar that comes with it for guided strolls with foot rests or with out. So it is extremely versatile.When our boys were little babies learning to sit, it was a nice rocker, and a fun spot for the baby to watch the older child play. They love the music and noises and zoom all over the house in it at least once a day. Both the 2 year old and the four year old love this.We got the electronics wet, and ordered a new electronics console. I think it is great that this piece can be easily (and inexpensively) replaced.If you could only buy one ride on toy this would be a good choice. It is durable and multifunctional, and will grow with you r child. It rocks, it can be used to push off on and strengthen the legs, and it has a nice smooth and quick ride to it. It is easy to steer and stop, goes fine on gravel or pavement, or hardwood floors without marking them."
343,"Fantasy by Britney Spears, 3.3 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I love this smell from Britney Spears. One of my favorite perfumes.I thought the 3.3 oz for 24$ was too good to be true, so I ordered it anyways.The bottle came 3 days earlier than expected.Nothing was damaged and packaging was sufficent.I was thrilled to find out that it wasn't too good to be true!The bottle arrived 3.3 oz. I think the reason it was so cheap is because its a tester and they arent for sale by manufacturer?But anyways, I was very pleased with service..and hopefully once my bottle runs out, they still have some left.HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!!!"
344,American Health Probiotic Acidophilus with Bifidus,0/0,5.0,"I was looking for something that my daughter could use to help keep her regulated. She still takes Miralax since she suffers from constipation. Well I purchased these chewables from W****Foods and yes I paid a little more ($4.00) but I wanted them quickly. Well the lady in the store stated that the banana flavor tasted very good. Well my daughter loves bananas. I gave her one and she said ""ohh mommmy this taste really good."" Well I had to taste one to see what she was talking about and yes I must say it is very good...IF I didn't know any better I would have thought it was candy. The directions state to take one wafer 3 times per day but I only give her 1 tablet every morning with her vitamin. (They call it a wafer but it is a tablet..think something like a tums antacid in size)She has taken this tablet and missed her daily dose of Miralax and was able to go to the bathroom without any issues...will have to see about skipping 2 days to see if the tablet alone is effective. Definitely would recommend....I will buy it from here next time."
345,Eo Products Hand Soap Gallon Bulk Products,0/0,5.0,i really enjoy the scent of this soap. it seems to last forever and washes of my hands easily. i would buy this again.
346,"PetSafe Stubborn Dog In-Ground Fence, PIG00-10777",1/1,5.0,"It took few days to train the dogs, but it work excellent. Now I'm more relax letting my dogs out without the worries that whey will go out of my lotThanks"
347,My Brest Friend Pillow,0/0,5.0,"I used it starting from my hospital stay and was very pleased with it. I was comfortable, the baby was comfortable. I gave birth in France where this product is not sold, so lots of nurses were at first surprised to see me use it. However, all of them commented at how much more correctly shaped it was compared to local pillows which are kind of U shaped very soft, deformable pillows. I used it for the first 2-3 months (I prefer to nurse her lying next to her)."
348,Ethical Pet Spotbrites Laser Pet Toy and Exerciser,0/0,2.0,"While the laser light itself is strong, the product itself is shoddily constructed. The rubber button is prone to falling off and if it's lost, you can't hold it down in order to operate the laser."
349,Twinlab Acetyl L-Carnitine,0/0,4.0,This product came sooner than expected and helps with workouts. I have taken this supplement before but bought it locally for a much higher price. It seems to sustain a longer workout without exhausting muscles too early. It also seems to enhance power. I would definitely purchase this product again.
350,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,0/1,5.0,"It shipped super fast. It was one of those open boxes, but.... it's diapers, Why pay more for a closed box? all the diapers were still in there wrapped in the plastic and the huggies rewards points were usable too. I'm pleased."
351,Almased Almased Multi Protein Powder,5/6,4.0,"I have been trying to find a good protein/meal shake that doesn't have a lot of artificial ingredients. The ingredients in Almased are basic which is what I like. The texture is a little coarser than other shakes I have tried, but this one keeps me satisfied much longer without making my blood sugar go through the roof. In my opinion I think the trade off is fair. I do dress it up a little though. I either add stevia and a table spoon of regular unsweetened cocoa powder, or sugar free hazelnut espresso syrup with a table spoon of dark unsweetened cocoa powder. Without any dressing up, the taste and texture remind me of a cross between muffin batter and cake batter. There are no artificial flavors but it has a creamy flavor, probably from the honey. I prefer to mix it with ice in the blender. If you make it with coffee and chocolate for a mocha flavor the coffee has to be at least room temperature or colder to avoid killing the probiotics. There are a few other recipes I want to try as well, just haven't gotten around to it yet.I haven't used it long term for weight loss, but have used it to recover from overdone splurges or when I'm just looking for a very light meal. If I splurge and put on a couple pounds I can usually recover and lose them again after doing my shakes for a couple days.Pros:Basic ingredientsLow glycemic impactSatisfying and stays with youGreat for getting in extra protein or for managing weightCons:The texture is a little coarser than most other shakes, but that is because it is minimally processed (in comparison to other mixes)The price is a bit high but this seller is lower than what I can get it locally forShipping was fast and arrived just as promised. I just placed my second order from the same seller."
352,"Yeowww! Catnip Toy, Yellow Banana",0/0,5.0,"Our cats are very picky... but all loved the banana. No mess and keeps us all entertained for hours. We can't stop laughing on how our cats hold it, just like a popsicle and lick and rub it. It seems to be the perfect fit and all go crazy with this thing. A+ toy"
353,H.A. Joint Formula by Purity Products - 90 Capsules [Health and Beauty],0/1,5.0,I started using HA Joint by Purity about 2 years ago. It works great for me especially for the pain in my joints (around the knee area). When I don't take this product I can definately feel the difference in my joints. I am so glad that I was able to find it through Amazon @ a better price. Delivery is fast & I'm glad I don't have to wait too long.Thank you!
354,Toypedo,0/0,5.0,"This has been a toy in our pool for the last 3 years. It is durable and boy does it zip through the pool. Just watch out, if it is coming at you, because it is heavy!"
355,Portable Roll Up Piano Keyboard - JB4509JB4509,1/1,1.0,"I ordered this product from Amazon. It was not advertised as a toy!! On Amazon, the boxlooks adult but when I received the Roll up Piano Keyboard it was in a pink box with achilds picture on the front with the same JB # on it. The one with the child's picture is about$7.00 cheaper and I was refused a refund. It's okay but not worth the money at any price.I ended up buying a regular inexpensive keyboard and it's so much better!!!! Don't waste yourmoney on this one!!!!"
356,Solvit 62314 Waterproof Hammock Seat Cover for Pets,1/1,5.0,Do not buy one of those cheap $14 covers! I did and it lasted about 3 weeks before it tore. The Solvit cover is much better material and design.
357,KidCo Food Mill,0/0,3.0,"The metal grinder portion of this was better than the old plastic version ( i bought the same model food mill in 2008)..but..and a big but..the handle is sooo small!!! Half the size of what it probably should be..it doesnt make sense as to why it's so short! I even measured it alongside my old one, to make sure I wasn't hallucinating...when I use it, it makes me feel like I am turning the handle with my thumb and pointer finger...other than that, works fine...but I kept my old one, and I'm glad I did!"
358,"Ethical Atomic Bouncing Ball Cat Toy, 2-Piece",0/0,1.0,"These are cute, unique toys, but I was surprised to see how small they are, very disappointed in the size."
359,3-pair Pack of PUTTY BUDDIES Floating Formula Soft Silicone Ear Plugs for Swimming/ Bathing,0/0,4.0,One package of plugs is more than enough for us for how often we go swimming. Make sure to get the headband though as they won't stay in without it. I was able to use these on my 19 month old daughter without an issue.
360,"Palmolive Eco Gel Dishwasher Detergent, 45 Ounce (Pack of 3)",0/0,4.0,"I have been using Palmolive ECO for several years and I have not experienced the white film so many talk about. I do wonder if it has something to do with the water in certain areas. I live in the St. Louis area and our water is excellent. In addition we also have a water softener, which we installed a few years ago, but even before the water softener we did not experience the white film.I do LOVE this product. I was having such a terrible time with etching of glassware that I tried any and every ""green"" dishwasher detergent out there, but none were good at actually getting my dishes clean. While Palmolive ECO is not completely ""green"" it is the only phosphate-free detergent that I have tried that gets my dishes clean, AND I have not had an etched glass since.Again, no white film here."
361,Digital Acupuncture Physiotherapy Machine,1/1,4.0,"I have fibromyalgia and had tried acupuncture which really worked. That's what led me to look for something similar (no needles of course).This item is very powerful, settings that go higher than my chiropractor and acupuncturist used. I've never used the highest setting. Works great for sore muscles no matter what the cause! It has variable strengths, modes (they all feel different), and a timer. I bought one to have in reserve and one for my boyfriend. This was a GREAT deal.I would have given it 5 stars if it had two more contacts. From the pattern, it seems both electrodes should go on the same muscla."
362,Nature's Plus Liquid Source Of Life Oz - 30 OZ,1/1,4.0,"I started taking this when my local health food store ran out of the Lifetime Basics liquid Multi, when I tried this I instantly liked it so much more. It was a little more expensive but worth it, most local store has 25% off for Lifetime products, no discount for Nature's Plus products. The other brand I used tasted horrible, like bad seaweed, I also had to eat a fairly big meal before taking it or I would start to feel like I needed to vomit about 15-20 minutes after swallowing it. I don't get that at all with this product. I can wake up and take my one capful and not feel sick or anything. I don't mind the flavor either. Most of the negative reviews are because of the taste, so its really your preference, some people don't like the flavor, others don't mind. My thing is, its one capful/2 tablespoons a day. If you can't even do that for your health, then, well.... Water doesn't taste as good as Soda, but you aren't gonna stop drinking that are ya?"
363,PINK SUGAR by Aquolina EDT SPRAY 3.4 OZ,0/0,5.0,My sister and I absolutely adore this sweet scent. It makes me feel young every time I wear it. Even my hubby loves it!
364,Niacinamide 250 mg 250 Caps by Swanson Premium,0/0,5.0,"When buying vitamin and minerals supplements on Amazon, I try to always buy Swanson because it's been a good brand for me so far. I bought this niacinamide because I had developed a sensitivity to niacine and it gave me what they call ""flushing"". I don't think that is nearly a powerful enough word for what happens. The first time it happened, I was ready to go to the emergency room. The second time was worse, but I figured out what it was and thought that I could get through one more round without ER treatment; and I did. It feels like your blood veins are on fire and it goes all over your body and then you itch. It lasts quite a while. For me, the second time, it was about an hour for the fire/itch part in full force, then another hour of getting better gradually. So I read that niacinamide was ""non-flushing"" and bought this product. I've had no problems at all with it."
365,Now Foods Nutritional Yeast,1/1,4.0,"Good product if you are a vegetarian. You can add this into any vegetarian dish and boost its nutritional value. I especially add it into rice dishes that I cook, which are usually lacking in protein. It does not make a huge difference to the taste of the dish, but it isn't entirely odorless. Blends in very well with my Indian vegetarian recipes without altering the original taste."
366,Medi-Dyne Pro Stretch,1/1,4.0,"I had been experiencing pulled achilles tendons from running, which was causing pretty bad heel pain. I was looking for relief in any form and came across this stretching system on Amazon with good reviews. I have been using this for only a few days and have already felt relief in my achilles tendon's just from using this to stretch them a couple times throughout the day. It provides a better stretch than using a wall or staircase to stretch. All you do is position your foot in it while near a wall, using the wall to balance yourself and letting your other leg just dangle. You rock backward and you will immediately feel a stretching feeling from the back of your heel all the way up to the top of your calf muscle. You hold that for about 30 seconds than you can switch to the other foot or do again if you feel the need to stretch more. I didn't even realize how tight my calf muscles were until I used this and I will continue to use this in the future to prevent injury and prior to running.The only other recommendation and note I have is that you definitely want to have a sneaker or some sort of foot protection on when using this and not just go barefoot or with a sock. The surface and heel cup are very hard and it doesnt feel great on your foot if you don't have a shoe on, hence the 4 stars rather than 5. Other than that, this is great for anyone who wants a little help with their stretching."
367,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,1/1,1.0,"I purchased this original pet fountain along with the Drinkwell Reservoir, 50 Ounce. They arrived pretty quickly however when I set it up and put water in it, the fountain leaked all over my floor. There was a warning this may happen so it has happened a lot! When I called customer service as instructed with the warning, they asked me if I got the original or deluxe model.When I said original they sounded like Uhm yeah and told me to put oil on the O ring. I did but it still leaked. I had to fax them my proof of purchase and they said I should receive a new O ring with in 6 weeks. This makes me a pretty Unhappy customer. This one has a design flaw the pump screws into the bowl and if the seal is not just so it leaks. DON'T get this one! If I were to do it again and knew about the O ring and the deluxe model I would not have bought this. I feel stuck! I did not get to use it one day...."
368,Wood Expressions Tournament Chess Set with Black Canvas Bag,0/0,5.0,"A pleasant suprise. I didn't expect much for $32, but this is a nice set with well balanced (not light) pieces. The carrying case and roll-up mat are also decent quality. I'll order another one to give away."
369,Bodyblade with DVD and chart,2/2,5.0,"item arrived prompty, as described. it's a great way to work on core and upper extremity muscles without overworking arthritic joints."
370,Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,0/0,5.0,"One of my best friends owns this bouncer and I own a kick N play (handed down) and a leap frog bouncer. However, all of my (3) children have prefered the Rainforest bouncer at her house. I wish I had bought this. It keeps them occupied for longer and I've even watched both her children and mine fall asleep in it!"
371,Prairie View Industries Threshold Ramp,0/0,5.0,"This is my third one, they are very much like it says. The only thing is I had a handyman install, that's because I am unable. I would recommend this to everyone looking for this style."
372,Hugo Boss Hugo,0/0,4.0,"I got this for my husband and he likes it very much and wears it every day. Also, relatively affordable. The delivery was fast, too!"
373,"Nylabone Healthy Edible Bone, Roast Beef Flavored with Vitamins",0/0,1.0,"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."
374,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,4.0,If you cannot obtain this tea locally this is an excellent product though not a better price than I can get it locally.
375,"3M Littmann Master Classic II Stethoscope, 24 Karat Gold Plated Chestpiece, Black Tube, 27 inch, 2142G",1/8,1.0,"This is a terrible product. These reviews must be fabricated by employees manufacturing these. It states that it ""offers efficiency in auscultation that is unprecedented in a general examination stethoscope. Its patented single-sided tunable diaphragm allows monitoring of both high and low frequency sounds without having to turn over the chest piece. Features high performance single-lumen tubing, non-chill rim and patented Littmann soft-sealing ear tips. Includes a three-year warranty."" This entire description is false. The only efficiency in auscultation that was unprecedented was the sound of my money being stolen out of my back pocket by false sales claims. The stethoscope's high and low frequency without having to turn over the chest piece is described in the manual as pressing it soft or hard. Pressing soft gives provides no frequency at all. Pressing hard gives a faint frequency. I wouldn't purchase anything from 3M Littmann again. It has a 3yr warranty, but when I tried to return it, Amazon lists it as ""Not Available for Return"""
376,Jelly Bean Snake Can,0/0,4.0,"This can of snakes does basically what it is meant to do. That is, it surpises your friends one time, and good! The design of the can is deceptive enough to invite the curious. After all, who can resist jelly beans! And boy do these snakes fly! Right across the room! One thing to be wary of is the cap and grooves on the can -they are not the best and most secure as the platic groove does not hold the cap on very well and has a ""hair trigger"". In fact, you can overturn the cap, resulting in a misfire. Would have prefered a metal can with secure cap staying power. But for the price, you just have to order one!"
377,Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,2/2,5.0,She loves itI no longer get my ears worn out with how horrible it is to be pregnant and trying to sleep (I used to get this when I was trying to sleep too....)She's happy - My ears are happy - I'm happyJust buy it for gods sake...:) ladies we love you all really
378,Hartz UltraGuard Plus Flea and Tick Spray for Dogs,1/1,4.0,"I used just a few sprays on my dog and rubbed it in. Smells good and left him soft. ONLY put on your pet lightly and see how he takes it first. I have used this on many dogs over the years. Most did very good with it. One threw up, so didn't use it on him anymore. If you have a lot of fleas you need to give a flea bath first. Otherwise the sick fleas jump off and infest your house if they live - most likely they are already infesting your house. This spray should be used if you see one or two fleas and are doing the regular flea maintenance (drops, etc) on your pet. Fleas are very resistant to everything and very bad in the fall. This helped rid them, just make sure you use lightly as it is a strong pesticide.This ONLY last a few days, so you may want to reapply lightly once a week in the worst of the flea season.Note, you pet may be sleepy after application if he licks it a lot."
379,Kouros by Yves Saint Laurent for Men - 3.3 Ounce EDT Spray,7/7,4.0,"Holy wow. I have read some reviews saying that Kouros has been reformulated and is weaker, or toned down from what it used to be. If this is the case, I can't imagine how potent it was before reformulation. Lordamercy. So anyways, on to the scent. The opening is funky and strange. Has some incense going on, and God knows what all. But it is loud, and funky. Just hold your horses, because this monster dries down to be one smooth, long lasting work of art. About an hour after applying, it loses that harshness from the beginning and is very wearable. It also lasts the whole day. I mean like 2 or 3 sprays max, dudes. You will absolutely send people running if you over-apply. Like all YSL frags, this sweet baby is worth your money. A classic and funky work of art. Oh yeah, I've heard people say stuff about Kouros smelling like sweat,feces, pee, semen, and the like. (no, I'm not kidding, go to basenotes and read for yourself) Don't concern yourself with that, I don't get any of that at all. Also, I've read a hundred dozen reviews saying that young dudes shouldn't wear this. Bullcrap. People nowadays are too used to watery-ADGio-fresh-wussified-melon-ball-smelling-wuss cologne. Stand out from the crowd, show people you got a pair, and buy a man's cologne. Word."
380,Manic Panic Puple Haze Hair Dye,6/6,5.0,"This is amazing! I did not bleach my hair, I'm a natural brunette. It looks JUST LIKE Katy Perry's hair!!!!!!!! I did let it set for 2 hours instead of 30 mins & then soaked it in half white vinegar and half water."
381,Build A Birdhouse,0/0,5.0,My husband had such an enjoyable time putting this birdhouse together! He was so proud when he was done & I hung it outside for our birdies to find. Keep those senior minds active!
382,"Earth Therapeutics Foot Doctor, Pedicure Kit",0/0,5.0,"I bought this to cure my horrible, dry, summer feet. After just one use, my feet were SO much better! After using it for a week, my feet were as good as new again! Now I only give myself the pedicure (using only these products) about once a week to maintain my soft feet! My only complaint would be that the lotion bottle was open when I opened the package and some of the lotion had spilled out, but that's not Amazon's fault. :)"
383,"Caldesene Baby Care Powder, 5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"This product is excellent and really clears up my babies bum very quickly when he has a rash. It also prevents rash when we use it regularly. I am going to try the blue one next since it is talc-free and see if I like it as well as the pink one. They both have zinc oxide in them so both are skin barriers which we need to protect my son's bum from ""poopies"". The pink one goes on very smooth and smells pleasant. It rinses off my hands much easier than barrier diaper ointment however protects his bum just as well. As a pediatric ICU nurse, I wish I had this product to use on my patients in the ICU with diaper rash."
384,World King Sized Candy Sticks 24 boxes,1/1,1.0,"These are my FAVORITE candy! I decided that, when I went to a local candy store here and they wanted to charge me $1.00 a box, that I needed to just order my own for cheaper! The shipping was very quick.However, when I received them, they're all broken! I opened numerous boxes and all are in pieces. I couldn't find one full candy cigarette. On top of THAT, they are hard as rocks! Definitely not the delicious candy that I know and love. These were disgusting. I will not be ordering from here again."
385,Dana Monsieur Musk Cologne,0/0,5.0,I love this fragrance. It is a very clean smell. I know it is an old product and very hard to find but well worth the effort.
386,Bottom Buddy,0/0,3.0,"I would actually give this three and a half stars. I am now ordering my fifth or sixth Bottom Buddy (can't remember). They do eventually break. A few years ago they improved the sturdiness of the handle which was a good thing.I have tried other toileting aids but this works best for me. That said I still need to wipe a lot to get clean. The angle is not perfect. It is expensive, but what are you going to do?It is important to insert the tissue correctly - just open one of the petals to stick it in. If you use the button to open all the petals the paper is held too tightly and will not fall out as it should when you try to release it. Even then the paper does not always fall out and I need to shake it loose. I find that 3 or 4 squares of toilet paper is enough, depending on the thickness of the paper. I still go through a fair amount of toilet paper before I am clean.Do order a spare because as I said it will eventually break and you will be glad you did. Keep the spare in your travel bag so you don't forget it when you travel."
387,MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation - Choose Colors -,3/3,1.0,"When I found my favorite MAC compact at such a steep discount, I was through the roof with excitement. I was a little skeptical though. When I got the product, it looked pretty legit and I had some left over from an original I had bought at the MAC store to compare. The one I purchased here was just a little yellower than the original one I had but did not think anything of it as mine was a little over a month old. Immediately with the first try, I knew this product was not the same. I have been using this compact for over 6 years and have NEVER had an issue with it until I bought it here. No matter how hard I tried to get the powder on the sponge, it would not absorb onto the sponge the same way. Eventually, these hard, dark bumpy areas formed on the powder so I avoided that area of the compact because it would not budge on to the sponge at all. I did a half and half face comparison with my leftover MAC and the this one and all my blemishes and dark spots were still visible on the ""fake MAC"" side. The original side, flawless and perfect. I was really disappointed but should have known better when trying to score a deal. Maybe I got an old expired one, I don't know. I threw it out after my experiment from disgust. Needless to say, I will never be purchasing MAC products discounted online."
388,Sunbeam/Oster 1500 watt wall mounted hair dryer.,0/0,5.0,I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.

390,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"What an amazing color! I've been looking for a very deep creamy navy for months - and this is it. It doesn't even need a second coat, is shiny, non-streaky, and will probably be great for stamping (haven't tried it yet)."
391,"Quercetti Super Marble Run Vortis, 224 Pieces",2/4,1.0,"My son *really* wanted a marble run for his birthday. I bought this based on a model we played with at a local toy store, which contained real marbles. The description on amazon says ""real marbles."" The book, pictures, and box all show real marbles. This toy showed up with *plastic pellets* instead of a single real marble. Thanks, amazon, for selling me a product under false pretenses. Not only does my son NOT have a MARBLE run for his birthday, but I'll have to track down a huge bag of many extraneous marbles somewhere and buy them separately.Btw, this toy comes with no set up instructions other than the picture, and is very flimsy. I ought to return it on sheer principle of there being no real marbles in it, but my son would be sad."
392,"Ayr Saline Nasal Gel, With Soothing Aloe, 0.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)",3/3,5.0,"Unfortunately I learned the hard way. I had dry, cracked and bleeding nose almost all the time. When I searched internet somebody suggested to put vaseline and without investigating further I started using vaseline and it fixed my problem by causing a huge problem"
393,Duro-Med Contour Lumbar Cushion for Bucket Seats,0/1,1.0,"The cushion is firm, not too big, nicely shaped for my 2012 Camry seats, and comfortable. The problem is that the front seam on the side facing the passenger is coming apart after only two months. I'm beginning to think this is what they meant by ""removable cover,"" since as other reviews have noted there doesn't seem to be a way to remove the cover. Unfortunately, my return window expired after only one month, so I can't return it, apparently not even to replace an obviously defective product. I'll keep this cushion for as long as I can, and may even try to re-cover it. But I won't buy another one and can't recommend it."

396,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,5.0,"I've never really been a vibrator kinda gal but reading the reviews on this I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did because this toy is freaking AMAZING!!!!!!! It is bigger then I thought but it is for the G-Spot so it doesnt need to go in all the way. As for the smell it is strong right out of the box so I washed it several times to tone the smell down. Seriously though it is just a plastic smell that goes away with use and for the pleasure it gives me, that is not keeping me away from it lol. This is a must get toy if you want that intense orgasm that makes your toes curl... WOW!!!!!"

398,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,1/1,3.0,The Alvita tea is not very tasty. But it does pack a punch of benefits. It is priced well. Billberry is healthy for you. I gave it a 3 only because of taste.
399,"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32"", White",0/0,5.0,"After reading another customer's review, about how their baby fell asleep in this changing pad when changing diapers, I knew I had to buy one.We used this pad in our baby's basinette until she grew too long for the basinette. She slept through most nights and the pad fit perfectly in the basinette. The shape of the sides made us feel more comfortable, because she couldn't roll over on her tummy as easily. Because of SDD you don't want your baby sleeping on their tummies.The pad has held up well. We always wrapped a light blanket around it. We also were able to just take the pad as her mobile bed when we flew into California to visit family for a week. She ""slept like a baby"" every night even though we were in a foreign place, to her."
400,Sun-In Sun-In Hair Lightener Spray Tropical Breeze,1/1,5.0,"This stuff is amazing. I have medium brown hair and I used it with the hairdryer for about a week and noticed my hair turning an orange color and it looks great. Also great if you want an ombre hair style by spraying it heavily on the ends and a lighter spray on the way up. I really like this and would recommend it to someone else. Just make sure not to spray more on the top of your head than the rest, otherwise you get a weird glow on top of your head."
401,Garden of Life Primal Defense,0/1,1.0,"I started this product 6 wks ago and nothing but problems!!! Three {3} bouts of gastritis, with one landing me in the hospital. This product did not help my stomach, but, made it worse. I discontinued use and feel much better. Go with Amazing Green Superfood. A superior product and one i have been using for over 1 year with no gastritis!!! This is a con item product by Rubin."
402,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,"My Dermatologist told me that the white heads on my chin would never go away. My Dad told me to try the castile soap (Orange w/ tea tree oil). I was amazed at how fast the white heads disappeared. I have to use it everyday though.I just rub a few drops in my hands (Undiluted) and clean away. The Lavendar flavor my husband and my self put in our bath water. It's wonderful. My sister uses the Baby flavor on all her kids. Two have sensitive skin and two do not. She thinks it's great stuff two. Oh yeah, I got the Oil of Olay face scrubber last Christmas. I use it some. I have Rosacea on my face and neck and the Excema is around my eyebrows. The Tea tree oil is still the best hands down. It's a bit pricey. But, I figure if it works with my problem areas, It's priceless. My Dad uses the Peppermint to wash his hair. He loves the tinglyness but Knowing his hair is clean is the best feeling. You can actually use the tea tree oil (Orange) for washing your hair, shaving, cleaning you face, put in your bath water for the enticing aroma and cleanliness, I could go on and on. The tea tree is the best for all around cleanliness. In other words you don't need all the different flavors to do the job, The one is sufficent."
403,"Eden Organic Pumpkin Seeds, Dry Roasted, 4-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 15)",0/0,3.0,"These were a good alternative to sunflower seeds, but quickly became too expensive to re-order. I order another brand now at a much lower price per ounce."
404,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,1/1,5.0,"I have tried about every product out there - the last was that Pioneer porcelain thing - my cats hated it and kept knocking the top off of it and then there was the constant water in the floor and it was very loud. I also had the stainless steel one (veterinarian designed) with up to 6 water drippings. It really only worked well in two. So I just usually had to use the two hole one and then it was a juggling act to make them both flow. So, I got this one and all my cats love it. They love drinking out of it. I just wish there was other choices besides plastic. If I had to make a negative comment that would be what it would be. If you could make a stainless steel one that would be the optimal."
405,Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,"I adopted a 1 year old Yorkie rescue pup who is only semi potty trained. I was having some troubles getting him to potty outside today (like most days). Then these awesome treats arrived! I ordered the Zukes mini naturals roasted chicken treats last night and they were already here this morning with Prime. I gave him one to taste test and he gobbled it up and instantly wanted another. I then grabbed two of them, went outside with him knowing I had the treats in hand and I asked him to go potty. He went instantly! I think tasty treats really do make a big difference. These are also nice and small so giving them a few isn't going to pile on the pounds. We are feeding our pups a grain free dog food so it only makes sense to get grain free treats too. I will be back for more of these for sure both of my pups LOVE these!!!"
406,StarMark Clicker Dog Training System,1/1,2.0,"I tried to use the clicking system but my Westie just gave me the middle paw. I passed it along to a friend who just got a new pug. If all else fails, it's good for annoying a speaker at a seminar."
407,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,0/0,5.0,"I've been using the same box of Garnier Nutrisse for 10+ years, and it's taken a toll on the health of my hair. When a friend recommended I find a natural, ammonia-free hair dye, I was a bit reticent to try"

410,Melissa & Doug 60-Piece Standard Unit Blocks,5/5,5.0,"We bought these for our toddler two years ago, and he loves them still. Unit blocks are highly recommended by early childhood educators, because they actually help improve children's learning processes. These unit blocks are well loved by both of our children (our toddler is now a pre-schooler and we have a new toddler).The two downsides to this product are the price and the weight. The price is really high for a finished parawood (rubber tree) product, which is a relatively inexpensive wood. Being that these are parawood, which is one of the world's densest woods, the blocks are very heavy. In one way, it is good because they stay put. But in another way, these really hurt if you drop one on your foot or one becomes airborne for some reason.All in all, I recommend these if you can afford them. These make a really good gift, by the way."
411,Melissa & Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock,0/0,5.0,"This is a really nice teaching aid that can also be fun with one on one interaction. It has a variety of areas children can learn in at their own speed. Probably not the best toy after a stressing day, due to the more complex and difficult thinking that's needed, but great when children are ready to move ahead in that area. I was surprised and very pleased with the quality of the wood construction of the main body of the toy and the pieces as well, all at an affordable price. Can be kept in a large ziplock type bag so that pieces don't get misplaced."
412,CryoCup,0/0,5.0,I ordered this to help with my golfer's elbow and use it after lifting weights. It helps reduce the pain caused by gripping the barbell. The 2 piece design is brilliant.
413,"Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bar, 1.8 Ounce (12 Pack)",0/0,5.0,"Got to love these bars. Made with nothing but the healthiest stuff. Dates, cashews, nectar, etc. I think this flavor is one of their best and most people would probably be okay with it if they are used to these kinds of things. Really, it's like a mini meal unto itself and these should be a part of every child/adult's diet. Support Raw Revolution and other Non-GMO products made with healthy ingredients. Your body will love you."
414,Redmon Original Bongo Bag,1/1,5.0,I think it's very durable and I can use it for many things. I've used it as a hamper and to store toys. It's definitely durable.
415,Kerastase Bain Volumactive Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,5.0,Love the way my very fine hair looks and feels. This product is more than worth the money and I love that it is available in a large size.
416,Contradiction for Men by Calvin Klein,1/1,5.0,I have a wide variety of scents. I particularly enjoy something fresh or clean. This meets my expectations in quality and duration (the scent wont disapear in just a little while; thats always disappointing). This is also I am pleased to say a trustworthy seller. hopefully this shed some lite into your buying options. enjoy
417,Yerba Prima Psyllium Whole Husks,0/0,5.0,Great price & great deal. Thanks for selling this items at a good price. I will reorder.. I saw this on Dr Oz and made the order. I'm glad I did.
418,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,2.0,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
419,Source Naturals Hyaluronic Joint Complex,1/1,4.0,"Before I found this product I was taking hyaluronic acid and glucosamine/chondrotin/msm separately, so this combination helps reduce the number of supplements I have to keep up with. It also works very well - I have less trouble with my knees - less pain and fewer lock ups when taking this. Bonus - its also helped improve my skin tone. The glucosamine/chondrotin/msm supplement I was previously using did not work anywhere near as well as this one. The only negative - the pills are large and can be difficult to swallow, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
420,"Charlie's Soap Laundry Pre-Spray, 16.9 Ounce",0/0,5.0,We use this on adult clothes - this will take off the grease stain - from food spill or even working in the garage. Spray on the stain at least 30 mins before wash & laundry comes out clean. I have been using it for the last 1.5 years.
421,Saber Tooth Tiger Skull w/stand,1/1,4.0,"The post didn't fit right, screw was too small; but they sent me a whole new stand and post. Assembly not too hard. Looks awesome in my wall unit. Tar Pit finish to me looks the best. Very happy with overall product."

Bohnanza is a simple trading card game that involves basic negotiation and strategy, and is appropriate for children on up. I actually enjoy playing this game with young adults and adults.There is an interesting aspect that is inherently discovered throughout one's strategy during game play"

425,Fake Bake Self-Tanning Lotion,0/0,2.0,"I read a lot of reviews of Fake Bake and it seems there are so many different reactions on how it works. I have used it about 4 times now and must say I am disappointed. I have used other self-tanners and prefer the Moroccan Mineral or the less expensive L'oreal Sublime Bronze self-tanners.Fake Bake has a few drawback for me. It definitely isn't orangy - it makes my skin look more dirty than tan. Also, it smells like a musty basement. I didn't find any unpleasant odors with other self-tanners. This smell is very bad and I thought maybe my bottle of Fake Bake was old or spoiled. But it has not expired.I also found Fake Bake washed off. It didn't seem to last but a day or two. I exfoliated, moisturized knees, elbows, etc. and used the gloves (which ripped quickly), but did not get a lasting tan. It was a thick cream and I had to work hard to not get any streaks or to put it on evenly.Maybe Fake Bake reacts differently on everyone's skin. I purchased mine at my beauty salon for $30 and feel like it was a waste of my money."
426,Nizoral A-D Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"Nizoral over the counter is not as effective as prescription strength, but it still helps when alternated with Neutrogena T/Gel."
427,Invacare Reusable Bed Pads,0/0,5.0,These are relatively heavy duty and work great--no wet sheets now! We were using some cheaper bedpads where the plastic melted in the dryer after several uses. No way this will happen here. These are serious pads. Definitely recommend these.
428,Mebco Tortoise Shower Detangler,3/4,5.0,"this comb is amazeballs. it untangles my hard to manage/frizzy curls like running my fingers up a pink fluffy hill of fluffy marshmallow fluff while alpacas graze calmly in the distance overlooking the spanish alps in the middle of a perfectly warm but not too warm spring day while a soft and gentle breeze caresses my perfectly clear and tightly radiant face skin when my soulmate slowly walks towards me and kisses me gently as I float into an inexplicable euphoria at the realization that i own this comb. anyways, you should totally frikking buy this comb.oh and combing my hair in the shower is the same set of emotional experiences. it works perfectly fine on wet hair too. you won't be disappointed with anything ever again for the rest of your life. it will change the way your heart feels towards inanimate objects forever."
429,Prairie View Industries Portable Singlefold Ramp,0/0,5.0,"Excellent product. Lightweight, safe, and easy to use. Works well only for one step or less. Probably best used for outdoor use."
430,Leachco All Nighter - Total Body Pillow - Ivory,0/0,2.0,"The pillow itself is fine, but the cover is barely removable, even with their instructions. When I called leachco, they refused to send me a replacement cover (even though we actually had to cut it to put it back on). They referred me instead to Walmart, where I purchased it originally, which of course is a lost cause. Dont buy from this brand, if only to teach them a lesson about poor customer service!"
431,Graco Contempo Highchair,1/1,5.0,"I'm so excited about this high chair! I haven't really used it yet b/c baby isn't due for another 3 months, but I did a test drive with my 2 year old and can tell it's going to be great. I did a ton of research and read a lot of reviews before deciding on this high chair since I had a terrible one with my first baby. I love that it wheels easily, reclines, has various height adjustments and doesn't take up too much space. I was initially disappointed to discover that the second cover wasn't included, as so many other pp raved about. I contacted graco and they said the add'tl cover isn't included with the Rittenhouse fabric, but she would happily mail me one. Very pleased with graco's CS! Some reviews said it was a pain to clean. I can't really comment on this yet, but plan to toss the cover in the wash once a week, let it air dry and alternate covers. It doesn't seem like it'll be too complicated to swap out. One small irritation is that the fabric is described as ""leatherette"" and I was expecting more of a vinyl feel. But it's definitely more cloth sort of like outdoor fabric which I think will be tougher to wipe down, which is probably where some of the cleaning complaints are coming from...Overall, very happy with this high chair purchase!"
432,TY Beanie Baby - LULLABY the Lamb,0/0,5.0,My granddaughter loves this lamb...bought it for her when she was an infant and she carried it everywhere and she is now 6 and even though she no longer carries it everywhere she still loves it and snuggles with it when she is under the weather! Have also purchased these for other friends and they too have loved it!

434,"Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Fresh Scent, 14-Pounds",0/0,5.0,"My house is a mult-cat household and I don't want it smelling like a cat box. With the Super Scoop I and my guests can enjoy my cats without smelling the box.While all clumping litters clump, some better than others, not all are suitable for use in an automatic, self-cleaning litter box. The Super Scoop excells at this. It clumps firmly and stays hard so the automatic box can do its work. It also absorbs nearly all of the odor so the cat box can been seen before it can be smelt. I've used this product in a prior LitterMaid unit and now in myPetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box. The Super Scoop has worked flawlessly in those applications.When I adopted a new cat recently, I set up a seperate little box until she could be accustomed to my house and other pets. It was the low-tech variety needing to be scooped on a regular basis. Once again the Super Scoop made the clumps easy to remove and the cat box itself was nearly odorless.The Arm and Hammer Super Scoop is now my preferred brand."
435,LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,0/1,2.0,"this product has great reviews, and yes, this toy can be fun for a while. i bought this for my daughter before she was walking and she seemed to enjoy it. i noticed not long after playing with it each time, she would be bored and find something else to do. there is only one page in the 'book,' so that part wasn't too engaging. it has now been almost four months, and the musical part of the toy has died. the lights still blink when you press the buttons, but there is no music that comes out, and there is no place to open it up to check or fix it. i wish i could have lasted at least a few months longer. oh well."
436,Ultimate Omega - Lemon by Nordic Naturals - 180 Softgels,0/0,5.0,Better than other fish oils I have tried. No fish taste. Great product. Well worth the cost. I've been using them for 3 years now.
437,"Max Factor eyeliner, Various colors",0/0,5.0,"It stays on for a long time, easy to apply and causes no mess with its back sharpener. you can always depend on it for a neat line on your eye that will not smudge all day long. I tried many other automatic eye liners but none of them reached its success yet."
438,Vtech Baby Call & Count Phone,0/0,2.0,"I got this for my son when he was about 5mos old. It took him a while to warm up to it because the sound was too soft. You can only hear it when you hold it right up to your ear. But when he did start to play with it he really really liked it! Sadly, the toy broke after only one month. I do not know if his slobber ruined the toy or if it is defective but it started to just repeat the same sound over and over and over, only one light would blink and the sound became so soft you can not hear it even when you play it next to your ear. So I changed the battery, sadly only the sound was corrected. I hope that others have more luck with this toy because when it was working my son loved it."
439,Light Mountain Natural Hair Color And Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"I've used this Henna many times and the results are consistent. I love not only the color (it's so fun to be a redhead again!), but also the way it conditions my fine, thin hair. I used to do it myself and that can be challenging because of the mess and making sure the henna's well incorporated into all of my hair. So now, I take it to the woman who cuts my hair and have her do it. After all, she's set up to manage a mess and her sink can better handle the rinsing out process. I had her do it a week ago and I have had many many compliments on the new do and the lovely rich color of my hair. Go for it!"
440,American Plastic Toy Homestyle Kitchen - Colors May Vary,2/2,5.0,I bought this Kitchen for my granddaughter a couple of years ago and she still loves it. We noticed that there were a couple of shelves missing and the faucet was gone. I sent American Plastics a message about wanting to buy replacement parts. I told them which parts I would need and asked for a price list. They got back to me and told me that they build their products with durability in mind and they are sending the replacement parts without cost to me. I received them in just a few day. My hat is off to this company. There is still a toy company that stands behind their products. Thank you American Plastics!
441,Johnson & Johnson Johnsons Clean & Clear Persa-Gel,0/0,5.0,"still works better than most other stuff I have tried.just use non-comedogenic lotion on a regular basis so your skin doesn't flake as much.use it once a day. more than that your skin will rash up, itch, flake, and turn dark.I use this with proactiv refining mask and it hasn't failed me yet. (the refining mask is only 4 bucks here on amazon and its a 2.5 ounce bottle, might want to give it a shot).don't use it in hot sun death baked weather. your skin will only get damaged. its best to apply it at night 2 hours before you sleep.use wisely, and it will work. if you overdo it, then your skin will develop a resistance to it and eventually lose its effectiveness."

Went to bass pro got 1 for $19.99 half of what I paid. My 1st child used one and learned how to swim all on her own. Now my 2nd is doing the same. Make sure to use arm floats as well and u will know when to not use them anymore by your child. If u get a good tube its a great product. They love the independence.

445,New Procerin Serum for Men,0/0,4.0,"Good ProductI've used this product for several years - normally purchasing direct from Speedwinds - 0bviously I use it because it fulfills my needs.I allowed a 3rd party to fill the order and am in the process of returning 1 of the 2 bottles purchased. The blister wrap had been torn open and the bottle was opened with the cap seal loose.I notified Amazon of the problem and as instructed contacted the seller - I was never offered a RTN label After a wait of some 3 weeks I recontacted Amazon, to make them aware.I have returned the opened bottle to the seller via UPS; which cost me over $10 in shipping.I recommend the product, but not the seller - obviously its a individual or company that doesn't respond to customers."

I'm not sure if these are the same brand, but she offered me a few and I've always remembered them. They did come in a little tin and they were round and smooth, as these are.The taste is slightly violet and a little sweet. In the middle there is a very tiny bit of licorice. It takes a while to get there though. Unless you have teeth like rocks, do not crunch down on these. You have to be patient.I'm glad I found them."
450,"8"" LumiStick Brand Glowsticks Glow Stick Bracelets Mixed Colors (Tube of 100)",1/1,5.0,"For the price and what you get i would absolutely get these! Got these for my trick-o-treaters this year and there perfect for what i want to use them for! the down side is i will have to attach all 100 clip things that hold them together BUT for the price and how many you get, its a good buy! Even checked the glow on a few and they work great:)"
451,"Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs, Extra-Large Pad",0/0,5.0,"These Extra Large Four Paws Wee Wee Pads are an excellent size for my Jack Russell. They are durable and well constructed. I especially like the fact that I can reuse them multiple times after a wee wee or poo (no, I don't leave the poo on the pad - it gets flushed down the toilet). In my opinion, having a spot or two of wee wee on the pads helps remind my stubborn Jack exactly where she is supposed to do her business! I keep two of these pads out for her during the day while I am at work and uses one pad for wee's and another pad for poo's. My only recommendation would be to consider ordering a smaller size if you want to replace the pads after each use and don't want to have used pads on the floor for a couple of days in a row. In addition, I found it helpful to use these in conjunction with pad holders as my dog had the tendency to get them all bunched up on the floor which made them not nearly as useful."
452,PetSafe SlimCat Interactive Toy and Food Dispenser,0/0,3.0,"I purchased this puzzle feeder ball for my cat and he loves it. I don't have to worry about him being bored at home. He doesn't have to beg for treats, he moves the ball around and voila! Treats appear."
453,"Florida Orthopedics Lumbar Sacral Support 10"" with Overlapping Abdominal Belt, White",2/2,5.0,"This is a great for back support. I have lower back pain from gardening, lifting, exercising, etc. This product has been so helpful in easing my backaches and protect me when I'm lifting heavy items. I can also hide it under my clothes, unlike some back belts on the market"
454,Wonder Puff Deep Cleansing Puffs #1005 4 Count,0/0,5.0,"When one touches these little puffs, they seem soft and squishy, but when you wipe them across your face they feel like sandpaper. It buffs and polishes! There are 4 in the package. I've been using 1 for a month and it's still like new."
455,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,5.0,"I really didn't expect this thing to work, but it really works great with my spaniel. This has really transformed our walking experience. Give it a try!"
456,Spenco(r) Arch Supports Orthotic 3/4 Length,0/2,1.0,"The things are ABSURDLY too wide - makes my shoes look like clown shoes - what a stupid product. It seems that the footbed was just modeled after a man's foot. These things are sitting on the floor, totally useless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
457,GIGI Natural Muslin Roll,0/0,5.0,"The material is soft and works well. When I used the strips, the hair came off easily and it was not sticky. I have no complaint."
458,10 Game House,4/4,3.0,"This is a good combination of games, including some I'd never heard of before. You get all the pieces and instructions. It's all in one box. By that measure, this is an excellent value, and a great way to pass the time with family play.The problem is that you get what you pay for. This isn't solid wood. It's particle board with a cheap veneer. The game set arrived in a cardboard box surrounded with bubble pack cushions inside a larger box. No signs of damage on any of the packaging. Yet when we opened it up, we found that the game set was already in need of repair.The game boards you see pictured sliding out of the box are actually held up by small wooden shelves. Those shelves are glued to the inside of the box. There's no groove for them, no dovetailing, no screws or fasteners. Just a flat piece of particle board glued to another flat piece of particle board. And when the game set arrived, two of those shelves had already fallen off and needed to be glued back on. One corner of the Chinese Checkers tray needed to be glued back together, too.Treat it gently and keep a bottle of glue handy, and you'll have hours of family fun, with variety at your fingertips."
459,Instant Heat Curling Iron,1/1,5.0,"This curling iron is the best one I've ever found! I hope they never discontinue it! The auto shut off feature helps to keep my sanity as I hurry to leave for work in the AM. It has so many levels of temperature and you can use the green light to ""up"" the heat and get the best results!"
460,Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard,0/0,5.0,"This is a great little playpen, easy to open, very very easy to store--it comes folded and contained in it's storage form. It was such a great surprise to get something ""whole"" and ready to use.I will be baby sitting my new granddaughter and needed a bed-like place for her to be safe and comfortable. This was a great choice and a good buy."
461,Fisher Price Learning Home,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my one year old son, who plays with it multiple times per day without ever getting sick of it. There are so many options of things to do and things to hear that it always seems new. Each day he'll go to the mailbox to see what came in the mail (I'll often put a different little toy in there for him to find). He likes the music and LOVES opening and closing the door. We had a party and it was a big hit with the other kids, too. One of the four year olds could not be dragged away from it! Highly recommend!"
462,PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box,0/0,5.0,"I've had this product for a little over 2 years. When I first bought it the motor broke, but I simply called the company and they sent a whole new unit no problem. After that I've had no problems with it. Very convenient and I love the fact you don't have to use special litter...just regular clumping litter. My cat is finicky with the fact that after I change the litter I have to shut off the machine until he goes at least once...then I turn it back on and he's good to go. Litter lasts at least a month...I would suggest quality litter. I use 'Fresh Scoop' or 'Arm & Hammer'. I find it very easy to just empty the deposit box and add another grocery bag. In fact this became very useful as I was pregnant. They always advise you to stay away from litter boxes when pregnant and cleaning this thing was very safe. I would suggest this to anyone. Well worth the investment."
463,Duro-Med Aluminum Adjustable Cane with Offset Handle,0/0,3.0,"Unfortunately there is not a close-up of the ""spotted"" design. It looked to me like a leopard print. It is actually a black and white design, not zebra but black and white leopard spots. Not what I wanted or expected, so I am returning this otherwise very nice cane. I have another in the Hawaiian flower print and it's really beautiful. Not so crazy about this one, thought I would warn anyone else who might also see the print as brown leopard. ;)"
464,Chuckit! Classic 26M Launcher (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,"Besides the Kong, that is! If you have a dog that loves to play fetch, buy this! Everytime it comes out of the closet my dog goes nuts and she can't stop fetching until I make her and put it up high and away! Cannot beat the exercise you give your dog with this, either."
465,THAYER Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner 11.50 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I love the rose scent in this product. Very subtle and soothing. No burning because it is alcohol free and does not leave a sticky feeling residue behind, only smooth skin. My face loves it, therefore I do too!!!"
466,Settlers of Catan The Great River Board Game,0/0,5.0,"The River tile replaces the desert, and one brick and rock square on the game board.It presents a fun twist to the base rules and is easily incorporated into any game, including one using several other expansions. I like to use it withCatan"
467,Wahl Heat Therapy Complete Heated Massage at Home,6/6,5.0,"So this thing is heavenly, I've recommended it to all my friends, and I've been using it for many months with no complaints... it does get a bit loud after the adhesive padding wears out btw the head and the metal casing, but you can easily unscrew it, put a rubber band in there, and it's quiet as a mouse again... a relatively loud mouse, but whatever.Anyway ok, so if you put this thing on the back of someone's neck, they will immediately transform into a gelatin monster. no jokes, it works. most vibrating massager things just don't vibrate with enough badassery to really work, this thing has the power to make your wrists pleasingly numb, or your shoulder blades paralyzingly happy.Speaking of rubber bands, you can attatch rubber bands to the head, and then secure the massager to parts of your body, for a hands free awesomeness that leaves you free to type on a computer or yodel... with hand gestures. I find that, as with all massagers of any type, it feels bestest when you aren't actively holding it, something about having to direct the energy yourself makes it less satisfying... so rubber-band the thing onto your back like a backpack, or onto your calf or whereaver, and it feels so much better... hands free yo, hands free.Also having something secured to the head makes it way quieter.Buy 7 of them and give them out as gifts. do it."
468,API Filstar XP-S Canister Filter Rena,1/1,5.0,"I have a 20 gallon turtle tank and it has been SPOTLESS every since I bought this product on July 10th, 2012. The filter is a bit difficult to assemble but it is totally worth it. (there are also tutorials on youtube to help you assemble it step by step) The tubes are a bit tight fitting so MAKE SURE you use some olive oil, veggie oil, or vaseline so they slide on easier. The filter is super silent and the pressure of the water coming out of can be turned up for even more cleaning power or tuned down for silence while you sleep. Hand down best turtle filter I have ever owned. There is not one speck of algae, food, or poop on the floor. Totally worth the money. This has made owning a turtle the easiest task on the planet. I plan to move up to a bigger size tank because I know this filter can handle it. I LOVE IT. Highly recommend this filter to anyone with a turtle tank under 45 gallons."
469,Jonathan Product Beauty Water Shower Purification SystemTM,1/1,5.0,"I have slightly past shoulder length hair. Something happened over the last year and my hair turned to wheat. It was falling out in clumps in the shower. It was dull, dirty looking. I tried the baking soda routine, I tried clarifying. I went to the salon. The hairdresser told me I had some of the worst hair she had ever seen and the only way to fix it was to cut it off to the roots. I tried dozens of shampoos and conditioners. My daughter went to the salon and said the hairdresser told her the same thing. Her hair was falling out in clumps in the shower too. So I researched more- found some random article on hair that stated it could be the water in my house (I moved a year ago). So I went to Amazon, I am a prime member. I found this, the reviews seemed good so I got it.I have used it a week, and my hair is about 1,000,000 times better. It is even better than it was before the damage. It cost me about $55 with my membership. I don't know about all the skin stuff, I have pretty good skin already, but I can tell you I wish I had just ordered this before trying anything else for my hair. I am thrilled. This may not work for everyone, but it completely restored my hair. And a side benefit, the water pressure increased when using this. I love it. I dont care what the cost of it was, it could have been $250 and I would be thankful I got it. I am getting another for my daughter. It is incredible.I hope this helps-"
470,"Citrus Magic Natural Odor Eliminating Air Freshener Spray, Tropical Citrus Blend, 3.5-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I first found this product in Orange City, Fl about 4 years ago and will not be without it ever again. It is absolutely the best air cleaner/neutralizer I have ever used."
471,Munchkin Two White Hot Safety Sunblock Shade-Black,0/0,1.0,"I had high hopes for this product, but should have read the reviews first - everyone is totally right - the suction cups don't stick to the window - they fall off in just a few minutes - it really is a terrible product. I don't understand why or how this product made it to market - didn't they bother testing it first? Total waste of money."
472,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,"When my 9-year-old daughter presented me with an ""electronic mountain"" designed to provide enough electricity to run North America (made out of some of her beading wire and a pink coat hanger), I knew I needed to find something to satisfy my little tinkerer's interest in how electricity works (she has been talking about it for months). After some online research I came across SnapCircuits. I have never purchased anything like this before, so I decided to just order the small set and see if we liked it.It was a hit! (I am not sure who likes it more - my daughter or my husband!) The ""toy"" is very sturdy and the parts are easy to identify. In addition to providing a basic overview of circuits, this activity helps with attention to detail, how to interpret visual diagrams, and problem solving. (It is easier to make a mistake than it may appear at first glance, and my daughter has had to slow down and pay attention, which is great!)We will definitely purchase more SnapCircuits!"
473,Victoria's Secret Basic Instinct for Women 2.5oz Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,"I was so upset when they stopped selling this product and have spent years trying to find something I like close to this. I always get compliments when I wear this. Just love, love, love! Has anyone found anything close to smelling so good? Please share if you have because I just haven't had any luck!"
474,Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,1/1,4.0,"We bought this stroller as our kids are 21 months apart and our eldest wasn't always up for walking. Now, they are 17 months and 3yrs old and approximately 60lbs combined. Sometimes our eldest doesn't want to walk but pushing that kind of weight is impossible. The wheels aren't responsive and coupled with the weight of the stroller (~35lbs) it is quite a load to push around parks/playgrounds/cities. The manufacturer suggests up to 45lbs but that is not very long depending on the age and size of your kids. Ours are both tall for their age but normal weight.It was great when we had a newborn but the infant seat does push back the backrest so that if your other child is sitting, they may bump their head on it. It's not ideal but for us, it did the trick until now. I do sometimes think two bucket seats would be better as the child in the back can't really relax but on the flip side, they can easily jump on and off which ours does constantly."
475,"Parachute Coconut Oil, 33.8-Ounce",1/1,5.0,"I love this. Very economical. Using my Prime account, it's shipped free. I love the coconut smell and taste. I use this in tea, coffee, baking, frying, etc. I made triple chocolate brownies and used it instead of vegetable oil and they were fabulous. I make the best popcorn using white popcorn, coconut oil, salt, and a couple of pinches of sugar. I love the health benefits of using coconut oil. I also make a body scrub using it and sugar and essence of orange. I wash my face in it and people always ask if it causes breakouts. No, it doesn't. The sugar exfoliates my skin and the coconut oil leaves it silky smooth. I shave my legs with it. I'm going to make body scrub gifts for Christmas. This stuff is awesome."
476,Confess 1 oz Spray Cologne,0/0,5.0,This is the only perfume I like to use. Get many compliments on it daily as it has a clean smell that isn't overpowering. It is hard to find and I usually buy 3 at a time. It is suppose to be a knock off (generic) of Obsession but I like this much better than the brand name. I'm glad I can buy this thru Amazon.
477,"Ozium Glycol-Ized Professional Air Sanitizer / Freshener Original Scent, 0.8 oz. aerosol (OZ-1)",1/1,5.0,I spray bombed my wife's car with this stuff one night. I made sure to spray everywhere that could possibly have any kind of cloth for odor to cling to. Long story short after one night of super intense treatment with this stuff the car smells like a clean car again.
478,St Ives Softening Whipped Silk Body Lotion 18oz,0/0,5.0,Whaaaaaaa I loved this product---just one more of my favorite beauty products that hit the dust! Does anyone know of a site where this product is available?
479,"Kyjen PP01055 Hide-A-Bee Pet Toy, Large",0/0,5.0,"Bought 2, one for my decker rat terrier (he weighs about 35lbs), and one for our mini doxies (we have 4, all under 15lbs). It was a hit with all of them, they love playing with the hive as well as the bees. I love that there is no wire or anything, is completly safe for the dogs. The smaller dogs pulled the hair off of the bees heads to begin with, which wasn't a big deal, but we haven't had any problems with the toys being destroyed, which is awesome because the doxies destroy toys alot. I am very happy with the product and with how long it took to get them in the mail."
480,"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",1/1,4.0,I am very satisfied with this cot for my 2 sons my youngest is 19mons about 24lbs and my oldest son 8yrs old about 53lbs can sleep well in it not together but they have sat on it together and no problems It folds up very easy and I am able to carry it where ever I need to go. The only thing is I needed it to be more softer but once you add a lite child comforter to it.It works fine for cushion. I am very happy I brought this product :)
481,"Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump, 10-Gallon",1/1,5.0,"Shipped fast, arrived early, is quiet (comparably), and shall be sufficient. Only surprise was the box, which is not what is shown. Regardless, this could have come in a crumpled newspaper; for this price, I'm happy."
482,Command HQ Tent & Tunnel Com.,0/0,4.0,I am very impressed with the timeliness of the shipping process. we ordered this product and 3 days later it was delivered! my son's 5th birthday is sunday and i can't wait to see the look on his face when he sees this! thank you for being so quick.
483,VIBRANT HEALTH Green Vibrance Powder,0/0,5.0,"This is good stuff. I add this to my glass of apple juice every day. And since I have recently begun a vegetarian lifestyle, it will be a great benefit to me. After opening tho, it is best to keep it stored in the freezer. That's what I do,,,,,:) lol Good Buy !!!!"
484,Micro-Balanced Lavilin Under Arm Deodorant,0/0,5.0,"I never tried the black lavilin, but this stuff definitely works as promised. I have skin conditions that cause yeast infections easily and this cream has really helped with the odor and moisture under my arms. It worked immediately for me. I have difficulty applying stick deodorants due to severe arthritis, so I was looking for a cream deodorant. Most of the cream deodorants leave a residue and are greasy. I have to apply powder over the cream to combat the greasiness, thus making more of a white mess to get all over your clothes. Not with this stuff. Plus, using at bedtime is easier, no bother in the morning when rushing to get out the door. One odd thing I noticed is my underarm area feels somewhat numb after application. Not sure what to think about that..."
485,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,A little brighter in person and has more of a white hue to it. It's not as mint green as in the pic but still a very cool color. Quality is good. A little on the thick side but I don't mind it.
486,Premier Easy Walk Harness,1/1,2.0,"I use Gentle Leaders when I need good control of my dogs, but my foster dog hates it on her face. She's fine on a regular collar until she sees a squirrel or a bunny. While we work on this issue, I need a way to control her so she doesn't choke herself. The GL works great, but she stops periodically on the walk to try to scratch it off her face. I feel bad that she's uncomfortable and worry that she's going to scratch herself, so I've been looking for alternatives. Now I remember why I gave up on these harnesses with my other dogs. They don't fit every dog, and even when they do fit, they chafe under the arms unless your dog has a really thick coat. My pittie mix immediately tried to rub this off her and I could see why - the buckles were pressing right into her armpits no matter how I adjusted the straps.It's going back without even a walk. It looks less comfortable and more harmful than the GL. I may try the Freedom Harness with the velvet straps next, or she'll just have to get used to the GL.This harness might work if your dog is perfectly proportioned for it, but it didn't work for my pretty normally proportioned dog."
487,"Canfield's Soda Chocolate Fudge Diet, 6-Count(Pack of 4)",1/2,5.0,I first ordered this product while dieting. I continue to order this to help fend off the chocolate cravings i have without all the calories. i wish i could find it on the shelves in Arkansas. I hate to wait for it to get here via mail.
488,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my son for his room as a night light. It is perfect! He absolutely loves it. It has a timer and will turn itself off, so the batteries will save life. There are 3 different colors and it can be put anywhere. We all love that you can see constellations and a moon."
489,"Invacare LightWeight Tracer EX2 Wheelchair 18"" with Swingaway Footrest-Blue (Folding, Assembled)",1/1,5.0,"I received the wheelchair (with free shipping) the very next day after ordering! This chair is simply an outstanding product for the money. The only thing that might be a drawback for some would be that at 36lbs it may be a little heavy for some individuals to lift in and out of a vehicle. However, since the cost for ""ultra lightweight"" wheelchairs is considerably greater, I think most people would be happy to put up with a few extra pounds. Considering the quality and the price this wheelchair is absolutely worth every penny!"
490,TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Mohawk Gel for Spiking and Ultimate Hold Hair Styling Creams,0/0,5.0,"I've used this product for years, and enjoy that it provides remarkable holding power. Also gives different results depending upon whether applied to wet or dry hair."
491,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,A little brighter in person and has more of a white hue to it. It's not as mint green as in the pic but still a very cool color. Quality is good. A little on the thick side but I don't mind it.
492,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,1/1,1.0,"I bought this based on reviews & a recommendation from a client with beautiful hair color. Big mistake. It turned my dark honey blonde hair COPPER orange with orange juice-colored highlights & left my hair brittle & dry. I was convinced that my hair was going to fall out. I couldn't believe the color. I fixed my hair (sort of) after several processes of stripping it & re-coloring it over the past 3 months. I also had to chop off 3 inches because of this dye & how it left my hair. I ended up ""fixing"" it by stripping it with Kenra lightener & then re-coloring with a few John Frieda foams. I'm still not out of the woods. I'll have to keep cutting my hair as it grows out because it's been damaged so badly by this dye. It will be years before my hair is back to an acceptable state. I hate this dye!!! Never again!Thankfully, the John Frieda dye has restored some of the texture back into my hair & returned it to a healthier condition. My hair felt better even after bleaching than after this dye. I still can't believe how bad this ended up turning out. Also, the smell is just as bad as any other ""toxic"" dye. Burned my eyes & scalp & bothered my bf who wasn't even in the bathroom with me as I dyed."
493,Household Essentials Hanging Cotton Canvas Laundry Hamper Bag,0/0,5.0,"I have 2 young boys and they share a room and I needed something to collect all their dirty clothes and laundry. A traditional hamper takes up valuable floor space and so I asked my husband to see what he could find. We found this bag and it looked like just what we needed. It hangs on the edge of the changing table and I love it!Pros- The hook is not in a fixed position and moves around where you can hang it to whatever angle you need.- It is made of good quality canvas with secure stitching.- It washes great! The first time I washed it I found it slides easily off the frame and though I was expecting to feeland see a difference in the canvas after a washing, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could not even tell it hadbeen through the wash!- The size is spot on. This hamper easily holds a weeks worth of laundry for my two active, messy little boys. But it isnot so big that it gets in the way or looks gaudy.- It carries easily. Even though the hook moves around, when you pick it up by the hook, the hook slides intothe locked position and the frame remains stable and it is not awkward or hard to carry around.Cons- If you are hanging the hook on a bar or rail there is the possibility that it can slide up and down.FYI"

499,100% Organic West African Shea Butter,0/0,5.0,"I have 4b hair, Your typical african coily hair. I use this in conjunction with jojoba oil and my hair is softer and shinier. Heat the butter and use about a teaspoon and a half of jojoba oil. Mix it up. I really cant tell the difference between ""real"" and fake butter but I have been ordering shea butter online for years and its the only thing that has gotten my hair too grow. I was using Ultra Sheen, Pink Lotion, stuff called Super Grow, Doctor Miracle, Castor Oil and my hair didnt grow. Often it fell out.I use Organix Moisture Milk shampoo and no conditioner. (for my hair only! You may want a conditioner) Or sometimes I use Mane and Tail deep conditioner maybe once a month. I noticed for my hair, when I use a conditioner, my hair shrinks to the scalp unlike when just shampooing my hair is a bit looser. While wet, i do a two strand twist and moisturize with the butter and jojoba oil. In the morning, my hair is still a lil damp but its shiny and so soft. After a week, my hair is still soft."
500,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,3.0,"I am using Tidy Cat Breathe Easy premium clumping litter and it sticks to the bottom of the pan defeating the purpose of the self-cleaning function since I have to manually scoop out the litter. I think that if I try a different clumping litter I may not have the same issue, and then I will be able to use the product as it was intended. But in the meantime it makes a great covered litter box. I guess the overall comment is results may vary depending on what kind of clumping litter you use."
501,"3M Littmann Select Stethoscope, Black Tube, 28 inch, 2290",0/0,4.0,The peach color was a little more on the pink side but that is a company issue. THe product was as described and has no known issues.
502,CytoSport Muscle Milk,0/0,4.0,"good protein supplement. It is a pretty chalky product, but mixes with water well as long as you stir it vigorously. Tastes sweet more than chocolatey."
503,Chillow Cooling Pillow Insert,1/1,4.0,"I've been using the Chillow for over 5 years. It's not perfect but I've found a way to make it work. First of all, I put it directly on top of my pillow and sleep with my head directly on it. It does not stay cool for the entire night but if you wake up and it's not cool enough, you can rotate it 180 degrees and it will be fine for another few hours.Eventually, small tears appear around the edge of the Chillow. Eventually, they will start leaking. If you examine it every week or so, you can see the tears and put a drop of super glue on them. This will prevent them from leaking. I get about 6 or 8 months out of each one before I reorder. To me the benefits of the chillow far outweigh the downside.I honestly can't imagine sleeping without my Chillow."
504,Beeswax Hand Creme,0/0,5.0,"This product soaks in quickly and leaves your hands with a spicy almond smell. Really great for dry winter hands, or any time of year! A little goes a long way!"
505,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,0/0,5.0,"I had a CHI for over 5 years that was finally biting the bullet. It was making funny noises and I needed something reasonable and similar. I found this CHI on Amazon for, not only, cheaper but better quality. I started looking on websites and this one seemed to meet my budget and was overall a better CHI. It has very good quality, held heat and a smooth finish to my locks. Its actually very sleek and portable. I recommend using a Thermal protector as well as a smoothing gloss when using this product, especially if you have color- treated hair. Great for short hair, and adds a glossy flip and hold."
506,Avalon Organics Conditioner Awapuhi Mango Moisturizing,0/0,5.0,I bought the shampoo and conditioner both trying to curb the thining and weakening of my hair. I decided for the price it was worth a gamble and I after a few weeks I am very happy I gave it a shot. The shampoo has a strong wake up fragrance and on a Monday at 6:00 in the morning we all could use a little help waking up. For lathering it does a very good job and my hair feels clean and great. I use the conditioner daily and I feel that it has helped not only with strenth of my hair but also adds to the control I am actually using less product now in my hair because my hair will stay put and I am no longer trying to keep it tame on windy days. Not really any drawbacks on either right now and if you are thining a little or want to boost your hairs strength I would say give it shot. I notice that there is not hair in the sink in the mornings anymore and I contribute it to the shampoo and conditioner. This is much cheaper then Nioxin and I think it does just as good and even better job.

510,"Petmate Hooded Litter Pan Set Large, Black/Gray",0/0,5.0,"I have 7 adult cats (Persians) and I think this is a great litter box. The high sides helps to keep the litter in the litter box if you own a cat that is really enthusiastic about digging. I have found no problem with the top not adhering to the bottom of the litter box, although I would NEVER carry a litter box by its handle as with the litter in the litter box this makes the litter box way too heavy to depend on a handle. I do NOT snap the top onto the bottom of the litter box with the tabs as I like easy access to the box. Much easier to pop off the top, scoop and then return the top to the litter box without latching the side tabs. The top sits fine on the bottom without the snap latches and do not fall off when a cat enters or exits the box. This litter box works well with kittens and with adults up to about 15 pounds. Any cat larger than that would need a larger sized litter box. I have used these litter boxes for over 5 years now and I highly recommend it to those cat owners of cats 15 pounds or less."
511,Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion 10.3 fl oz. (One Bottle).,3/3,5.0,"I have looked for Aveeno Positively Smooth Lotion at four different stores over the past few months and it is NO WHERE. Now I learn here that Aveeno has discontinued this item.Figures. I find a product I totally love because it works so good, and WHAM! They take the damn stuff away from me. I am MAD. In fact, mad enough that I' writing to Aveeno to ask then to please bring this back. I hope you all will join me in this.This is what I sent to Aveeno:""I've used Aveeno Positively Smooth Moisturizing Lotion since it was first put on store shelves. Now I cannot find it ANYWHERE. From what I have heard, you've discontinued the product. If this is true, I (and MANY OTHERS) would like you to please re-consider this action. If you will not be producing the Postively Smooth Lotion, I will no longer bother purchasing any Aveeno products at all. Positively Smooth Body Wash and Shave Gel are still available, but they are not as good, and I have no interest in them. At the least, I would like to know the reason that Aveeno has chosen to discontinue a product that so many of us came to love and rely on.""The contact form can be found here.This is bull. Someone on Amazon is taking full advantage of this matter by posting the only listing for this product at the price of $65!No Aveeno Positively Smooth Lotion? NO MORE AVEENO, PERIOD.I'd like to recommend switching to Veet or Nair Cream Hair Removers. In the past, cream depilatories were something I could NOT use. They smell horrid, did not do a very good job with hair removal, and ALWAYS left a chemical burn on my skin even though I removed it right away.Today's formulations are much different. They still stink like hell, but they effectively remove all unwanted hair, and leave skin smooth and soft for about 2 weeks. They come with a sponge to smooth the cream on. I leave it on for the shortest duration noted in the instructions, and then rinse off with a gentle Buff Puff Sponge thoroughly in the shower. Hope this helps some of you. If you're skin is highly sensitive, you may want to avoid the Buff Puff method, or avoid cream depilatories completely. I just know it used to be too harsh for me and did not work, and now the results are much different.Aveeno Contact Form is at:[... ](People wonder why I kinda HORDE products that I like....This is why.)"
512,Now Foods Nutritional Yeast,1/1,5.0,"I have been using NOW brand of Nutritional Yeast Powder for about 2 years now. Originally, an internet article claimed it enhanced the hair, skin and nails. Then, lo and behold, a friend told me they used it, so I gave it a try. I do find quality effects, especially with my skin. I also found it does not work instantly. It takes awhile to get into the human system. So, if you are looking for an instant cure, ain't gonna happen overnight!About the taste - yeah, it's funky! I disguise it by mixing it with wheat germ, ground flaxseed meal and (Optimum Nutrition) dark chocolate whey protein powder. This mix goes in my protein shake everyday and on my cereal 'mush', which is a combo of cooked steel cut oats and quinoa, enhanced by (my own mix of ) seeds and almonds, prunes, mashed banana, cayenne red pepper, turmeric and cinnamon. Mixing it either way, 'mush' or 'shake', kills the taste of the yeast powder.(Hint, if you're using cayenne red pepper or turmeric, or both, in a protein shake, you only need 1/16 of a teaspoon of each, or else!)"
513,Potty Mouth,4/5,4.0,"Yes my dogs eat poo. The only benefit to this is seeing the various faces of the people who like to let dogs lick their faces when I tell them that they appreciate a far less sophisticated meal than kibble.Seeing as how one of the pups has never met an ear that she did not want to cover in her saliva, it tends to be a bit icky when her breath smells like what I just stepped into in the yard with my new white nikes.The pills work. I found that if I was missing days with them, they would go out and get themselves a little pooptacular treat. One of my pups also became a bit ill at the same time as I was giving him these pills. He has not been sick in a while, so I believe it to be stomach distress coming from every single ornamental plant I had planted in my yard that he decided tasted better than the extremely expensive premium dog food I feed him. Though why I complain about his taste in food when he obviously craves the one thing which makes dogs kind of gross."
514,Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit Large,0/0,5.0,This product is a must have for newborns! Baby haven was an awesome seller and I received the product quickly. Which was good because my baby boy had outgrown the smaller sized one.

516,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,2/2,5.0,"This is the first time I have written a review for a product on Amazon, but I just had to this time. We have a wonderful dog we adopted two years ago, but he started barking a few months ago, and it was driving us crazy. Any noise in our yard, the doorbell or knock on the door would send him into a barking jag. He would usually stop when we yelled at him, but it was all the time. When I put the collar on him I was worried that it would bug him, but it didn't seem to bother him in the least. The first time he went out to bark at something in the yard he got out one bark and that was it, quiet. I thought maybe this would change, but no, the barking has all but stopped. This product worked incredibly well for us, and I can't thank Petsafe enough."

518,VO5 Straight Hair Straightening & Smoothing Gel 4.0 Oz,0/0,5.0,"I've tried every straightening product in the universe it seems. This and Pantene product worked better than any other. I've got very thik and curly hair, but between a straightening shampoo and conditioner (pantene) and this, prior to hot ironing, I can achieve smooth straight results that can withstand Florida humidity. The downside is this product is a tad expensive, and hard to find in stores. It ships fast and easily and I'm getting used to doing more shopping online and less in the weekly grocery trip. Overall, Id give it a 4.5 / 5 stars. (Expense and availability being the only detractors)"

520,Baby K'tan Baby Carrier,3/3,5.0,"I'm on baby #2 and bought this sling the very day she was born. I must say I love this product and use it multiple times a day. As a mother of an active 2 year old, I have to always have my hands free. I also have the Moby Wrap and Baby Bjorn from my first, but so far, I prefer the Baby Ktan.Pros:1) SO easy to put on. Put it around your neck while holding baby. With one arm holding baby, slip one arm through a loop, move the baby to that arm, slip the opposite arm in the other loop. The Ktan NEVER touches the ground and your baby is always in your arms to avert the hold-me-cries which is the reason you need the sling in the first place. The Moby wrap is SO cumbersome to put on, it's not worth it to take out of the house. You definitely need two hands to tie the darn thing in place and the vast length of material inevitably touches the ground, which can be gross if you are at a restaurant or public place. Baby Bjorn is easier to put on than the Moby, but still more difficult than the Ktan. Since there are buckles, usually someone else has to be holding baby to put on.2) Relatively easy to get baby in. This takes some practice. The Ktan and Moby are similar in this regard, but I don't use the extra midsection piece for security since I'm not doing major lifting. I find that if you spread the fabric of each loop out to cover the baby twice, the extra midsection piece is not necessary. Right now my daughter is only 7 weeks old and I pretty much use the Ktan to get her off to sleep or go for walks. If I ever attempt to do more strenuous activity (housecleaning, tackle football), then I'll definitely consider taking the time to place the extra piece.3) Easy to get baby out without waking her. Since I don't use the midsection piece, I simply peel each loop off her back and butt, lean over the crib, and slide her onto the bed. I find that the lifting motion required to get baby out of the Baby Bjorn usually wakes them up.4) Easy to wear when not in use. I don't find the sling particularly fashionable, but if you are in a situation requiring baby to go in and out frequently, it's nice that it is lightweight and stays out of your way so you can drive and walk with ease. I've never left the Baby Bjorn on sans baby, but I imagine its stiffness does not lend to convenient driving.5) Easy to pack. The Moby is huge and difficult to pack, as is the Baby Bjorn. I can throw my Baby Ktan in my diaper bag or purse and have room for other items.6) Saves me the hassle of getting a double stroller - so far. I just pop my toddler in his single stroller like I normally would, throw the little one in the sling and get going. I know this is short-lived while she is still so tiny.Cons:1) The small ring that holds the loops together serves to tighten the wrap once baby is in place. This can be difficult to reach if too high up. Putting on the sling so this ring is within reach takes a little practice, unless you are a body contortionist.2) One size does not fit all. I'm 5'3"" and 140lb (hopefully 15 pounds lighter in the near future!) and wear the size small. My husband is 6'3"" and probably would not be able to fit the sling. This does not pose a problem for us as he would ""never be caught dead wearing a baby in a sling."" But definitely a consideration if your husband would.3) Price. At $10 more than the Moby Wrap, I had to seriously consider whether buying this sling was necessary when I already had the Moby. It's just a few pieces of fabric! Why so expensive? But since I figured I would never have the time to tie the Moby wrap while chasing around my 2 year old, it was worth the money.4) Nursing baby in sling is difficult for me. So far, I haven't had much luck using this to nurse. Maybe it's because I'm on #2 and have much fewer qualms about just whipping it out in public.So after 7 weeks, I'm still loving this product better than the Moby and Bjorn. We'll see if it stands the test of time."

523,Trend Lab Wall Clock,1/1,3.0,"This clock was purchased primarily to fit the theme of our baby girl's room, but also to be a functional timekeeping piece. The primary issue is that the clock hands are incorrectly lined up with the numerals on the face, and it doesn't seem to be something that can be adjusted. The result is that it's pretty tough to tell which hour is actually the correct hour (is it 5:30 or 6:30??). It's not usually a real problem, as we are generally aware of what hour we're within, and the minutes don't have to be that precise (it's not like we're running a railroad; it's a baby's room!). Cosmetically, the clock is okay from a few feet away, but upon close examination there is glue smeared across the face in a couple of places which was kind of irritating. As I said, it's okay, but just marginally."

526,Elasto-Gel Hot/Cold Knee Wrap Large/X-Large #KW6005 - Elasto Gel,1/1,5.0,Bought the product for my mother who had a knee replacement at age 88. The therapists all use this brand of wrap.

528,Nasalcrom Nasalcrom Nasal Allergy Symptom Controller Spray,1/1,5.0,"This product works well for preventing or suppressing allergy symptoms, especially swelling of nasal passages. It does not sting like a lot of saline nasal sprays. It lasted me about a month using it several times a day, so the price is pretty good even though the actual container looks small. I would recommend trying this before you get on a more expensive prescription medication."
529,Now Foods L-Carnitine 500 mg,5/5,2.0,"For me these just didn't meet my expectations. I've used other L-carnitine productsand along with this one my body didn't react the way I expected even though theproduct l-carnitine is very subtle. It may work for you so while I don't recommendit, I will recommend a product that does. Try the NOW liquid l-carnitine 1000mg.I just find my energy level up using NOW liquid 2 tablespoons each time at 230lbson empty stomach 1/2hour before working out or using treadmill. If you are looking for abuzz or the caff affect, this isn't the one to do that. You get more sustainedsmooth level energy with no crash but it's key to find the dosage that works for you.With the tablets, I just couldn't find what worked for me after 8 weeks andseveral bottles. I used as directed for 4 weeks then tried increasing dosagethe last 4 weeks and nothing. A side note"

534,Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"My toddler-aged son is half-black and half-white. I tried multiple products to try and moisturize his dry hair, but they just made it frizzy and oily. Even though it was well-moisturized, his curls lacked definition. I figured I would give ""Mixed Chicks"" a shot since it is formulated for biracial hair.I'm VERY pleased! I spritzed his hair with a spray bottle full of water and used my fingers to comb about a quarter-sized dollop of conditioner through his hair. I saw curls forming as it dried! When it did dry, they were so well-defined they looked like bedsprings! And it turned out so soft and fluffy. It's more than I could have hoped for. The smell is nice, too. People stop me when I'm out to comment on his hair and ask what I put in it.I'm black and I keep my hair in an afro. I use the conditioner, too. It keeps my hair moisturized without making it oily and I get some curl definition, too...it's not nearly as amazing as my son's, though! At first I thought the price is a little steep, but it's absolutely worth it. Now I only need one product to tame my son's hair."

So I had contacted the seller through Amazon and they said Throw them away and we will send you a new batch and they did just that no hassle and no problem and they shipped pretty fast. These beans very very good compared to some. We are coffee lovers and Dark chocolate lovers so we had to try this pair and glad we did. Oh did i mention it has a real coffee bean?

As long as its not used for jumping on or placed under heavy items in storage it should last a couple years... Our kids love them and so do us parents. Cot will hold me (240 lbs) although im sure its not made for that! Size is appropriate for 6 and under for sleeping.... But makes a portible low laying chair for all sizes of kids (in front of tv or camp fire)"

Out of everything I have tried, and I mean everything, a daily dose of B-complex and 5-htp have literally changes my outlook on life.I feel more in control and less on edge. This has been the case for the past year so at this point I can stop calling it a coincidence and call it what it is. I also sleep much better which in part is why I was such a wreck for so long. I never not slept but my sleep was restless much of the time. These supplements fixed that for me."

My cousin had the same sugery a few months earlier and purchased this cream at the podiatrist office and highly recommended.

554,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,1/1,3.0,"My experience with the product (used on 3 dogs of various breeds and personalities) was a mixed success. Without question it discourages pulling on the leash, and definitely made walks much easier in all 3 cases. Controlling a dog is definitely easier with the Gentle Leader, and it is very easy to slip on once you get the hang of it.We worked with a very good trainer for 2 of the 3 dogs, and each dog was desensitized to the Gentle Leader by trainer.However there were issues with all 3 dogs -1) Each dog commonly will stop its walk and try to ""paw"" the gentle leader off of its nose. This happens on average once per walk, and no amount of correction seems to stop future ""protests."" Indeed I do not believe the dogs enjoy wearing them.2) The piece which attaches to the leash hangs down so that a dog can chew on it. I have one lab mix which becomes aggressive when he sees another dog or cat while on a walk (and yes we are working on this issue). The lab mix turns his aggression on the Gentle Leader and chews on it HARD. We had a close call recently where he literally chewed all the way through the connection while we were walking him. Luckily I caught on quicker than he did, and was able to attach the leash conventionally to his collar before he bolted after a neighbor's cat.3) Our smallest dog is a 16 lb Chiweenie. He seems to shut down with the Gentle Leader and is more likely to cease walking altogether when wearing it, than he would be otherwise.At this point, we feel like the Gentle Leader helped us with our dogs' walks but also may have provoked some unwanted aggression and protest. We are currently looking for an alternative, and are considering Illusion collars (or something similar) as we are not comfortable with pinch/choke chains."
555,Jenga - 2006 Edition,0/0,5.0,"My husband and I play Jenga often. You catch yourself holding your breath while trying to remove blocks without toppling them over. You will find Jenga challenging, and entertaining. The stack may wobble while you're trying to gently push a block through to the other side. You sigh a sense of relief when you pull the block through and they are all still standing. You try to set your opponent up so his next move will be an impossible one. Don't forget to use only one hand even when it starts to lean..."
556,Tuffy's Ultimate Bowmerang Dog Toy,0/0,1.0,"I got this for my 25 pound poodle mix. He tore through it in less than a day (about an hour of play) and was pulling the stuffing out, and the squeakers. It's a shame because it's a fun toy for both canine and human. My dog truly loved it more than just about any toy he's ever had, and is beside himself since we took it away rather than let him leave a trail of stuffing through house. I know it says on the package ""There is no such thing as indestructible"" but it really should last more than a day."
557,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/2,2.0,"This iron was great until it died today. I purchased this just 2 years ago and used it maybe once a week. I have other curling irons I've had 10 years that still work - and they were cheaper! I'm am extremely disappointed, given the high ratings and the apppearance of high quality of this product. I am bummed!"
558,Happi Tummi Natural Colic Relief Waistband,1/1,5.0,We love this product. I purchased it for my niece. She was having 2-3 hour long cholic fits at night but not anymore. Her crying sessions due to upset stomach are maybe 45 minutes long. I love the way it smells too. I took the recommendation and only warm 15 seconds and that's definately long enough. My sister in law has been using it every night for two weeks and swears by it.
559,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,2.0,"We ordered this crate after reading several great reviews and looking at it in Petco. It seemed like a good quality crate, however, when it arrived, there was rust spots on the crate, the locks won't work because the lock bar and the hole don't line up and the crate was already bent and didn't align well. It was pretty disappointing and I would not recommend that anyone by this crate or products from this company. It was wobbly and not very sturdy. Not something that I would feel safe leaving my puppies in."
560,Multipet International Original Loofa Dog Mini 6-Inch Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"only one, I got the blue one, got it for free on amazon add onsSo cute! My chihuahua puppy loves it she is teething and it keeps her entertained! I would buy this again especially since it is less money than petsmart!"
561,Kiss My Face Soap Oz Bar Soap,3/3,5.0,"I switched to this soap after finding out the ""cruely-free"" ones I had been using contained palm oil ""hidden"" in the ingredient lists under different names. Palm oil production is driving orangutans to near extinction. Not exactly ""cruelty-free"" as those soaps claimed. This brand is great for sensitive skin."
562,Promensil Promensil,2/2,5.0,"Well, I read the other reviews, and I stuck it out for almost 60 days, one pill a day, and finally the hot flashes simply stopped. No side effects at all, just a pill each night. The hot flashes were pretty bad and were really disrupting my life. Now they're just gone! Great product!"
563,Safari LTD AMNH Feathered Dinos Toob,0/0,5.0,"My son loves Dinosaurs. Some of the ones we get are great and some, not so much. This product is great. He likes the small figures and they are made well."
564,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,3.0,"Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it. Its a tad thick for my taste but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application."
565,HTP Plantar Fasciitis Heel Seats,1/1,5.0,"I received my order today, immediately inserted them in my tennis shoes, went to the gym, walked on the treadmill for about 45 min, and I HAD NO PAIN !!!! I just ordered another pair, thank you HTP."
566,Designer Whey Aria Women's Protein,0/0,5.0,This product was ordered with a group of products needed for Dr. Mike's Power Cookie on 17 Day Diet. The cookies are a nice treat. Product shipped quickly.
567,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats",1/1,5.0,"We have been using these dog treats for a long time. The dogs love them a lot! You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats. You end up with liver ""dust"" when the larger pieces are used. I generally take this ""dust"" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor. Therefore, no product gets wasted."
568,Tone's Lemon Pepper Blend - 28oz shaker,0/0,1.0,This lemon pepper was advertise as NO SALT. So I ordered NO SALT LEMON PEPPER and received lemon pepper with salt. I was very disappointed but didn't bother to return it.
569,"Stila Illuminating Powder Foundation Refill, 0.34 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"It is by far the best powder foundation I have ever used. You can easily find a color that match your skin, and even with oily skin, it actually works really nice. Very happy with my Stila powder."
570,Farouk LOW EMF GF 1541 Professional 1300 Watt Hair Dryer with Diffuser,0/0,2.0,I do not recommend this particular model. I love the brands but this model must be defective. The first one I received never worked. I received a replacement and it worked for about 4 months and now blows only cold air. Try a different one!
571,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,5.0,"Awesome product! I feel like my gums are healthier and my breath has improved as well! It works just as well or better than using floss. It comes with a lot of different ends like a tongue scraper and other specialty fittings, which are helpful. I also was pleased with the price I got it for on Amazon.com. Excellent product!"
572,"Kendall Telfa Non-Adherent Dressing, 3"" x 4"", 100/BX",0/1,2.0,I've seen this brand in hospitals so I thought it would be good for wound care. I needed the non-stick but the pad itself was very thin. I wouldn't order it again. I'd stay with a thicker pad. I was disappointed.
573,Grand Amour Perfume by Annick Goutal for women Personal Fragrances,4/4,5.0,"Grand Amour by Annick Goutal is only sold at the more upscale stores in NYC like Bergdorf Goodmans, and Saks Fifth Avenue. You cannot purchase it at Bloomingdale's they aren't considered upscale enough anymore,(BS),so I'm real happy that it's available on Amazon for half the price of retail which is just unheard of these days. My Girlfriend has extravagant taste but she is not tacky. Many perfumes today have a disgusting sweetness that actually makes me physically ill when I come in contact with them. White Diamonds is a good example crappy cheap sickening ladies perfume that makes me squeamish. Grand Amour has a beautifully natural long lasting floral kind of scent that is unlike anything I've ever experienced. The girlfriend also like Channel, Antonia's Flowers and some other brands that I can't remember off thee top of my head. Hope this Info helps female Amazon shoppers."
574,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,5.0,my little baby need alot of diapersthis diaper is good for little babypampers is best diaper ever !!!
575,My Brest Friend Pillow,0/0,5.0,Love how it clips around your waist so it stays put no matter how much you or the little one squirms. Has raised bumps on flat surface of pillow to raise baby's head in line with her spine while she eats.
576,Eclectic Institute Inc Black Raspberry,1/1,5.0,This is exactly what I was looking for and the price was good. I previously ordered from another supplier and failed to notice that their product was not freeze-dried. I will never make that mistake again! This brand is awesome. You can even break open the capsules and dump out the inside under your tongue and actually taste the black rasberries. This does not work with the cheaper non-freeze dried sources.
577,Classic Nutri-Berries for Parakeets 12.5 oz Tub,0/0,5.0,"Nutriberries are a great food! Leave them in the ball shape, or grind into smaller pieces, they are good for all birds. As Nutriberries come in many shapes and flavors, I recommend Nutriberries to all bird owners."
578,Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat,0/0,5.0,Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat
579,"8"" LumiStick Brand Glowsticks Glow Stick Bracelets Mixed Colors (Tube of 100)",1/1,3.0,I first purchased these glow sticks to hand out at our trunk or treat event. The kids preferred (and chose) the glow sticks over our candy options. We purchased the glow sticks again for a summer night glow stick pool party. One hundred glow sticks at the bottom of our pool (we did not use the bracelet connectors) looked awesome. The only problem was that we could not convince the children to leave the sticks at the bottom of the pool. I would recommend (and have already done so) these sticks as a purchase and plan to purchase more around Halloween again this year.
580,Ortho Bed Wedge,0/0,5.0,Excellent product design and quality. Like this wedge shape better than any other for elevating my feet to reduce swelling.
581,Wahl Professional 8355 Designer Professional Vibrator Clipper,0/1,4.0,"The clippers cut very evenly, and I have absolutely no complaints so far. I've owned them for about a month and already have recouped my $$. It is a bit heavy, but I assume a quality product should have a bit of weight to it."
582,Styli-Steals Flat Eye Pencils,0/0,5.0,"notes on pencilsbest eyeliner pencils i have ever come across and thats why i was prepared to purchase them even though they're quite expensive.but this time they arrived with the 'pencil' part melted into the lid like they'd been left in the heat somewhere during transport.they all needed sharpening back about 1 cm before they could be used.and while im at it, i might mention that $30 to post 4 pencils that may not even weigh 1 oz to oz is outrageous!will look locally better before i would even consider buying them this way again."
583,McDavid Universal Back Support,0/0,5.0,"Bought one for my dad as his birthday gift. His back injured at college basketball games some 30 years ago. He really like it since it is a low profile fit, yet very effective comparing to his old leather back guards."
584,Shiseido Shiseido Sun Protection Eye Cream Spf 32,0/0,5.0,"This is my daytime eye cream. I used to use a non-SPF eye cream, but after realizing how damaging the sun can be to the eye area (it's very delicate and sensitive), I invested in this wonderful stuff. I use it along side the SPF 60 Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion N after my morning routine. It's moisturizing, glides on easily, and doesn't irritate my eyes. It's got Zinc Oxide (9.3%), an excellent physical sunscreen that I really like to look for in my suncare products.It also lasts quite a while- while, yes, it is pricey, it's well worth the money you spend.I use about the size of half a pea for both of my eyes every day, and the tube has lasted me over three months.Highly recommended."
585,Midwest Quiet Time Fashion Pet Bed,0/0,1.0,"I loved the pink color and fuzziness of this item. However, the description states they are machine washable. I got these, washed them and they fell apart at the seams after only the first wash and no use. I only gave them 1 star because they are cute. Overall, poor workmanship and I doubt they would withstand actual use from even my 2 lb. puppy."
586,"Chewable Pineapple Bromelain - Natural Digestive Enzyme, 100 tabs,(Good'n Natural)",0/1,5.0,"This product tastes yummy. It is good. It tastes great for both of us. It's cheap, nutritional and it satisfies my palate and this word count."
587,Now Foods Virgin Coconut Oil,3/4,5.0,"If you have hypoglycemia, this will give you hours of relief! I take two twice per day and no longer suffer much from the headaches and shakiness. I can go longer between snacks and rarely have that ""I have to eat or die"" feeling. These capsules really help!"
588,Tiger Balm Tiger Balm Muscle Rub For Muscle Pains,0/0,5.0,"I use this muscle rub on most of my clients. You don't need very much either, very concentrated. Really works well for achy-sore muscles."
589,Kiss My Face Soap Oz Bar Soap,1/1,1.0,"YUCK!!!Too bad there's no option for zero star reviews, 'cause this soap deserves one.After three uses, I have broken out in one of the nastiest cases of contact dermatitis that I've had in years. If you're even slightly sensitive, I've avoid this one like the Plague.Two Weeks Later"
590,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,"Granted I had not replaced my curling iron in many years, when I finally did, I went with this one. I find this to be a great buy. The various heat settings really help each person determine how much is required to accomplish their curls, without overdoing the heat and causing damage. The barrel size is nice and the swivel chord is heavy sent as it does not get tangled during use. Love this!"
591,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,2/2,5.0,"Safari Professional Large Nail Trimmer For DogsI have been using these clippers for a couple months now on three small dogs. After reading the reviews from others I can also say that yes after TONS of other horrible nail clippers - THE SAFARI ONES ARE GREAT.They are easy to use. My dogs still don't like me to touch their feet, but since these clippers do exactly what they say they will do - it makes it a lot easier and saves me $10/dog for nail clipping."
592,Mustela Foam Shampoo for Newborns - 5.07 oz.,1/1,5.0,"I decided to buy all Mustela products for my newborn as my friends have raved and I know it's the beloved brand in France. After the recent dust up with Johnson and Johnson products, I decided only to use Mustela or Burt's Bee and glad I did. I've used this shampoo from day one and my baby girl did not develop a severe case of cradle cap. When it would slightly appear between baths, I used the shampoo and it would disappear after each wash. Highly recommended... my baby is 3 months now and she has bathed every night since she turned a month old and I'm still using the same bottle, so it last along time."
593,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Homemade Wonderful Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",1/1,4.0,"This bread has a wonderful taste and texture. It is great for sandwiches and toast or making croutons or bread crumbs. The only negative is the large amount of butter and eggs required to make a loaf. If you don't want to waste those egg yolks, use them for some pudding and make that while the bread is baking."
594,Bliss Lemon + Sage Body Butter 1.7 oz,0/0,5.0,"My 10 year old son has a skin disorder called Keratosis Pilaris, which is a skin condition that causes rough patches and small, acne-like bumps, usually on the arms, thighs and buttocks. It had gotten so bad that he had these bumps, that looked like heat rash, on his legs and arms. I have been putting this on his skin for 3 days and the bumps are fading and becoming smaller and fewer between! I can't express how happy this makes me."
595,"Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)",0/0,4.0,i ordered this to use on my hands and feet cause they are really dark it softens them but i have not seen results on my feet a a little on my hands.
596,API Bio-Chem Zorb Pouch Size 6,0/0,5.0,Great filters. They work so well for my fish tank. I have used them for a couple of years now. They do the job.
597,"Urinozinc Prostate Formula, 60 Count",0/1,1.0,I pee a lot. It's what I do. Been checked by the doc as recently as 3 months ago. Everything was good so maybe this didn't help me because my problem is not linked to my prostate. I'm sure it goes back to my troubled childhood... as all problems with the world do.I figured I'd give it a shot since it wasn't outrageously expensive and got some good reviews. Maybe it'll work for you. Maybe not.
598,"Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,My dogs love this product. It is a fine heathy treat which I give them as a reward. It's also easy to break so that little dogs can enjoy them as well.
599,"Arrowhead Mills Puffed Corn Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I've long hated popcorn because it got stuck in my teeth and sometime you hit a hard kernel and thought your filling was going to pop right off!I've purchased this cereal thinking it would be a great morning meal, and it is, but I use it much more as a snack. You could add seasonings to it to spice up, but I like it plain and I even bring it to the movies. Good healthy snack a better choice than popcorn, at least for me."
600,Cricket RPM 12 XL Row Round Brush,0/0,5.0,I love this brush! I wish they made it a little larger. It works just great! The hair doesn't slip off the brush before you get the hair dryer to your hair. I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I was a cosmetologist and this is a great brush!! I highly recommend it! I love all the sizes but like I said I wish they made this brush a little larger.
601,"Alex 36"" X 36"" Vinyl Padded Playmat",0/0,5.0,"My son loves this. He is 3 and 1/2 and he loves cars, and he was really excited when I have him this playmat. It is also REALLY awesome that it folds up into a storage box for all of his cars. It's very easy to fold up and unfold, and it is easy to clean also if something gets spilled on it."
602,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,2/2,5.0,"Our Chihuahua is 5lb 6 oz and gets very chilly the moment the sun sets. This jacket is perfect for his evening walks. I got the Extra Small and it fits perfectly. The velcro fastens securely under his belly and across his chest, he doesn't pee on the coat when he lifts his leg and he looks awesome in it. It's very subtle and cozy."
603,Free-Up Unsented Massage Cream -16 oz.,0/0,5.0,"This FREE UP massage cream is very good and the ridge that was left fromthe incision has almost gone after 2 months following my hip replacement surgery and the scar is getting very light. My physical therapist recommended this product and this is what they use at Reliant Rehab in The Woodlands, Tx. I highly recommend this product."
604,Nintendo Wario Plush 12 Inch,0/0,5.0,My son loves his Wario plush figure. He is very rough with his plushes and Wario is still in good shape.
605,Edible Gold Flake Shaker,3/3,3.0,First
606,"Technique 350 Round Brush 1.5""",1/1,4.0,"I've used this brand of brushes for years, having bought them from my hair stylist, and especially like the pull-out hair separator on the end of the brush. It makes using a comb while drying your hair unnecessary. The brushes wear well, unless they get crushed in your luggage and the end cap won't stay in place anymore. A lesson learned"
607,"Sportsheets Hide Your Vibe Pillow, Black",0/0,4.0,"I purchased this pillow our of curiosity. My husband and I are always looking for better ways to hide our sex toys from prying eyes and this seemed to fit the bill. You can comfortably fit three toys in here without noticing much but past that and it gets bulgy. Only one side of the pillow is well padded so make sure that side is ""up"" before placing anywhere someone might see. We use it to hide on our bed so it is not that big of a deal as we just remove them at night.Expect this product to be SMALL. It looks roughly 10x10 or 12x12 which is much smaller than I had imagined. The zipper is a little on the cheap side but is VERY well hidden. It looks like a pillow case cover. The zipper seems like it will be likely to break after repeated use but for the price it is worth it."
608,AquaCraft Paradise Sailboat,0/2,1.0,"When I first saw this rc model I was going to get it.The first of last month I put it on my wish list.At that time it was for sale from e hobby 169.00 and free shipping.Now it is over 200.00 and over 14.00 shipping. Whats realy going on that puts this model in the price range of 1 meter boats and smaller.Well kile I said at the top UP,UP,AND AWAY."
609,Xacto X75320 Small Mitre Box Set,0/0,5.0,"The red handle of saw unscrews sometimes but just screw it back on.You only get 45 and 90 degree cuts. If you need different angles, you gotta choose a different one like I did."
610,Sof'Feet 12 pak Replacement Abrasive Screens 12,0/0,5.0,This is an amazing product. I have used them for four years now and have also purchased several for gifts. I won't go back to using any other product.
611,Geo F. Trumper's Limes Shaving Refill,0/0,3.0,"I had high hopes for this soap, as it's highly thought of in reviews as well as traditional-shaving websites. The smell of the soap technically is ""limes"" but is more accurate to the rind of a key lime, which might not be expected. I also found over time it basically smelled like Dove soap to me. Not that it's a bad thing, just not the refreshing ""lime"" smell I was hoping for.The soap was okay, ok slip, ok lather... but didn't ring my bell. Paid it forward to a friend who liked it a bit more than I did, but also wasn't blown away.Maybe I just got a bad bar? For the price and the brand recognition, I'm guessing they have pretty fair quality control and bad bars are rare.Probably won't be trying a Trumper's soap again, and if I do, probably won't be Limes."
612,Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,SO glad that I found something that is healthy and yummy for my puppy. She gobbles them up whenever I give them to her.
613,Jenga - 2006 Edition,1/1,5.0,"I love Jenga and have played it for years. I bought this for my husband with the assumption that instead of having to build the tower after each game, one could toss the bricks into the nifty carrying case. However, when we went to toss all of the bricks into the bucket thingy they didn't fit. I would have bought the Jenga game in the regular packaging if I had known that, but ultimately, Jenga is a great game so it doesn't matter."
614,Wahl 5537-500 Performer Battery Operated Beard and Mustache Trimmer,0/0,4.0,"OK look, I don't use this to trim my facial hair. Actually I don't plan on using this unit anywhere near my face. I use this to trim the hair down in my danger zone. I haven't found a product that effectively removes the hair in this area so I have been using a variety of beard trimmers over the years. These products won't get the area perfectly smooth but you just have to follow up with a safety razor and you will be good.I decided to buy this product based on price, design, and the Wahl brand.Here are the pros and cons of this product:Pros:1. Powerful motor mows down the short hairs with ease2. The design looks good and it feels good in your hand3. Price4. Comes with some accessories should you decide to use this on your face5. Battery operated as opposed to plug and chargeCons:1. EXTREMELY NOISY - If you are in the shower with this thing, people will know what you are doing in there. It is much noisier than the last few models I have used.2. Looks kinda cheap to me but then again most of them at this price point do.3. Very easy to clip some sensitive skin down in that area if you are not careful as the blade moves very fast. I nicked myself twice and drew blood. ...Not painful but annoying.4. I don't think it's waterproof so be careful if you plan on rinsing it. I just do a quick rinse to the tip and clean it with alcohol.For what I use it for, I think it's good for the price and does the job very well. I'm sure if it can cut the hair down there, it must be good for the hair on your face.As long as you can handle the noise, I recommend this unit."
615,Badger Sleep Balm,2/2,5.0,"I'm a BIG fan of Badger Balm products.A little goes a long way, they are organic, and the tin lasts forever,This one is great for relaxation, yes. Smells lovely. But like the Healing Balm, It has multiple uses.Use For:RelaxationMeditationRelief of headaches/MigraineDry itchy skin anywhereDry cracked hands/feetCuticle BalmLip BalmAs a Moisturizer after shaving (legs)Roseacea ( I put it on my rosey face patches before bed, instead of using a night cream, ladies)WindburnCuts/ScrapesBug BitesDiaper RashMassage for you & Baby too"
616,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,1/1,5.0,"I first got this for my daughter when she was 9 months old. She was not able to walk with it then, she would hang on to the handle and then fall forward as the walker would move too fast out in front of her since she wasn't moving her feet. She wasn't ready yet, but absolutely loved playing with the detachable toy panel part and still does. Her favorite part is the little door that opens and says peekaboo! Now that she is 10 months we tried again walking and she is getting the hang out with but is still pretty wobbly and can't steer but she has so much fun that she gets mad when it's time to stop. We have to help guide her and control how fast it goes and now she wants to walk all the time! Check out her face in my picture, it is priceless. Good toy, but you just have to use you own judgement on when your baby is ready for it."
617,Euphoria Cologne by Calvin Klein for men Colognes,0/1,4.0,"This CK cologne is very attractive, yet it is not without problems. It has an unusual fragrance for men of lavander, roses, and cinnamon - without it being not unquestionably manly. And this was an anchievement of sorts, as a flowery fragrance is typically associated with women. There exist two downsides, however. The first is that it does not hold very well, and the second plays off the first. It is slightly cloying. So I believe CK needs to refine this cologne - and Euphoria Intense is not the answer. Yet even still, this is an intriguing cologne, if not excellent, and meant for sporty/informal events, school wear, or a night's out, rather than for formal wear or the office."
618,Avalon Organic Conditioner,0/0,2.0,"The conditioner was the better of the two, but I didn't care for this product. The scent doesn't quite mix right to make a pleasant scent. It's ok, I just think there are better products out there. My hair is mid length, natural curly and thick. I didn't think there was any advantage to my hair type as far as moisture or frizz free benefits go."
619,Stila Lip Pencil,0/0,5.0,"I was happy to find the Stila #14 lipliner. It is my favorite color so, of course, they discontinued it!"
620,"Radio Flyer 2700Z Pathfinder Wagon, Red",0/0,5.0,"Great value for this radio flyer. Remember as a kid how great it was but this is even better. Seatbacks, cup holders and safety belts. Well worth the money, easy to put together, excellent directions."
621,Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
622,New Life Spectrum Thera A Formula Non-medicated Anti-Parasitic - 150 g,1/1,5.0,"I never write reviews but I am so happy with this product I had too. I was very skeptical even after reading the great reviews but decided to make one more 'last hope' food purchase for my sickly Blue Ram. While all the other fish in the tank were thriving, he was very thin and progressively had gotten worse over the last few months, showing no interest in any food I bought. I tried to find the old 'Parasite Guard' food as a last effort to save my fish. I stumbled over this and thought I'd give it a shot. He showed little interest for a couple of days but then began to nibble it. I have only been using this for a few weeks and my fish looks and feels 100% better. He devours this food! His colors are coming out and he doesn't have that thin appearance now. He is gaining weight and becoming feisty. The other fish love this food as well, even the algae eater looks for every crumb hours after feeding time. Will definitely order again, but will be a while as you don't have to use much. It goes a long way. Thank you for this product,"
623,Gourmet Pet Feeder,1/1,5.0,"I love this thing.. Have a small dog (&lt;30 lbs), and it holds enough food to last almost 3 weeks! (now I just need the water side to hold 3 weeks worth!)"
624,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,3.0,"Tea is a good value for the price. Was hard to find any where else. I like this brand of tea, also."
625,Medline Transport Wheelchair with Brakes,1/1,4.0,"My 85 year-old mom loved the chair! She has a motorized scooter to get around her retirement community but traveling off ""campus"" was challenging. This lightweight chair easily folds up and takes up little space in her small condo."
626,Skintimate Dry Skin Moisturizing Shave Cream-10 oz,0/0,5.0,"I love this stuff. I have very dry skin, and i don't feel like the gels really protect my skin while getting a close shave. With this, I get a close shave and moisturized skin. Great product and very hard to find in stores."
627,Moby Clutching Toy,0/0,4.0,"I think this toy is adorable, and my son loves it too! He is nearly a year old, and has been playing with it for months. However, and I know this goes without saying, but make sure your baby is supervised when playing with this toy! My son was playing with it, and I was right there with him, and he put it in his mouth. Somehow he got the face of the fish wedged in his mouth, with his upper teeth in the line of the fish mouth, and his lower teeth behind the top of the fish head! It took a minute to get him unstuck, and he was pretty freaked out by it, but no harm done. He still loves the toy, and I still let him play with it."
628,"CarbRite Bar, 12 bars",0/0,5.0,"Perhaps the best protein bar on the market. With less than 160 calories, few net carbs, and over 12gms of protein this is a hit. It is simply a bonus that it tastes good and is not hard on your teeth like other comparable bars."
629,Frantoia Barbera Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Sicily- 2 Bottles each containing 33.8 ounces,0/2,2.0,"I don't mind subtle, but I thought outside of peppery on the back of the throat, it seems quite tasteless. I imagine some like it this way, but i would like more green and olivevy."
630,K&H Cool Bed III Cooling Dog Bed,0/0,3.0,"I thought the dog would love this (It's the 70s style water bed, but for the pup (just wait a couple of years and dogs be saying their back hurts)), but the dog does't like the fact that it's swishes around (moves) when she steps on it! Won't go on it at all, and it's too little for me :(PROS"
631,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,"GREAT soap -- concentrated, a small amount makes massive suds, the peppermint leaves your skin tingly-fresh, and you can wash your hair with it. I love the stuff and stockpile it."
632,Multipet Plush Hanging Tree House for Birds 6-Inch,1/1,5.0,"I bought one of these years ago for my sugar glider and he loves it! It's the perfect size for him, maybe even a little roomy. It's the only house I've gotten for him that he can't destroy instantly. He does tear up the inside a little to ""nest"", but that's to be expected. It's machine washable, which is a huge plus. I recently bought another one for him on Amazon so that I can alternate them while one is being cleaned and hanging out to dry. It's made well and lasts long. Definitely worth it!"
633,"Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce",1/1,3.0,"It's very good. But even if you're a fan of Sandalwood, like me, I think you will prefer the 'Eton College' Taylor brand."
634,Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet Fountain,1/1,1.0,"Unlike other reviewers, my cats loved this fountain. I have three, and the fountain did a good job. I only put filtered water into the unit, and I cleaned it weekly.However, this week, my catsitter noticed that the motor had stopped. She unplugged the unit. I came home and thought it might just need cleaning. I discovered that the motor housing had melted. The spinning plastic bit of the motor had fused to the unit.Thank goodness my cat sitter unplugged it. I can't imagine what might have happened if she hadn't.Of course, anyone that has used a fountain knows that once your pets get used to it, they won't drink water any other way. Luckily Petsmart had a stainless steel 360 available. It is a similar motor but smaller. I've used the plastic ones previously. Anyways, I won't go back to the big dog unit after seeing what happened with the motor housing."
635,"Lamaze Play & Grow Take Along Toy, Firefly",0/0,5.0,"Our 5 month old loves this firefly. It's easier for her to hold this one than the Peacock, which we also have and love. She can get her arms around this one and we use this every time she gets in the car seat for a car ride. She ceases to get tired of this. Loves the crackly wings and rings."
636,NARS NARS Eyeliner Pencil - Kitty,0/0,5.0,Love this color for a bottom inner lid liner. Makes green eyes pop. I'm an esthetician and works well w any eye color makes whites appear more white Does not last All day. But Wonderful for portrait pics Dressing up going out Easy to reapply Use lots of black liner with it below lash line
637,Stomp Rocket Jr. Glow Kit,0/0,4.0,"Used this a a birthday party. Everyone enjoyed this toy. Glow in the dark did not really glow that much, but it was good to have extras."
638,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Silver Bullions,0/1,5.0,"I ordered this essie nail colour FED UP its beautiful color I really liked it , I was wearing it at a party my friend gave at his house and he even noticed it and said he really likes the color ,and there were guests there the women gave me a lot of compliments too and asked what colour it was and what brand so I told them everything and where they can buy for lower prices,again thank you amazon for great beauty products you carry for lower prices."
639,Now Foods Lemon Oil,1/1,5.0,"It smells like lemongrass, but it's just pure lemon oil. It's nice in a reed diffuser. I also use it on my heavy paper face mask, for changing the litter boxes. It really does block the odors."
640,Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker,1/1,4.0,"works just as advertised. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the volume can't be adjusted, but I can easily do this on my iPod or CD player. I have horrible insomnia and use it to play theta-delta soundwave tapes that help to keep me asleep with better dreaming (purchased from Australia). It works well under my pillow, but would probably not work under the heavy, dense foam pillows. As one of the posters mentioned above, he/she sleeps directly on the pillow speaker but I would be afraid it would destroy it since it seems quite delicate with thin wires. Under my regular pillow I can hear it well, even with earplugs."
641,Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.,0/0,5.0,"Okay, besides the part of the description which says it 'offers' alcohol (it's alcohol free), this stuff is great. I don't care if it has alcohol or not; I just care how it makes my air look. It's not greasy like the other old-school hair products that contained petro jelly, which this doesn't seem to have. It seems similar to leave-in conditioner yet it's a bit thicker than that. Overall, however, it's thin and slides through your fingers compared to other products like pomades and the heavier American Crew products, sort of like a hand lotion. It doesn't work as well for me if my hair isn't a little wet. So I just wet my hands, run them through my hair, lather up my hands with this stuff, and run that through my hair, and then press down the hair on the sides of my head and toss and flip in around the parts near the top and front--and it looks great and continues to throughout the day. When I accidentally touch my hair at some point in the morning, I don't have to go wash my hands like I do with some products--and there is no deal where it looks crusty later in the day. This is simply the best stuff for hair there is, for me."
642,K-Ii Enterprises Pet-Agree Dog Training Aid Ultrasonic,1/1,3.0,"Two small barking dogs next door, both same breed same age. Works well on one, but not the other. I'm still trying to get the deaf one to shutup."
643,Body Drench Quick Tan Spray 6 Oz,0/0,5.0,I use this product because my skin hates the sun. This is the only product I have found that gives me a natural looking glow and doesn't leave me streaky or orange. I love it! I now buy 3 at a time!
644,Liquid Stevia Root Beer 2 fl. oz.,1/1,1.0,"Ok ,I was very excited when I thought I could enjoy the flavor of root beer without calories or worrying about the effects of aspartame...well I was pretty disappointed in this.It does have a slight root beer flavor, but I wouls highly recommend using a whole dropper (or more) to a glass instead of the 6-8 drops suggested.Also I would suggest to the manufacturer to not only enhance the flavor but to also add some natural color to make it APPEAR to LOOK like real root beer.I think this was a great idea but needs to be tweaked more.Also use seltzer water instead of plain water otherwise it will be like drinking flat weak root beer."
645,Motrin IB Ibuprofen Pain Relief Caplets Dipenser Packets 50X2 (PRODUCT ARRIVES IN MANUFACTURERS DISPENSER BOX),0/0,5.0,"Long expiration date on these packets and the price make this a no brainer to conveniently carry in pocket, purse or first aid kit. These are reasonably priced as other refills for kits are just outrageous."
646,The First Years Spinning Drying Rack,0/0,5.0,"Good product - I can comfortably put 6 4oz Phillips Avent bottles, 2 Dr. Brown's 4oz bottles, and accompanying caps, nipples, and other parts, along with my Medela pump accessories on the rack. It is light-weight and convenient to store. The spinning feature is very desirable and handy."
647,TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo - 12 oz - Liquid,0/0,5.0,"This shampoo has worked wonders on my son's scalp psoriasis. He likes the smell (I think it's a little strong, almost like Pine Sol) and the way it makes his hair feel. I like that it's more natural than the strong medicated shampoos and the ingredients aren't irritating to his sensitive face. Been using it for about a month and no flakes or irritation. We ordered through Neem King and received it in only a couple days. I highly recommend this product and seller."
648,Dr. Fred Palmer Skin Whitener Cream 2 oz.,1/1,1.0,I don't see no difference . What a waste of money ! I really have some scares I want to fade can anyone recommend something better?
649,DaVinci SleighToddler Bed,0/0,5.0,"This is a nice looking and sturdy bed. Just the right height, out crib mattress fits perfectly. She loves it. It's her ""big girl bed"". The ability to be able to get in and out of bed as you wish astounds the little snapper heads."
650,Twister,0/0,5.0,"Is it normal to twist yourself in such a way that you feel like a human pretzel? And when this happens, am I winning or losing? I never could tell! This classic game that reminds me of late 60's music such as the Beach Boys, the Mamas & Papas, and Paul Revere & the Raiders is really a total blast to play with other people. I tried playing Twister alone one time and I felt like I was defeating the purpose because nobody was standing to the side to watch me hurt myself and stumble around with neverending silent facial giggles. I always feel like somebody's watching me! Truly not one of the more appropriate and proud moments of my life right there, haha. I'm referring to the embarrassment of playing alone to my old Black Sabbath albums. I'm not proud of that at all. I could care less how ridiculous my twisty, turny, awkward body movements are to the always-ready-to-humilate eyeballs watching over me!Anyway, Twister is a game for the entire family. It's sort of like an exercise routine when you really get into it. Maybe even yoga? Nah, not yoga. Entertaining in one square-shaped area on the floor that's safe and well... no, it's not really safe at all. I mean it is safe unless, like I say above, you really get into it. In that case be careful not to fall all over the place and bang your knees on the hard living room floorboards which can bruise with age and cause walking discomfort. When you walk funny you don't want people to know you were twisting the night away the night before. I do wonder if people have actual memories of playing Twister. Is it the kind of embarrassment you'd want to remember? Maybe for some folks. Maybe for me too, who knows?"
651,JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,0/0,5.0,We've bought several JJ Cole branded items and have always been happy with the quality. This is easy to clean (wipe off) and very compact.
652,"Mentholatum Natural Ice Lip Protectant SPF 15, Cherry Flavor, 0.16-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Back in 1969 I discovered a lipbalm that is still my favorite today !Mentolatum Natural Ice (formerly Mentolatum Stick) is the perfect antidote to dry or chapped lips. It contains just enough soothing Mentholatum to really cool my lips but is gentle enough for daily use. The texture is smooth and it glides on easily. Natural Ice really lasts on my lips so I don't have to constantly reapply it.I buy it in bulk, and each time I gift a friend with one, they become instantfans ! Try Natural Ice, and you'll never go back to any other lipbalm !"
653,"Natures Miracle Quick Results Training Pads, 80 Count",1/1,5.0,"I bought these not for puppy training, but to help with a kitty problem. My poor kitty recently had a kidney infection and had begun to urinate outside of his litterbox. The vet told us this might happen again while he was on the medicine regimine until it started to work inside his body. Luckily for us his box is on concrete, I bought these pads and placed them in the spot he was using outside of the box to help aborb as much as possible of the urine and they worked great! Used in combination with the Nature's Miracle Urine cleaner there is no smell in these spots! Now I use them as liners under the litterboxes they help to catch the litter trails and any little ""extras"" that might be stuck on kitty feet. Remember my kitty was sick, if your kitty has a ""pee"" problem please take them to the vet! They are probaly sick, these pads did not solve our kitty problem, the vet did, but these pads were a great asset to get us through a tough time and beyond."
654,Gymnic Rody Horse,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my 18 month old as he kept trying to ride the puppy and he instantly fell in love. At first he had a little trouble getting on and needed help figuring out how to swinf his leg over and not face backwards but now at almost 2 he drags his ""pony"" around and bounces everywhere. Very durable daddy has even sat on it, comes with a patch kit although even with the puppy chewing on the ears still hasn't been punctured. Comes in lots of color choices well worth the money."
655,Tourmaline Tools Lite 1043 by Hot Tools Professional 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Professional Hair Dryer,1/1,4.0,"Both my husband and I loved this dryer, it dried hair quickly (we both have long hair) and was very comfortable to hold. Unfortunately it just stopped working before it was a year old. Have had many other less expensive dryers that lasted years and were only retired because newer and better ones came along. Wish this one lasted - disappointed that it did not. Not sure if I should take chance on buying another one."
656,Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,0/0,5.0,"Our kids love these toys and they're painted very well and extremely colorful. The only issue, as any parent knows with these squirter toys, is that the holes are in really strange places, making it extremely difficult to get the water out."
657,"Sebamed moisturizing lotion, for sensitive skin, 6.8-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Amongst all of Sebamed products, this one is my favorite! It's not oily like other body lotions out there; meanwhile the moisture is locked in fairly well (~20hrs). I also love the smell of this product"
658,Everlasting Treat Ball,2/2,5.0,"I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats. My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure. But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right ""not-too-fast, not-too-slow"" rate. Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours. The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it. This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable. My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear. I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats. I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work. A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treatswww.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1"
659,"Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink",1/1,2.0,"Yes, these rollers will curl your hair. But the clips leave significant crimp marks, and there doesn't seem to be any way around it. The lovely curls are definitely marred by the marks. Too bad!"
660,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Folding Princess Castle,1/1,2.0,"When this castle arrived it was everything the good reviews said it was; beautiful, folded up nicely, and kept my 4 year old daughter busy for a long while. However, after a week of light play, for a child who takes care of her toys, the wood started chipping and peeling off. I mean, she could have gotten a terrible splinter. So very disappointing!!! I would not recommend it now. It is too bad because it really does have nice features and it is very pretty."
661,20' Large Dog Tie Out Cable Leash,0/0,5.0,"This tie out cable was a much better price through Amazon than the pet stores or even Walmart. That is why I purchased though Amazon. The brand is the same as if you bought it at the pet store or Amazon, so why would you pay more and have to drive to get this when Amazon offers a lot more without mileage and hassle.. :)I have large Boxer dogs and NO FENCE, right beside busy highway so I have to have a tie out cable that is strong/sturdy enough to support their weight and ""Pull power"" so they can remain safe when they are outside.Thank you Amazon for helping ease the pain with the economy and high prices by offering great products at a reasonable price.."
662,Soda Siphon + 10 CO2 Chargers Included - easy to use - 1 Liter - 2 Year No-Hassle Warranty - Black,0/0,5.0,I really like my beverages fizzy and this siphon does an excellent job with this. It is very easy to use and clean as well. I am very happy with this purchase.
663,"Just for Men Brush-In Color Gel for Mustache, Beard & Sideburns, Sandy Blond, 1 color gel, (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,"I have used Sandy Blond on my head hair for ~ 5 years. At first I used the hair coloring but it was messy and I wasted a whole bottle just trying to fix sideburns and hair at the temple. Also, if you only have graying in a few spots, the hair coloring will make the rest of your hair darker which really doesn't fix anything and makes it noticable. I found that the beard coloring works perfect on head hair also and it is much easier to target only the areas you need to fix. You can also get multiple applications out of a kit. Just make sure to squeeze all the air out of the tubes before putting the caps on or it can degrade.Now, 5 years later, that my gray extends over the ears also, I still use the beard coloring. Once you brush it on, it works best if you take the brush and pull some of the coloring out onto the head to blend it together. If you experiment with the time left in hair by starting at 5 minutes and working up in 1/2 minute increments, you will eventually find where the color is correct. That combined with the blending will make this product work very well. BTW- 5 minutes doesn't hardly change the hair but for me but 6 - 7 minutes works. You should use a stop watch to get consistent results."
664,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"this litter box is great , but my only complaint is that there were no assembly instructions included . I had to check out a few video reviews on youtube to see how to assemble"
665,Skip Ball (colors may vary),0/0,4.0,This toy can be alot of fun. The ball on the end is very light making it hard to get it going.
666,Tweezerman - Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze,0/0,5.0,"I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes. I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they're so fine. They slip between any tweezers I've ever used. But THESE tweezers were my lifesaver. They grip even the finest hair. You won't be sorry."
667,Buckaroo,0/0,1.0,The only time this thing ever bucked was when my kid forced it too. No matter what the level setting 1-3 (3 being the hardest) it was beaten EVERY TIME.Also there were times when it was very difficult to get the saddle to stay on. Save your money and avoid. I am not sure how Hasbro can sell such a piece of junk.
668,,0/0,4.0,"As an OT in the home care field I have seen many pieces of adaptive equipment. The Standers bed rail advantage is one of the best. Reasonably priced thru Amazon, Easy to assemble with no tools required and it is sturdy and stable during use. It provides people with leverage to get their legs in and out of bed,assist during rolling and supine to sit and for sit to stand. It also assists during transfers to the bed. I take the pocket off as it takes away from the handle surface. My patients are usually hesitant at first but are surprised and happy with the ease the bed rail provides them during bed mobility and transfers."
669,Spring Swings Fun Ride Original Zip Line,0/0,1.0,"I will update this review once we are able to try this toy, but I'm not impressed so far"
670,The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),1/1,5.0,"I've tried many different cat toys over the years.There is a distinct difference in the quality of play between this particular toy (with the carefully arranged feather ""bird""), and every other ""fishing pole"" design toy I've tried. The design of the ""bird"" causes it to spin (snap swivel attachment to the string) when moved through the air quickly. This creates a sound that is irresistible to cats. Combine this with the length of the pole, and you have what I believe is the most effective toy out there when it comes to getting those kitties moving.So if you've been underwhelmed by a ""stick and string"" type cat toy--this one is still very much worth a try."
671,Kaytee Supreme Diet for Guinea Pig,0/1,2.0,our guinea pig poops like crazy after she eats this stuff. she doesnt like it more than carrots or apples. we're going to give it to her once a week. it runs right through her. we wont b buying this again

673,Hammer Nutrition High Energy Electrolyte Drink,0/0,5.0,"You can really feel the provided complex carb in this drink, the steady energy. It does not provide the high sugar content like other sports drink. Highly recommend this drink."
674,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,1/1,5.0,I ordered this for my 6 cats because they love to lay on suitcases. I threw a blanket over it because they have claws and they were getting caught on it. Well now sometimes they sleep under it and they have a ball playing on top and under it. They have been playing on it for months and it is holding up extremely well. It's very sturdy and they love sleeping on it too!
675,Boericke & Tafel Boericke & Tafel Arniflora Arnica Muscle Pain And Stiffness Gel,1/1,5.0,"I tried this when my office assisstant came in with it one day. There's no smell, and no skin reaction to the gel. Best of all, it kills the pain immediatly! I have severe tendonitis in both hands and am unable to use the topicals that most can becuse of allergies. This stuff sinks in right away, and you don't have to wait for it to work, it just does! I bought it from Amazon because the same gel in my area is 3.00 a tube more. It is definitly worth the 3.00, but I'm greedy, IT'S MY 3.00!"
676,Cassia Clove 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g),0/0,5.0,"this is some great soap. i bought this out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. incredible fragrance, long lasting. if i were to make any criticism it would be the bars shape. i would much rather it be rectangular than square. this would not deter me from buying it again. a very good quality product. i will definitely buy it again."
677,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,This product is excellent. It's ideal for people who hate flossing. It is user friendly and much less time consuming. I'll recommend the Ultra Waterpik Flosser to persons with braces.
678,"NuGo All-Natural Nutrition Bar, Orange Smoothie, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)",0/0,5.0,"Ever since I was diagnosed with Fatty Liver( a very painful condition where the liver is so filled with fat that it stops functioning right and can not process sugars, fats, and carbs correctly. So when you eat it causes a horrid cramping pain under your right ribs) I stopped eatting...anything. Which is pretty bad too. Then I started trying different bars and found that many cause my Fatty liver to hurt bad until I ran onto these. Many of the bars are based in chocolate which is not my go to food even before I was diagnosed. So I am always looking for tasty bars OTHER then chocolate.The Orange Smoothie Nugo bar and the Vannilla Yogurt Nugo bars fit that bill well. The round rice things are softer and smaller then most bars which is better for me. They have a light sweet flavor that is very tasty and not alot of sugar substitutes/fat(which a low functioning liver can NOT process well). I think they are marketed to diabetics and I would totally reccomend them to anyone with that condition as well.I wish they sold them more locally and maybe at a better price but hey you can't have everything!!It is good with coffe in the morning(VERY hard for me to eat in the am but have to if I want to keep my blood sugar balance and metabilizum going all day) I add a piece of fruit or as a snack with water....or to replace a weak moment where you'd break out the candy bars...you just break out the orange smoothie bar!!So if you are looking for a tasty nutritonal bar that is fruity vs chocolaty then this IS the bar to buy!!I thank you for reading and I hope you have a happy healthy day:)"

They taste great and don't have that strange, gritty after taste that a lot of Power Bars have. They just taste like a granola bar with strawberries but they give you tons of energy."

683,"Wondfo Pregnancy Test Strips, 25-count",1/1,5.0,"Although I didn't see the double line I was hoping for, they work. Got my clear, correct, results. I love that these are affordable so you can test a few days even before missed period."
684,Mini Vise,0/0,4.0,"First, Amazon forces toy style reviews on this product. I had to agree that I'm over 13 and rate how fun, educational, etc. This is a tool and it is sturdy. There is little or no sloppiness. It fits the Dremel workstation. Very nice except it does not hold 1 1/2"" materials. It comes very close but won't. I had to return it."
685,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"I had been a fan of Pamers brand since my baby was a just a day older. I loved pamper's Cruiser but Baby Dry no longer keeps the baby dry. It gets saturated very quickly and sometimes leaks. With Pamper's Baby Dry diapers, you will have to change diapers very frequently (on an average every 3 to 4 hours) as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. It is cheaper for more diapers and I thought it was a good deal but you get what you paid for. I don't understand why so good quality name Pamper brand started producing so poor quality product. I am no longer ordering this product."
686,Sung By Alfred Sung For Women. Body Cream 6.8 Ounces,1/1,2.0,I used to buy this cream all the time many years ago and since I couldn't find it anymore I figured it had been discontinued so I was REALLY happy when I saw my favorite cream available again. The box was sealed with plastic wrap and it definetly appeared new. When I opened the box the name (Sung - Alfred Sung) is faded. I couldn't figure out why the letters would be faded off. The bottom of the jar has some minor scrapes too. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe its a really old product and maybe it was upside down and maybe the letters came off with the box itself while transporting it or keeping it in storage....nah!!! I decided to keep the cream anyway just to avoid any kind of conflict. It is definetly the Sung fragrance I just strongly believe its body lotion and not the thick-creamy original body cream.
687,True Colors,0/0,4.0,"This is a very fun game. The more people playing the better, 4 or more. This is a fun way to see what people think about you and makes you think of some interesting things about your friends. This game requires that one should know the people they are playing with an not someone barely known."
688,Diamond Shelled Walnuts with Omega 3 - Three Pounds of Walnuts,0/0,5.0,I bought these nuts for baking and they are very good quality. They have great flavor and no added stuff. If you look at the chopped nuts they ad some sort of preservative but these are just walnuts. Will buy again.
689,Realm Perfume by Erox for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"I love this stuff! I used to wear it all the time. I'm glad I found it. It smells so clean and refreshing. The product arrived early and was packaged well. I will use this company in the future. Great product, fast and cheap shipping,...I give it 5 stars."

When i tried them for taste, erxc after prying off a few I found the chocolare cofcering outstanding. The nalt ball centers were something else = more like glass marble. Aktogether I rate these as one big big dissapointment."
691,Waterpik Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,My old one finally gave out after 20 years of service! It was noisy but worked great. The new unit has a little more pressure and a lot more quitter. Great item for the price.
692,"Hagen Elite Underwater Mini Filter, UL Listed",1/1,5.0,I just completed a DIY co2 system from a youtube video i saw and it specifically mentioned this filter. WOW! This filter generates micro bubbles through the current it produces and I'm sure it will revive my dying plants! Its probably not good for a fish bowl or of that size because it does produce a current and your fish would probably not like it.

694,Potty Mouth,0/0,1.0,This is the second box of this that we have purchased plus the powder and neither work. Our Yorkies have been eating their poop since 6 wks old and we have tried everything to stop it and their almost 8 months old.Waste of money
695,Zodiac Flea and Tick Collar for 5-Month Dog,0/0,5.0,"I have been using the Zodiac brand 5 month flea and tick collars on my two dogs for a few years now.Neither of them has EVER had a FLEA or a TICK and they are outside all Summer enjoying the weather.Another great feature is that these continue to work, full strength, even after they get wet.The price is so reasonable too.I would recommend this product 110%."
696,"3M Littmann Master Classic II Stethoscope, Hunter Green Tube, 27 inch, 2632",2/2,4.0,"This stethoscope is worldwide famous, and here in Brasil is just the same. I can't say anything about shipping and delivery, as I ordered it online for a friend that were in the USA, and she brought it to me. No delays, no mistakes, I must say.Cons"
697,"Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted",0/0,1.0,"This product worked well for only a few weeks. After that, the power was very weak, so we changed the batteries. Again, it only worked a few weeks before the power weakened significantly. We tried adjusting the battery strip to more tightly grasp the battery, but it still failed. After replacing the batteries twice in less than 3 months, the product stopped working completely. Do not purchase this product. Search elsewhere!"
698,"Supersmile Professional Whitening System, Small or Large",0/0,4.0,"Its a great whitening product that improved the look of my teeth of course not like the hollywood style or even expert work.If all u want is just a better look without spending a fortune, go for supersmile."
699,100% Organic West African Shea Butter,1/1,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this product! I whipped it with my hand mixer, adding coconut oil and jojoba oil as well as a few drops of lavender essential oil. It is lovely, fluffy, and very moisturizing. Heals my skin well and I love using it for everything, even as a facial moisturizer. Highly recommend!"
700,Great Explorations Celestial Super Kits - Wonder Stars Super Kit,0/0,4.0,"Ok, so let me just get it out there and say I'm 20 years old and I wanted some glow in the dark stars in my room. I'm not embarrassed, either!There were a lot of stars of all different sizes(mostly small) that came in the package, and PLENTY of the paste/putty stuff. You just have to realize that you only need a pinch of it to last. I believe I bought this about 2 years ago, and the stars are still on my ceiling, with no re-pasting involved, so that's wonderful! I do wish the glow lasted all night (don't know why, how could I see them when I'm sleeping?), but it does last a good amount of the night. If my bedroom light is on for about 2 hours straight, and I turn off the lights the glowing will probably last around 40 minutes. I think that's enough time if you're trying to get your child to not be afraid of the dark or something. I think they're cool! Even if I am too old to have it on my ceiling..."
701,Gamewright Hisss Card Game,0/0,5.0,My 7 year old loves this game. I think we play this at least 10+ times a day. It's very fun and simple to play.
702,1/60 D/C VH-60N White Hawk Helicopter,0/1,5.0,"...and a welcomed addition to my ""fleet"" of 1/60th Blackhawk Helicopters (though the on-line product description said it was both ""1/60th"" and ""1/72nd"" scale). It's beautifully done - the graphics are first-class. The only one I'm missing is the USAF version (having already the Army, Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine[?]/VIP-Fleet variants). To my knowledge, there's no AF version available."
703,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Brownie Mix, 21-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",1/1,3.0,"Let me start by saying I am not gluten intolerant, but I I've been tentatively exploring gluten free products to see if it's the kind of change my family could make. I have had other Bob's Red Mill products, I particularly love the scones, and I've had some different things my sister made. I saw these brownies on sale so I decided to give them a try.I made them exactly as the package instructed and also added the chocolate chips and walnuts (we always have some kind of nuts in our brownies, I was glad when the package suggested it). The batter was really thick compared to a traditional brownie mix. I was hoping it would flatten out a bit during the cooking process, but it retained the weird appearance. I let them cool for a bit and when I cut into them I was surprised at how easy they were to cut, unlike normal brownies which kind of require a special technique so they don't get stuck all over and stuff, I was able to just slice the knife right through these.They actually smell really good, and visually they look nice and normal on the inside. I found the taste to be very bland however. When I bit into a chocolate chip, it was fine, but the plain batter is a bit too cakey and dry and not very flavorful. For me, they had a pretty distinct aftertaste, kind of buttery? I saw someone mention adding a bit of brown sugar.. maybe that would help, or perhaps instead of mixing chocolate chips throughout, I could layer flat chocolate pieces in the middle of the brownie mix. I've seen that done on traditional brownies and it was quite tasty.I don't know.. they weren't terrible by any means but as a non-gluten intolerant person who enjoys other Bob's Red Mill products I wasn't floored by them."
704,"Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, Black",1/1,5.0,"This product is simple,dependable and works great. I purchased it for my Mother. She liked it so well we purchased a second one for her to travel with. It is light weight and easy for seniors to operate."
705,Bedside Commode Toilet Seat Chair Frame - 9630,0/0,5.0,We have been using the chair as seat in a walk in a shower because of the handles on the side. It has worked very well.
706,"Babyliss Pro BABFRV2 Volare Ferrari Designed Professional Luxury Mid Sized Hair Dryer, Red, 2000 Watts",1/1,5.0,"A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!"
707,"Cardiovascular Research - Magnesium Taurate, 125 mg, 60 capsules",2/2,5.0,"After suffering with heart palpitations every day for almost a month (brought on by stress and anxiety), I began to research online and came across this product after reading about the benefits of magnesium. I have only been using this product for a few days but was so happy with seeing results so fast that I had to write a review.Let me first say I was having heart palpitations every 2-5 minutes, all day, every day ! After only 24 hours, my heart palpitations were cut in half ! After 48 hours, I am having a few here and there. Hopefully soon they will be completely gone. It also has done wonders for my anxiety in the short time I have been taking it. I feel much calmer and able to handle my nerves better. I take one 125mg in the morning and one in the evening."
708,Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder,0/0,4.0,"I tried this product based on a friends and fellow weight lifter/ex-marines suggestion. I could not be happier with this product.

709,Nix Premium Metal Two-Sided Lice Comb-1 ct.,0/0,5.0,"Its a great product, just make sure while using it you put a white colored bed sheet all over your child. It catches all lice and a few nits. If you use it everyday, atleast for a week, your child's head will be clean, provided your also take out the nits with your hands."

711,Cat Mate C10 Automatic Pet Feeder,0/0,4.0,"I was tired of kitty cries at 5:00 am. He would sit at the end of my bed a cry as loudly as he could until I got up, even if it was 2 hours! This has stoppped the crying. I set it for 5 am and actually got to sleep in. The only thing I wish it had was a ice pack for canned food. But for the price, its well worth a -finally- good nights rest."
712,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,4.0,"A friend convinced me to watch the show and I became hooked. Like a lot of others, the 10th doctor is my favorite and I really wanted a sonic screwdriver of my own, so when I saw this one I just couldn't pass it up.The toy is plastic, but despite that is an almost exact replica of the one used in the show. It is sturdy for the most part. The sound and light is great.I only have two small complaints. The first is that the pen nubs very easily come off. I put it in my pocket or my bag, and next time I go to pull it out, the pen part has come off. The same goes for the switch that extends the top part out. It is made to take off so you can reach the screw underneath in order to take it apart and put the batters in, it just snaps on and off, but I find it comes off pretty easily.Secondly is that it is plastic. For the price, I feel that at least the silver parts should have been metal. One of the iconic sounds aside from the buzzing that comes with the light is the little metal clinks every time the doctor extends it or flips it or stows it back in his pocket, and so I tend to find the plastic kind of lacking. Unfortunately, metal replicas are extremely expensive.Now, if the price were a bit less, $10 or $15 instead of over $20 then the plastic wouldn't bother me so much. Not counting that, it is still an excellent toy, well made, and looks great. (Though I think it might be a bit bigger than the one in the show). I don't regret buying it, and would recommend it to any fans of the show. But if you're a collector and really want an impressive replica, I'd consider some of the more expensive ones (not found on amazon unfortunately.)"
713,MSM Face & Body Lotion with Tea Tree Oil Medicinal Lotion,1/1,5.0,"I have no idea what happened to my first review [it's not listed here], so I'm going to write another one:Well firstly, I received the product and there was lotion all over the place [inside & outside the box]. I was very disappointed [who wants to buy lotion that costs $30 just for it to be wasted on delivery?]. So I did contact the seller and not only did he apologize, he sent me a 2nd lotion [that was properly packed in bubble wrap.I used it when I got it and it was amazing! Made my skin feel super soft and I love the smell of tea tree oil. This is a head to toe lotion, it can be used for anything. I will reorder when this one finishes :-)"
714,"Stress Free Emotions, 1000 mg, 60 herbal tablets",0/0,5.0,This product came to me in just a couple of days. It does help with the mood swings. I would recommend trying it.
715,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,1/1,4.0,"this is a fantastic bodywash! I use the Lavender 18-in One. All natural, non filmy....you will be SQUEAKY CLEAN. A little goes a long way so try to eyeball the amount you put on a scrubber accordingly. Smells lovely!"
716,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,0/0,5.0,"This amount Of diapers is a great price and put me through a whole month for diapers! Looking and comparing prices, this saved about about 20-25 dollars instead of purchasing boxes from Walmart."
717,"Lambert Kay Boundary Indoor/Outdoor Cat Repellent Pump Spray, 22-Ounce",0/0,1.0,"Rotting cilantro would be a good description for this product. I used it in the sun room to try to keep the cat out of an area with gravel. The fumes kept me out, but he was only briefly put off. After a couple of hours he was wandering around as usual, seeming to be not bothered by the spray (while I was holding my nose and avoiding the area). Ick. I tried a reapplication, but was met with the same results. For all of the interest he generally has in smells, this one doesn't deter him for more than 30 min."
718,Loaded Questions,2/7,1.0,I bought this game and thought it would great but have to agree with the other reviews - the questions fall into the who cares at allI looked through most of the cards and there were a few interesting questions - very fewDon't waste your money
719,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 10-Piece Magnetic Bug Catching Game,1/3,3.0,"This puzzle is really cute, fun, and durable, but as is the case with most children's puzzles, the pieces are long gone. I'm not sure where puzzle pieces go, but I suspect they're somewhere with the missing socks."
720,"Green Soap Tincture, 16 Oz",0/0,2.0,"Delivery was 10 times faster than expected due to proximity of suppliers location. Product is not USP grade soap and does smell like it contains large quantity of coconut oil, perhaps. Will not buy again because I seek pharmaceutical grade."
721,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,4.0,"This is the first Safety Razor that I purchased, and I'm relatively pleased with the razor. I originally bought it based on a recommendation from The Art of Manliness website regarding wet shaving. Although I do state that the razor is a great first razor, I found it to be quite mild, and decided to change to a more aggressive razor within just a month or two. This would be a great razor for the type of man who's looking to shave on a daily basis without the baby-butt-smooth shave, or for the guy who's not sure whether or not they want to transition to a double-edged safety razor from the multi-bladed razors.Another word of advice for the would-be safety razor shaver"
722,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,"Have always loved DR. Bronners, especially the peppermint soap. Used to buy it years ago and stopped due to the cost at some places. At Amazon it is reasonable and I am very happy to be buying it again!"
723,"NeilMed Sinus Rinse, Premixed 50 Sachets",0/0,3.0,Don't suck it up to get the saline solution deep into your sinuses. I did this and it pushed the infection deep into my sinuses. Made the infection much worse! Follow the directions
724,Red Door Perfume by Elizabeth Arden for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"Ever since buying this ""Perfume"" years ago I have had to have it daily! I'll tell you why. Since I have been using this fragrance I have had nothing but fantastic comments from both ladies and men! No matter where I'm at - grocery store - furniture store - working at a golf Country Club etc. both men and women always comment how WONDERFUL I smell and then they have to know what it is that I'm wearing. Men that have asked me have actually written it down so they could buy it for their wives! And women who ask want to buy it immediately too! I am not exaggerating. The other day I went into a Office furniture store to make a purchase. I was talking with the man who was taking my info. about a chair I was ordering and there was a lady who worked there sitting in the back of the room. I no sooner walk in the store and the lady says to me"
725,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,4.0,"I received my water-pik a couple of weeks ago, and I love it. I had a water-pik before this one, for about 40 years. It still worked , but the tips leaked and I could not find replacements.My only complaint is more of the standard tips should be included for more than 1 user."
726,FusionBeauty LipFusion Micro-Injected Collagen Lip Plump Color Shine,0/0,3.0,"I'm not sure if this was a brand new product. It came in a Fusion Beauty box, but was not sealed, and it felt and looked empty...as in I could see through the tube. The color is pretty, and maybe for the price, you only deserve a quarter of a tube! LOL I won't bother to return, but I won't buy LipFusion from this seller again. Just sayin."
727,Marina Betta Pals Kit,4/4,4.0,"Admittedly, I am not a fish purist. I was simply looking for a nice, compact fishtank for my 2.5-year-old to keep a betta in his room. I bought the Marina Betta Pals kit in green from a local box retailer and moved Pickle into his home. He ate, pooped, made bubble nests and was lively. He seemed very happy for the 3 years that he lived there before passing away, in spite of his small domain. My son is now almost 8 and on his second betta who has been with us for 2.5 years now. Again, every indication is that the fish is not unhappy with his surroundings. So yes, this is a small tank, but its small size is a bonus in a kid's room. It is easy to clean, easy to open to feed the fish, and has a lid to protect the fish from our curious cats and random Legos. And the fish just don't appear to be distressed in it."
728,"Twinlab Daily One Caps, Without Iron",0/0,4.0,This brand was highly recommended to me as a teen and I've been using it ever since. Dinged a star just because it can give nausea on an empty stomach and makes your pee change color.
729,Earth Science,0/0,5.0,I am allergic to coconut and I was looking for a shampoo without any coconut ingredients or derivatives that are used to make shampoo to lather. This is the only shampoo that I am aware of that does not have an ingredient like cocamidopropyl betaine which is a synthetic surfactant derived from coconut oil. There are arguments on the Internet disputing whether ingredients like cocamidopropyl betaine is an allergen. But each of us has to choose what works for our particular need.
730,Radio Flyer 12S Classic Walker Wagon,0/0,5.0,My 16 month old daughter has some physical delays and still isn't walking on her own and has an extreme fear of gravity so all walker toys are very scary to her and she just refuses to walk with. This one has done the trick! She doesn't feel like she's falling forward because of the retension wheels and it makes her feel more stable. Very well made toy that will stay in the family for many years to come!
731,Uncle Milton Solar System In My Room,3/3,1.0,"Awesome for educational puproses while it lasts... The problem with this toy is, the motor is cheap and breaks very quickly. Ours just stopped working out of the blue. Light turns on but nothing moves, and its still brand new. Cheap toy. You get what you pay for, but this shouldn't even be allowed to be sold. The uncle milton toy company is only after your dollar. They have no concept of care for the consumer or business ethics. Bottome line, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
732,"Invacare LightWeight Tracer EX2 Wheelchair 20"" with Swingaway Footrest-Blue (Folding, Assembled)",2/2,5.0,You can't beat the price for this wheelchair. Its great for transporting people in places like wal-mart and target. It is construted for the average person. I used it for a person that weighed 170lbs.. The footrest are made of plastic which is ok as long as you do not put all of your weight on it.
733,IQ Baby Knock-Knock Blocks,0/0,5.0,I bought these for my 5 month old daughter. I wanted to get her toys that don't light up and make noise and these blocks have been a hit! She can sit up on her own and I'll set the blocks up in front of her. She reaches out for them and chews on them. Hopefully soon she will understand the peek-a-boo windows when she gets a little older. Great choice for parents looking for toys that challenges the creativity in your child. One day I'd like to get her into Legos!
734,Munchkin Baby Care Cart,1/1,3.0,this product is very flimsey but i dont want to down talk any thing it was going to be for my baby cloths but it went to my other son for his hot wheel cars
735,4 pc. Pig Femur Bone,0/0,1.0,This lasted for less then 5 minutes before my APBT had it broken into sharp jagged slivers. If You have a large dog with strong jaws expect a trip to the vet if you give this to him
736,Tresemme Tresemme 24 Hour Body Healthy Volume Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"Tresemme Healthy Volume leaves my hair clean and gives good volume. Nice scent too. I could spend 2-5x more on a product and get the same results. The larger size is a great value. I have purchased this product from Amazon many times over the past few years. I have never been disappointed.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."

They are adorable and have been popular for a long time. I received this order on time and it was exactly what I had ordered. Will shop this seller again!
739,"JW Pet Company Giggler Ball Dog Toy, Big, (Colors Vary)",0/0,3.0,"I got this thinking it would make lots of noises, but it really only makes one type of noise. You really have to shake the ball hard in order for it to make noise, so it's a toy you can shake to get your dog excited, but then when you set it down for them to play with it, it goes silent. If you're looking for a noisy toy to keep them entertained, this wouldn't be my choice.Pros:JW Toy (which are always innovative)very durableit's a ball (not sure what more I can say)Cons:it doesn't do much unless a person shakes itonly makes one noisenot super exciting"
740,Gamma2 Vittles Vault Plus for Pet Food Storage,0/0,5.0,"This is SO awesome! I was positive it wasn't going to fit 15 lbs. of cat food, but I was wrong and it did! If you haven't seen one of these is person, you can't imagine how awesome it is. The seal is amazing and it is of such high quality, if you buy anything else to store your pet's food... you might be a fool. Just sayin'. Also, it comes with a handy scoop to dispense your pet's food and it fits in nicely. Buy this."
741,"Revolution Tea, 16 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",0/0,4.0,These teas are terrific. I love the Earl Grey with Lavender and the White Pear tea as well. I think the Ginger Peach may be my favorite though.
742,Step 2 Up & Down Roller Coaster,0/0,5.0,"My little grandaughter took her first trip down it and you should have seen the look on her face, LOL. She's gonna get used to it, it will just take time, she plays on the little car and the track, but you have to coax her into riding every time."
743,"Howard Hippo Mini Flopsie 8"" by Aurora",0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my grand-daughter. She absolutely loves it, takes it everywhere she goes. I've had to make special trips to go back and get it. Very well made and sturdy. This hippo gets lots of attention and hasn't suffered even one loose thread."
744,"Bona Stone Tile and Laminate Floor Cleaner Refill, 128-Ounce",2/2,5.0,"We have found laminate floors the best for withstanding children and pets. Although water can be used to clean some areas of laminate, cleaners specifically designed for laminate cleaning are usually the best for wide areas. Bona is hands down the best we have ever found!We try to clean the laminate floors weekly with Bona and to spot clean as needed with water for very small spots and with sprayed on Bona for larger spots. Our floors are doing well and look great."

747,"COVERLET OVAL BANDAGES, 1 1/4""",0/0,5.0,"These Coverlet bandages are the perfect size for facial wounds, whether accidently inflicted or from a dermatologist's procedure. In fact, my dermatologist uses these, but was unsure where the general public could get them (Amazon,of course!)They stick well, are fairly thin, noticeable on the face, but not obtrusively so. Great product along with the manufacturer's complete line."
748,Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,5.0,The delux seat cover was every thing I excepted. I was very pleased with its looks and fell as was my Dog.
749,Super Bio C - Buffered 1000 mg - 360 - Capsule,0/0,5.0,"Even though it was not easy to find this product somewhere else, I found it easly with you and the price was great. It was exactly what doctor prescribed because the vitamine C has to be released gradually in my body for a heart desease."
750,Kinesio Tex Tape,0/0,5.0,"After seeing athletes in the Olympics using this type of tape, my husband and I decided to try it. We are not olympic athletes, but bowlers who have foot and back troubles. I used it on my feet and they felt much better. My husband used it on his back and it helped him, too. Great product, great service, and great results! A+"
751,Earth Science A/B Hydroxy Night Rejuvenator,2/2,1.0,"I saw this product on Dr. Oz, so I ordered it. I have very sensitive skin...it cause a rash on my face. Unable to use it...waster of my money :-("
752,Sunsation Pool Float,1/1,3.0,"I bought this float when I learned that the one I really wanted from another company was out of stock until after the summer ended. The float is basically fine, except it is a little narrower and a little thinner than I expected. I ultiumately was able to get the originial Frontgate float that I had wanted, and it is considerably wider and thicker for about the same cost."
753,"JL Childress Standard and Dual Stroller Travel Bag, Black",0/0,4.0,"It was a great bag for the $, but would be better if they made a stroller bag with more shape and padding!"
754,Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed,0/0,3.0,"The cover is not what I call sherpa. It is not what sherpa looks like if you go to the Majestic webside and zoom in on the texture of the cover. It is soft but doesn't have the sherpa texture.Also, the bed comes in a box (from Majestic) folded in half. It took a couple of days for it to lay properly. I agree that this bed is very light weight. I am using it for 2 dogs that are each under 20 lb. Therefore, it is sturdy enough for them. I would not recommend it for a 50 lb. dog."
755,"Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure Conditioner, 6.8 Ounce",2/2,2.0,"I've been using Ciment Anti-Usure for five or six years now. I have fine, thin hair and it was the perfect conditioner for me. It made my hair soft and manageable with no flyaway static problems, even in the dead of winter. I just started using my first bottle of the new formula about a month ago, and I am not a fan. My hair looks limp and greasy, yet I have so much static going on my bangs constantly stick to my face. My natural wave is hardly noticeable with the new formula."
756,DKNY Be Delicious,0/0,5.0,"This is the best lotion ever! I love the Be Delicious scent and have been wearing it for years. It's very fresh and clean, and I get compliments (mostly from men) on it all the time. The lotion is considerably less expensive on Amazon than at my local department store. Shipping was fast, and product is exactly what I expected. I will buy this again and again."
757,PlasmaCar Blue,1/2,5.0,"We purchased this on the advise of my great nephews therapist. He has a very bad health situation that he was born with. He actually is using this bike to gain better control of his hands, arms,legs and ankle usage. It is a real A+ for certain illnesses, but please check with Doctors or Therapist, if this is why you're purchasing this bike. But as for the bike in general, all (3) of the kids love it, along with all thier friends. It also will handle up to 12o pounds."
758,Fascinations AntWorks Illuminated Blue,3/3,5.0,"I've always wanted an ant farm- but worried about them getting loose. As a night nurse I rented a commuter room for my daytime naps. I got this illuminated ant farm for my home away from home (and away from my 6 and 2 year olds whom I'm sure would have liberated the ants). Love it! The ants arrived alive by mail (N. Cali in mid-August). In preparation of the transfer to their new home, I taped the transport tube to my car's AC vent as I drove the 85 miles to work. I got to my rented room, poked 4 holes into the gel (along side the container's walls) and dumped the ants in. REMOVE THE TAPE FROM THE 2 TINY HOLES ON THE COVER CAP TO MINIMIZE CONDENSATION OF THE HABITAT. They busily engineered interconnecting tunnels. About 2 weeks in, I felt the ants were crowded with the excess ""gel-dirt"" from the tunnel making (from the gel surface to the roof was gel crumbs). So when I saw that the majority of the colony was chilling in the bottom-most chamber one afternoon, I popped the whole habitat into the fridge for 10 minutes, then dumped the excess gel (and about 5 of the ants) into the toilet and double flushed."
759,Halston 1-12 Cologne by Halston for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,I'm always a fan of Halston fragrance. They have a certain nice to smell property that makes you want to wear it everyday. I have ordered this before and will order again sometime.
760,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves...highly recommend the chamomile also
761,Small World Toys Imaginative Play Knight in Shining Armor - Black,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this costume set for my 2 year old son to attend a dress-up birthday party, so I didn't need anything well built or sturdy. I was pleasantly surprized when I received the costume! For the price I paid, (thirteen dollars including shipping), this is a great toy costume which will probably last through many more parties and possibly Halloween. My son is still too small (30 lbs. 37"" tall) for the perfect fit but I think I can easily make an adjustment."
762,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"The product was just delivered yesterday. Applied the polish to my nails and it was MUCH darker than the polish in the picture. After doing some research, the polish advertised in the picture is actually Chine Glaze Aquadelic. I will not be sending this one back, I still like the color, but it is much darker than I expected. It looks a little funny since I have a paler skin tone. It is also a matte finish. I expected a shiny finish since the polish is called ""china glaze"". The color is still pretty, but it definitely needs a top clear coat to make it shiny. If you want the polish color advertised in the picture, look up China Glaze Aquadelic polish."
763,Revell AG Germany 1/150 WASA Swedish Regal Sailing Ship Model Kit,2/2,5.0,"This is a new-release for Revell's Age of Sail ship line of kits. It's been a long time since they released anything new in this category, and they did a fine job with it! The Wasa is an actual Swedish Ship with an interesting story behind it...The kit itself is terrific! Being a new release, the kit's molds are very crisp...all the parts look great, with exceptional detail on all the ornately-decorated parts!And it looks beautiful when finished!Highly recommended!"
764,Rit Sun Guard Laundry Treatment UV Protectant - si,1/1,5.0,This stuff is great! I didn't realize one box is good for 20 washings! I wanted my baby to have sun protection without always putting sunblock on him. So this was great to wash into his clothes. Oder and film free. I wouldn't know it was there if he didn't have tan lines!
765,Torani Peach Syrup 750mL,0/0,5.0,"I saw this syrup in a coffee shop on campus, and decided to buy it to make my own peach iced tea. I don't want to keep going to coffee shop and spend 3ish bucks everyday to pay for something that I could make by myself. It is really simple to make TASTY peach iced tea at home. I just use some grey or green tea bag, this syrup and some honeyAmbrosia Pure Honey From Colorado's Western Slope, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4). Personally I don't want to use sugar because that's not as healthy and tasty as honey. So I use this honey which makes my peach iced tea taste so good."

767,Rusk w8less Strong Hold Shaping and Control Hairspray Hair Sprays,1/1,5.0,"I like this Rusk W8less Strong Hold Shaping and Control Hair Spray. It holds without being sticky, smells great. I like that this hairspray lasts a long time."
768,Bluebonnet Nutrition Natural Omega-3 Heart Formula,0/0,5.0,"My Doctor recommended both the ""Heart Formula"" and the ""Brain Formula"" and said to alternate taking them every other day. My Doctor believes in Western Medicine aided by ""Eastern Medicine"" and has recommended a number of supplements including Blue Bonnet Omega-3 formulas."
769,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,3.0,"Works fine given the following limitations; resivour is too small, i have to fill 1 & 1/2 times to clean at 2 seconds between teeth. The high power is too weak, should be increased."
770,"Lubriderm Lotion, 16 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I love this product and hope they don't discontinue it. It is both a lotion and sunscreen in one, and it works great, without the sunscreen smell."
771,Duncan,0/0,5.0,"As kids have so many electronics these days, I wanted to expose my grandchildren to a simple toy that give hours of entertainment. When they saw me ""Walk the Dog"" and ""Cradle the Baby"", they are now all playing with yo-yo's."
772,BioSilk Silk Therapy,1/1,5.0,"You can't beat the price. I bought this same bottle in w*lmart and paid $24! I was so ticked....I didn't realize the price would be so high until after checkout. Promptly returned it and bought a bottle on here instead. This stuff is like liquid gold (quality wise). It really makes your hair shine. One thing to be aware of though is that with the bigger bottles the product tends to separate so you need to really shake it up before you use it. Otherwise you get this weird, watery stuff."
773,CR2032 Maxell LITHIUM 5 BATTERIES,0/0,5.0,"I got my order, as described early. Which, I needed because my watch had died and I'm lost without it."

775,Vidal Sasson VS189 Gold Series Professional Full-size Straightener,0/0,4.0,"I have had this straightener for over 5 years. it still works wonderful, but recently i dropped it and cracked the frame so now the plates dont stay in. I was checking a few months a go to see if they still made them because i wanted to get a new one, and one for my sister. a few months a go it was only 49.99 and i was about to buy two, but things came up where i couldnt, and now with everything back in order, they are 76 dollars. how can it have gone up so much in a few months? I know that its salon price worthy, but when it was 29.99 when i had boughten it i was willing to pay the extra 20 dollars for a new one, but i dont know about an extra 45 dollars."
776,Deborah Lippmann Nail Lacquer,0/0,5.0,"This polish is great! I love it. It looks great alone one or more coats, and it also looks great over other polishes. It's one of the best glitter polishes I have used."
777,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,1/2,3.0,"I am so disappointed with this cheap product. I bought one of these a few years ago and my cats really liked it. It broke a long time ago. I bought this new one and I cannot tell you how cheap this is. What a waste of money! The feather comes off even though it has some kind of (obviously cheap) glue on it. The stick part is in two parts and I have no idea why! The second the cat bats at it, it falls off. The top of the stick will go flying off about 5 minutes in even if a cat doesn't bat at it because it is in two pieces. I have never been so disappointed with a cat toy. I really wish I didn't buy it. I also bought replacement feathers. So, I spent a lot of money and it's just a piece of crap. I will not buy this again. I gave it 3 stars because when it isn't being a piece of crap, my cats like it."
778,Tantus A Bomb Anal Plug,0/0,5.0,"When I first bought the A Bomb I was a complete noob and this plug refused to be inserted. For months I worked with theDoc Johnson Classic Butt Plug, Black, Mediumbut this plug just wouldn't pop. Finally, this thing went in smoothly a few weeks ago and it was UN FREAKIN REAL!! I am now inserting it with little to no effort and I am on my way to bigger plugs.Quality-wise this plug is top notch. The silicone is extremely smooth and the shape is absolutely perfect...it fits like a glove when I have it in. It's very easy to clean and paired with a good water-based lube likeMaximus Personal Lubricant 250 ml, it slides in very easily.If you have started to grow bored with the small/medium plugs and you feel the need to begin stretching the limits, this is the perfect plug to purchase. Yeah, it's not for beginners but it certainly is not the biggest plug out there. Trust me. Buy this and you will be very happy."
779,Sweet Paprika Tin,0/0,5.0,"awesome flavor and love the tin, does the tin come in a bigger size. well worth the money and the wait. I will be buying this one again."
780,Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed,0/0,3.0,"The cover is not what I call sherpa. It is not what sherpa looks like if you go to the Majestic webside and zoom in on the texture of the cover. It is soft but doesn't have the sherpa texture.Also, the bed comes in a box (from Majestic) folded in half. It took a couple of days for it to lay properly. I agree that this bed is very light weight. I am using it for 2 dogs that are each under 20 lb. Therefore, it is sturdy enough for them. I would not recommend it for a 50 lb. dog."
781,Revlon ColorSilk Beautiful Color Hair Coloring Products,0/1,1.0,"I am gray/blonde, rather was gray/blonde. Husband bought product for wht he though was a good product name and color. Did color swatch test and seemed okay. Did full head of hair and i now look like carrot top. Color is not true and really looks horrible. Should be removed from marked. Revlon should know better then to keep this line of products in market place. STAY AWAY"
782,Softie Pool Float,0/0,4.0,"This raft is very nice! Love that you don't have to blow it up! :) The kids love it in the pool. You will get wet when laying on it, but not entirely soaked. And it's easy to get on and off without flipping yourself into the pool. :)"
783,"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Pearl, .15-Ounces (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,I love this Revlon lipstick. It stays on a long time and it feels so good on the lips. Best lipstick I have found.
784,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,This polish wears great and lacks some of the chemicals other polishes have. The color is fantastic and will wear nicely into fall.
785,"Bounty Paper Towels, White, 15-Count Package",0/0,5.0,"These are good paper towels. They might seem pricey, but I haven't seen anything that beats them in terms of paper towels."
786,Kasugai - Lychee Candy 4.93 Oz.,0/0,5.0,"These candies have a very unique flavor, and it is a very yummy one at that! However, I think most people would enjoy the flavor because it is not 'odd' or too overbearing/strong. I would recommend these :)"
787,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,4/4,2.0,"I was surprised by the flimsiness of this product. It's solidly constructed from genuine cheap plastic parts (excluding the necessary metal for the battery pack) After opening the package the slide button immediately popped off. This is supposed to come loose to allow access to the screw that opens the battery case. However it is always loose and ready to pop off. Lifting my thumb off the button is often enough to pull it loose.The 'two distinct sounds' are barely discernible from each other even in a completely silent room. Press button once for sound one and again for a minutely different sound.The little UV light works perfectly.My sonic arrived with one working pen nib (the ink pen) and one dry pen nib (the UV pen) I can only assume this toy has been sitting in a warm place for a very long time because the UV pen nib was sealed in factory shrink wrap but was still bone dry when it arrived.The suggested 'fix' for this is either add water to the nib. (we all know how well that works) or buy a new one. (oh, I see)The batteries are easily installed but you will need a very small screwdriver to do so. (an actual screwdriver) Which is kind of funny when you think about it.This toy is cute, it's fun to have, but I wouldn't purchase this for anyone under the age of 13. It's simply too delicate to survive any serious 'play'. It's a little overpriced for a novelty pen even if it is in the shape of a sonic."
788,"K. Hall Designs Milk (Vanilla, Coconut & Milk) Scented REFILL OIL for Reed Diffuser",0/0,2.0,"This does not smell anything like vanilla, coconut or milk. I love all these scents and have purchased many products that are scented with vanilla, coconut or milk, and this smells nothing like any of them."
789,"LifeSavers Wild Cherry Hard Candy, 12 - 6.25-Ounce Bags",0/0,5.0,"20 packs gone in a matter of weeks. I am so glad amazon carries these, because stores stopped selling them. These are the real deal if you love wild cherry hard candy!"

It uses std 9 volt batteries Lower cost!It has been good for 3 years+ but recently started flashing after new battery insertedManual says remove battery & hold correction level set button ""until the light goes out"" There was no light so held for a few sceonds only -- no better . Petsafe tech said $40 for replacement receiver . I tried a new approach I held the correction set button for about 30 seconds even tho the light was out all the time . Installed new battery & everything works again! Typical battery life has been 6 months+ This model is still available & is a better option I think."
791,Giselle Perfume by Carla Fracci for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,1.0,I bought this perfume from nordstrom a couple years ago and loved it!!! I was so sad when they stopped selling it but totally excited to find it on here. But it smells awful like super cheap perfume in the same packaging. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want to smell like you bought musk from the dollar tree. The worst thing about it is that you can't return it so i am stuck with a $40 bottle of super smelly perfume!!
792,Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush,0/0,5.0,"I used to buy this brush at a local Beauty Supply store, but it doesn't sell it anymore. It is perfect for my hair. My hair tangles easily and most brushes either tear it or are too soft to brush through it. This one is just right. I' so glad they still make it and I found it on Amazon!"
793,Kong Zoom Groom For Cats,0/0,3.0,"This is OK, but my cat prefers the 2-sided brush I got at Target - black plastic bristles/metal pinhead bristles. She has long hair, and the massage idea doesn't work well for her - messes up her hair. She's also sensitve on her body, so she doesn't like to be massaged with the fairly hard rubbery teeth, and she loves gentle brushing with the black bristles on the sides of her face - she loves it so much that she jumps up into the brushing...The bristles don't feel sticky to me (some reviewer said they attract the hair to it), and I don't find it easier to clean than the first brush I got; nor does it work as well in removing loose hair. Regarding cleaning, I prefer the Safari self-cleaning slicker brush which cleans itself beautifully with the press of a button - all the hair comes off in one neat rectangle; it also removes more loose hair, and I like the color of green Safari brush and the gripper handle. I have to be extra carefulwith that brush thoughbecause the bristles are so thin and stiff that it could easily scratch the cat."
794,HTP Plantar Fasciitis Heel Seats,1/1,5.0,"I was encouraged by other reviews to purchase the HTP Heel Seats for my trip to Israel. All other inserts had not helped but the Heel Seats were the best for my ""All Terrain"" sport shoes trekking all over the country and walking through the different airports to make our connecting flights. In the beginning, it is uncomfortable to have any insert in one's shoes but eventually, I could no longer feel the pain and could walk for longer periods with no trouble.I highly recommend HTP Heel Seats to Plantar sufferers. They really work."
795,Educational Insights Safe 'n' Easy Paper Cutter,0/0,4.0,This is definitely a solid and nice looking paper cutter however the reason i rated 4 stars is that it takes me a couple or three cuts to get the cut where i want it. Kind of annoying but i got used to it. The cuts are clean and the product is durable but the alignment needs to be where the clear plexiglass ends but it's not.
796,"Ethical Laser Flashing Ball Dog Toy with Sound, 2-1/2-Inch",3/3,1.0,"On the very first toss, my beagle chomped on this ball and separated the two halves. To be fair- the package says ""Not a chew toy"", but does anybody have a dog that doesn't bite on their toys? The idea of this product is a good idea. The implementation is poor."
797,Midwest Life Stages Single-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,1/2,2.0,"We purchased this crate several weeks ago for our new dog, who's a 10 month old husky mix, weighs about 55 lbs. We got him a crate that's a big larger than he needs, so he wouldn't feel too trapped. He immediately figured out how to break out of the thing. The clips on the side bent around immediately, so we used pliers to wrap them around a little more tightly. Again, he figured out how to squeeze through the seams within a couple of minutes. I'm very disappointed in the quality. I'd return it but I don't have the box or receipt anymore.If anyone has suggestions for a better solution, please let me know."
798,Lifesavers Candy Spearomint Flavored Candy (20 count),0/0,3.0,"The internet is great in that you can find many lost items here, but the fact is most prices are well above the store cost. Guess if I can't find it locally, I'll do without."
799,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,0/0,5.0,"I gave this product for a baby gift 3x & everyone who received was so pleased to get it. Even though the babies are too young to play with it now, the parents are having a great time checking it out. I will probably buy more of these as gifts as the babies keep on coming!"
800,Marina Decorative Gravel - 1 lbs,0/0,5.0,The gravel arrived very promptly and is very nice. I am using it in a very small container and it looks pretty and serves the purpose I intended it for. I would recommend it to anyone needing a small amount of gravel.
801,"CaribSea Eco-Complete 20-Pound Planted Aquarium, Black",1/1,5.0,"Plants are growing, looks good with the tank, the only thing I reccomend is rinse it a few times, I rinsed it 3 times before I put it in the tank, & when I did put it in the tank after that, it still made the tank a brown color, but after about 8 hours it was crystal clear."
802,The Original N-Bone Chicken Large 6.5 Inch Single,0/0,2.0,My dog obviously loved her new bone but it lasted less than 5 min. I give her a bone when I leave to keep her occupied since she has separation anxiety. She finished this bone before I had a chance to get out the door. In my opinion this bone costs too much to last such a little amount of time
803,Learning Resources Pretend & Play Doctor Set,1/2,5.0,"We bought this doctor's kit for our kids when they were in early preschool (one was a toddler) and they played with this on and off straight through kindergarten. This kit has a lot of tools they need for their pretend medical profession. The case it comes with makes for good storage and is pretty sturdy. (The toddler couldn't open the latch, but the preschooler could!) It would be cool if the blood pressure gauge really compressed, but oh well, it's pretend."
804,"Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Sleepytime, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",2/2,5.0,"Prior to discovering the sleepytime tea, it would take me at least an hour to fall asleep and even then, I'd wake up 2-3 times throughout the night. I didn't want to take any sleep medicine because I feel like its a little risky so I looked for a more natural remedy and this tea is it! I usually drink it 30 minutes-hour before bedtime and it relaxes me and once I lay down, I'm out within minutes and can usually sleep through the night. My only advice would to be careful of the amount of liquid you consume right before lights out otherwise you'll be waking up for other reasons. Like another user observed, drinking from a small cup will do.Also, I've tried other sleepy teas and so far, this is the most effective and has a light, calming taste. They also make it in vanilla which is also very good."
805,"Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Split Pea Soup with Barley, 2.5-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"My husband and I both love Dr. McDougall's dehydrated soups.

808,"SlimFast Shake Mix, 12.83-Ounce (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,"I really enjoy the Slim Fast Powdered drinks. I've never used the prepared drinks. But what I like about the powders is I can throw in all kinds of fruit in to the Vanilla drink or instant coffee in to the Chocolate drink. I usually have one drink for lunch and it really does fill me up, and it ""tastes just like candy"". (I Love Lucy)."
809,"Lamaze Play & Grow Take Along Toy, Firefly",0/0,5.0,"I usually do not write reviews, and now that I have 7 week old baby at home I do not have much free time to do so either. However, this little interesting looking toy is so great and I wanted to write few words. This is the first toy that my LO actually seemed interested in, kept her busy for about 10-15 minutes at a time even on a very fussy day. I could not thank it enough for allowing me to take a break and regroup myself. Thanks Freddie! :)"

816,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Homemade Wonderful Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",1/1,1.0,"I love most Bob's stuff, but I bought this bread mix and made rolls. I had two in one day and woke up with terrible stomach pains the next morning. As most of us who must stay gluten free do, I went over in my mind what I had had to eat the day before and these rolls were the only new thing. I then researched garbanzo beans. They are in the soybean family. My doctor has told me that I must also be careful of soy as well as milk unless it is lactose free. The garbanzo beans were the problem so I had to go to another brand with the other types of flour. If you don't have a problem with soy, the rolls were very good. Wonderful taste and very soft. However, you may need to stay away from it if you are allergic to soy also."
817,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,0/0,1.0,"I know they listed that it was small, but this is ridiculously small.It's more like a small toy for cats. They really should put somethingnext to it to show the true size."

I have been keeping this device by my desk for those situations. I also like the fact that the case is attached to it so that it always has protection when not in use.I just drove to a restaurant only to find that I could not read the menu because I forgot my reading glasses. I am now ordering a second unit to keep in my car in case of emergencies of this sort. I think it will be more portable and useful than keeping a second pair of reading glasses."

825,ThinkFun Zingo,3/4,3.0,"Game is extremely well made and durable - since the chips with the pictures are made out of plastic I can see this game lasting a long time. I bought this for my 5 and 8 year old - all in all they seem to like it, but one suggestion I would make to anyone who is buying it is have at least three people - two kids playing and a parent to make the chips come out. When allowing the boys to play on their own (so both have cards to fill and one of them is operating the chip releaser) the child releasing the chips ""hovers"" over them so they are usually the one to first say and grab the chip...which results in fights."
826,Callebaut Baking Cocoa Powder 2.2lb. bag,1/1,5.0,Callebaut Baking Cocoa Powder is the best cocoa I have ever baked with. It makes you cake richer with a more chocolatey taste. I baked a red velvet cake and my daughter ate a piece she said that other other red velvet cakes she has eaten was not as chocolately as mine I told her it was the cocoa that I purchased at Amazon. Can't wait until I try it again. I tell everyone this is the best cocoa powder ever.
827,Ohropax Ohropax Wax Ear Plugs 12 plugs,1/1,5.0,"I live in the lower level of a house with wood floors and no sound dampening... The kitchen is directly above my room allowing me to hear everything that happens in the morning...literally, everything.. A fork drops,I hear it.. someone taps on the counter, I hear it. Someone walks across the floor with anything besides socks and I hear ""thump thump thump thump""... There is also this cross beam in the ceiling that grows and shrinks all day making this ticking sound constantly. There isn't more than a couple of minutes that goes by without this damn thing creaking. I drives me nuts. I finally got my act together and bought these ear plugs and the first night of use I fell in love. These have allowed me to lay down in my bed again without playing a ""sleep music"" video from the internet to cover up the sound. I have been taking one plug and splitting it in half and putting that in my ear so I do not have a huge glob of wax up in my ear. I highly recommend this product."

It could be all in my head, but I like and use it on the regular. amazon.com had it for such a good price that I purchased two bottles. I do not like the drops, the spray is what works for me.Thanks"
829,Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper,0/0,5.0,"I had been using a set of nail clippers from the 1970's. They were just worn out. We bought some other clippers at the grocery store or drug store and they were awful - not as good as the old ones. So I decided to shop for a better quality clipper and got these Seki fingernail and also some Seki toenail clippers. I never thought that nail clippers could be this good. I love them. Admittedly, I'm not a clipper connoisseur, but these things are as sharp as the samurai swords they claim to be associated with."
830,"Vitol 100% Egg Protein, 12 oz (340 g)",0/0,4.0,"I've tried a bunch of different egg protein powders which I use daily in a blender shake. I have used a lot of this Vitol product, the NOW product and the Optimum Nutrition product. All are roughly comparable in price, with the vanilla Now being 8% more at this time and the Optimum Nutrition chocolate costing 42% more (using the best deals on Amazon now).Optimum Nutrition one of the best tasting and easiest mixing. It also has a nice fluffy consistency that blends easily without caking up on the sides of the blender like some brands. It has some ingredients some may object to- artificial flavors and sweeteners. It has the best looking jar.Between the pure protein NOW powder and the vanilla Vitol, the Vitol is a bit less expensive in the 40oz size but more appealing, better tasting, and mixes up a little better. The Vitol is flavored and sweetened naturally with stevia.I use 100% egg powder because it is cholesterol free, amino-acid balanced and milk-free. Balanced vegan protein powders can be expensive and soy or pea products can be hard to digest; soy also has negative nutritional factors and female hormone analogs. Milk-based powders can have lactose or allergens for some people.So for me egg protein powder is a great way to get protein that is easy to digest, allergen free, inexpensive and low calorie (free of fats and carbs).NOW Foods Eggwhite Protein, 1.2 PoundOptimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound"

Hanging this on wall was the best thing we ever did! Not only have we out smarted the rodents/raccoon's.....MUCH easier on my bad back! No longer do I have to bend over, remove bricks from lid (made it harder for raccoon's) of container! I now just walk up and pull the lever! YOU GOTTA BUY ONE!"
833,"Coffee-Mate French Vanilla, Sugar-Free Powdered Coffee Creamer, 10.2-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Was very happy indeed to find this product -- no longer available in our markets here. Best-tasting, sugar-free, and powdered - no need to refrigerate."
834,Four Paws Easy Feeder for Pets,0/0,2.0,"I bought these to dose an aquarium with fertilizer and fill small test tubes. They didn't work out, though. After less than two months they started to become rough and eventually bind. I realize that my application isn't conventional, but I think the issues I had also apply to their intended use.The good:-The markings have held up well, though they are starting to fade. Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long. In my case their useful life was only two months while being used every one or two days.-The plungers lock when depressed all the way, which makes extracting something difficult because you have to pop it loose. I don't understand why their designed that way, but if someone knows of a reason for it, then feel free to post a comment."
835,The First Years Disney Soft Potty Seat,0/0,5.0,"I started my daughter with the bjorn potty seat and she absolutely hated it! It makes potty training super rough when your kid loathes their potty seat. I decided to go a cheaper route and bought this one because she loves princesses and I thought maybe a padded seat would be more novel. It was perfect for her! She especially liked the handles on the sides just to hold on to. Plus, it is very lightweight and she can pop it on herself without adjusting it. I can see how this could fall off the toilet if it sticks to their behind but if your child has good motor skills it shouldn't be a problem. My 2 year old is having no issue getting on/off the potty with this herself with the aid of a stool to step on. Definitely would recommend this seat as an economical choice."
836,Almased Almased Multi Protein Powder,4/6,1.0,"I was really excited to try this after reading all the health benefits. Thank goodness a co-worker gave me some to try before I bought any. Tried the first serving with filtered water, eeekkkk, had to gag it down. It tastes like sawdust! I used a magic bullet for 5 minutes to blend it and it still settled at the bottom.2nd serving I used 1% milk and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. Not much improvement.Before I tried it I was going to do the 14-day starting phase. No way I could gag this down 3 times a day for 14 days, let alone ONE day!Really wish it tasted and dissolved better."
837,Mrs. Meyer's All Purpose Cleaner 32 fl oz (946 ml),0/0,5.0,This is a great cleaner. I got this mainly because it has no chemicals. It really cleans well. I have no complaints.
838,"PetSafe Deluxe Bark Control Collar, PDBC-300",1/1,4.0,"This is a great product. It does what it says it does, is very user friendly and as long as I keep it on my dog he doesn't bark. He has become smarter than than bark collar. He knows if it's off he can bark freely. I just wish there was a separate on and off switch so u can save battery power because they only last about 30 days. I would defiantly recommend this product."
839,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,1/1,4.0,I have only had the opportunily to use this Hot Iron Curling Iron a few times but at this time I am very pleased with it.
840,"Vero Mango, Chili Covered Mango Flavored Lollipops, 40 Pieces",2/2,5.0,This is one of the many Mexican Candies that me and my sister used to eat as a children. The package arrived the first day of the estimated arrival time given. If you have tried these candies before you know what your getting and they are exactly what I remember. I will most definatly buy more products from this company/seller! Yummy!
841,Nicorette Gum,0/0,5.0,This works as good as you want it to. I'm hooked on it because I havn't tried to wean myself off of it. It's better than smoking but just as expensive.
842,"California Baby Hair De-tangler Spray - Calming, 8.5 Ounce",0/0,2.0,"We love the way this smells, and I love that it's natural. Sadly it doesn't work very well. I won't buy it again."
843,Hot Paprika Tin,0/0,4.0,Product is great but container needs easier access. There is no shaker and product must be removed with a measuring spoon that fits the opening.
844,TY Beanie Baby - FRANKENTEDDY Bear (various colored feet),1/1,5.0,"I just received my Frankenteddy in the mail yesterday after very prompt shipping so I was very pleased with that. I was expecting a bear closer to the picture or just varying from the picture just slightly. I was ecstatic when I opened the envelope, the protective plastic bag he was wrapped in and saw that he has one purple foot(left) and one red foot(right) that actually has a 'scar' on it. His colors are amazingly vibrant and every time I look at the little guy I can't help but smile. He even has his tag in brand new condition. I'm very pleased with my purchase and will use this seller again."
845,"Conair HGL1 Combination Hot Gel/Lather Machine, Black",0/0,4.0,"I've been using my hot gel/lather machine for about a week now and I'm pretty happy with it. I will have to update this review at a later date once I've tried the machine with gel (I've only used lather), but it seems to work fairly well. Is the lather going to burn your skin coming out? Definitely not. But it's not cold either. It works and is decently heated. I also think the lather comes out less messy than previous (and more expensive) machines I've owned. It has automatic turnoff if you forget to hit the off button. It is a little tricky attaching the bottle to the cap of the machine, but once you correctly get it on, it works well.There is one drawback- you can't shake the can of shaving cream easily while it is in the machine. Thus, your lather comes out someone wet, rather than creamy. I'm thinking I'll have better luck with that once I switch to shaving gel.UPDATE (12/06/12)"
846,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,0/0,5.0,"I need a raelly powerful dryer for my hair.I have extreemly resiliant curly hair.I just have to wear it straight.After my last dryer caught fire I was worried that I may not find another one that could straighten my hair.After trying two out, I found this one on Amazon.Best dryer I have had since moving from the UK.Would recommend to everyone .It really does straighten my hair.Believe me that is a hard task.Now I just need to find a hairdresser that can do the same when I get my hair done!"
847,StoneTech 0703-0022 Revitalizer Fresh Citrus Tile and Stone Cleaner Wipes,0/0,5.0,I have granite in bathrooms & kitchen. These wipes are a must have for quick cleaning! They smell decent and leave a nice shine! Kinda pricey but worth the $!!
848,Nature's Way Aloe Maxlax,0/0,5.0,This product was recommended by a friend for occasional constipation as gentle but effective and it is both. I would definitely recommend it others and buy it again myself in the future.
849,ThinkFun Zingo,1/1,5.0,"Perfect for my 3 year old. As adults, we play the adult games (Yahtzee and stuff) and the little guy is left out. We always throw a round of Zingo in and everyone has to play. My 3 year old had no trouble figuring out how to play this game and is learning about rules (which is awesome). The adults even get a little competitive when playing. lol Would definitely recommend to others. I love the way you slide the thing forward to get the next two tiles of play, etc. Better than bingo where you have those balls that go everywhere. And it's perfect for my son's age as it's like a smaller version of bingo...you don't have to play very long for a winner."
850,"Alessi Thin Breadsticks, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",1/1,5.0,These breadsticka taste great with Nutella. I looked all over & could find them nowhere but here; was relieved when I found them here. Now I just have to wait until they get here. =/
851,Queen Helene Facial Masques (Masks),0/0,4.0,It's a little bit dry after I used this masque. Guess better not use it too often. 1 time per week will be fine.
852,"KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Red",3/3,5.0,"When I first got my lab/aussie puppy, he would eat so fast that he'd make himself ill. The trainer suggested that I stuff his food into a Kong and make him work for it. 14 months later, he no longer scarfs his food, but he still loves his Kong. I've read tons of blogs, and the Kong site itself, on how to stuff a Kong and what to stuff it with. I find variety is the best, so while I use the same base ingredients, I toss in something special each time. I currently have 4 Kongs that I rotate between the dog, the dishwasher, and the freezer. I plug the hole in the bottom with a baby carrot, layer in kibble, unsweetened applesauce, shredded meat or canned food, plain Greek yogurt, chopped veggies or fruit, peanut butter or almond butter, broken treats-- whatever I have on hand, then into the freezer it goes. I try to make the first layer he gets something motivating, like applesauce or peanut butter, and the bottom layer something easy, like kibble. The deepest layer is hardest to get to, and the hardest to clean, so I want to be sure he can get it out. (If you decide to stuff your Kong this way, a good quality bottle brush is a must) My dog will spend at least an hour working on emptying the Kong. I have hard wood floors and while I've never noticed a mess from it, it might be different on carpet."
853,"Sweet Sentiments OR Sweet Success Cookie, Candy and Snacks Gift Tower",0/1,5.0,"I got this basket of treats for my wife and it came looking just like the picture, ALSO, she loved EVERYTHING in it! The only thing that was bad is the speed at which this item(s) will disappear!"
854,Liz Claiborne Lucky You Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"This has been my favorite fragrance for years. Its hard to find,so I always order on Amazon. Its very light and airy and not too perfumey..great summer and spring scent."
855,"Synergy Pet Calm, 2 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"1300+ mile trip and my cat remained bright-eyed, yet calm and relaxed. When I arrived at my new home, he searched around and quickly made himself right at home. Would definitely buy again!!"
856,Carex Cervical Collar,0/0,5.0,"I have neck/shoulder pain and got this to support my neck when I have to look down at various documents for more than a few minutes. it works great. It is supportive but still allows motion. The Velcro is perfect. I put it on and take it off up to 10 times in one day, as the type of work changes - I don't need it for computer work. The Velcro still works just fine. Great product."
857,Giant Microbes Red Blood Cell (Erythrocyte) Plush Toy,0/0,5.0,"I collect Giant Microbes and currently have over 50 of them, so I know my microbes. Red blood cell is one of my favorites because it actually looks like it has a face with the eyes and a ""mouth."" These plushies are soft and cuddly, yet very informative. The tag on this one has a nice mix of science and colloquialisms, along with a few puns and sentences about donating blood. Almost everyone knows what a red blood cell is (and this one's adorable), so I give these out as gifts to teachers and fellow biology nerds."
858,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I have a 6 month old pit bull / lab mix and he's famous for tearing up toys & eating noses, eyes, etc. As soon as I received this it became his instant favorite. It isn't a challenge for him to get the squirrels out anymore - he just shakes the tree until they all go flying out. It's bigger than I thought it would be (which is wonderful). The squirrels fit just right and his mouth so he can squeak them fast and furiously. The squirrels have stitched eyes and noses so I don't have to worry about him swallowing any eyes. He loves to just play with the tree and we have ferocious tug of war matches. After over a week so far so good...except one of the squirrels split at the head but that was my fault for playing tug of war with it & him. The tree is a lot more durable for that. As always I'd recommend supervision with this toy because I'm not sure how long it would really last if he had some time to try and destroy it. Anyways I'm extremely pleased and this is always the first toy he gets out of his box & he's got over 50 or so to choose from..."
859,Olbas Olbas Herbal Bath,1/1,5.0,"i love Olbas oil. it foams up nicely, smells great and is made of all natural products - no chemical nasties. i prefer the UK packaging, however. The USA packaging makes the product look dated and even unappealing. The UK packaging is modern and smart. Unfortunately, it's on the expensive side in the USA, mostly likely because it's imported and the exchange rates aren't good. But you can buy it dirt cheap at grocery stores on your next trip to the UK."
860,OPI Rapidry Top Nail Coats,1/1,5.0,"I dont know how i went without this product for so long! It really works amazingly great to dry nails quickly. I have a tendancy to polish right before bed- and used to always have the problem of waking up to ruined nails- not anymore. Just a couple sprays of the rapid dry and waiting just a few mins, I can go to bed without worrying about my nails getting ruined. I honestly dont know if i can ever go without this stuff now!"
861,Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models & others,0/0,5.0,the batteries are working perfectly and the shaver is like new again. they are not easy to install but not impossible either.
862,"Reflections Heavyweight ""Looks Like Silver"" Disposable Flatware for 40 with BONUS Pack of 40 Forks - 160 Pieces in All",0/0,5.0,Purchased for my wedding. Very happy with product and price. Shopped at several places and this was the best deal.
863,Bluebonnet Nutrition Pycnogenol 100 Mg,0/1,4.0,"I have been taking them but honestly I don't know if is working..I'd recommend it either way, can't go wrong with vitamins right"
864,"Energizer D Alkaline Industrial Batteries, Box of 12",5/5,2.0,"Caution! I bought these batteries for my battery-run small camping fan. Unlike batteries used in flashlights, in this usage the batteries need to deliver a sizable pulse of high current at the start to get the fan motor turning from its stopped position. These don't do it! I've found that syndrome with no-name batteries, but I never expected it to happen with one of the oldest battery name products. Meanwhile some ""Varta"" batteries (made in Germany) that I bought at Parts Express did the job with NO problem. Likewise some Duracells I used a while ago.I was very disappointed."
865,FertilAid for Women,1/1,3.0,"I was hesitant to try this given the negative reviews, and because I ovulate regularly on my own. I purchased this product hoping to extend the length of my luteal phase, which is typically 10 days. After 4 months of taking as recommended, I didn't see a change in my cycle at all, so I stopped. I do take FertilCM as well and find that very helpful."
866,Bare Escentuals BareMinerals,0/0,5.0,I am so glad that I purchased this product
867,Pangea Organics Hand & Body Lotion - Pyrenees Lavender with Cardamom Body Lotions,0/0,5.0,All the pangea products are excellent and i use them all the time and also give as gifts. I will continue buying this product.
868,Gardenia Eau de Parfum for Women by Elizabeth Taylor,2/2,2.0,"Not only does it NOT smell anything like gardenias...the fragrance totally disappears after like 2 hours. I was looking for a reasonably priced fragrance to wear to work, but sadly this is not it.Guess you get what you pay for. Liz could have done a lot better with this one.:("
869,Neutrogena Neutrogena Clean Volume Body Enhancing Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful shampoo, especially as I am sensitive to ingredients and fragrances. Leaves hair squeaky clean with lots of hair volume."
870,Zen Reflections Juniper Bonsai,0/0,3.0,"Had I seen what I was getting ahead of time I probably would have not purchased this plant. I suppose this is not something you can't mass produce so what you get may or may not fulfill your expectations. My Bonsai was packed with Styrofoam ""peanuts"" which went all over the place when I opened it. Despite the packing there was some damage to the little fisherman and his pole. The plant itself is little more than a single twig bent at an angle and really does not resemble a miniature tree unless you apply a lot of imagination. Judging by the pictures, I gather you may luck out and get a nice looking one so before you order, you have to ask yourself, are you feeling lucky? One other thing, the little ""pond"" does not hold water. There were no instructions on caring for it but my daughter gave me some tips. I mist it several times a day and it seems to be healthy enough, just not that much to look at relative to what I hoped it would be."
871,Faconnable Cologne by Faconnable for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"This product has gotten me more comments than any other cologne I've worn, in a positive way. Not real strong smelling, just right and lasts all day."
872,"Almay Clear Complexion Makeup, (VARIED COLORS) 1 fl oz (30 ml)",0/0,5.0,"Love this foundation!! It's perfect for acne prone skin. I've read somewhere that you can build it to full coverage. I still couldn't have a really full coverage but got to high medium, which pleased me well. It spreads well and will not ever cause breakouts. It's supposed to actually help breakouts end but I could not actually test this because when I got it, my breakout was nearly over.But I give it 5 stars and I love it, will order it as long as my skin is prone to breakouts!"
873,Herbs For Kids Eldertussin Elderberry Syrup,0/0,5.0,"It works perfect! The only type of medicine we use for coughs! Just call the # on the bottle for dosage, other than that, get it!"
874,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,5.0,"My Conair clippers were supposed to be cordless with a rechargeable battery, but after a few years my husband had to leave it plugged in 24 hours a day (not merely when using it) in order for it to run at all. I finally decided I was tired of having the cord lying across the bathroom counter all the time, so I bought these clippers based on the other reviews. Having a corded clipper is not a hassle at all. My husband is thrilled!"
875,Siphotrol Plus Area Treatment For Homes-24 oz. spray,0/0,5.0,Was suspicious that fleas had been brought into our home and gotten into our rugs. Used Siphotrol Plus and have seen no further signs of our pet itching or being bothered by fleas. Think this is a great product!!
876,Manic Panic Semi-Permanent Color Cream,0/0,5.0,Product came earlier then it was saposed to &lt;3 and perfectly packaged. The color is also a great lime green.
877,DCL High Potency C Scape Serum 25 1.75 oz,0/0,4.0,I love this stuff. It really makes my face feel good and not greasy. I used it on my chest as well.
878,Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,1/1,3.0,I bought this specifically because the reviews said it fit perfectly with the prince lionheart diaper warmer. Well...the warmer can sit on top but it moves around easily. I can see that it works well with disposible wipes containers and while your infant is immobile. But as soon as they start to reach and grab its all over! Great organizer...but doesnt work with the wipes warmer.
879,"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White",1/1,5.0,"I bought this mattress used (I only read LATER that this is not a good idea due to bacteria, but I've also read that new mattresses have to off-gas or they, too, can cause your baby problems. Stay away from the internet re"
880,"Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Earplugs, Value Pack, 6 pr",0/0,5.0,Very pleased with purchase. They mold well to ear. Have restful sleep with sound reduction provided. Would recommend and buy again.
881,"NatraTaste Zero Calorie Sweetener, 250-Count Packages (Pack of 8)",0/0,5.0,"I have been using this great product for years. It has NO aftertaste and I have enjoyed it in my coffee and cereal. I got a shock today. I went to purchase if from Raley's--not there. I went to two Save Mart stores, and Safeway--gone. No one is carrying this any more. They have some substitute crap in its' place. I will not stock up from this site. If you wants yours, you had better find it and get it QUICK! I don't know why the stores stopped carrying it, other than to carry their own brand, or a wanna be substitute."
882,Flexi Classic 1 Small 16-Foot Retractable Leash,0/0,5.0,Love this leash allows my Teddybear puppy to roam about on his own while walking him. The quality is excellent. He weighs 17 pounds.
883,Dymatize Nutrition Elite Whey Protein Powder,0/0,4.0,"So I am not one to base a review of a protein on just taste. I gave this 4 starts because the protein powder itself is great! At a great price per serving it also packs high protein with low sugar and low fat which is excellent and what mostly everyone is looking for. I do Crossfit and Dymatize was actually recommended by my coaches (I just got off the vegan wagon!) I bought the berry blast because my brother told me the taste was very good I guess I could blame my brother instead lol)Anyway, the berry was disgusting. I tried mixing it with a banana and some other stuff to make it better and that acidic taste just wouldnt go away.I would highly recommend getting this product jsut dont get berry blast unless you are already a fan of it. Stick to the simple vanilla which tastes great!"
884,Educational Insights Pots 'N' Pans Set,0/0,5.0,"my son is 17 months old and he loves this set. he plays with it everywhere, even in the pool.nice colors and very durable"
885,Peter's Woven Grass Play Ball,0/0,5.0,My bunny LOVESSSSSSSSSSSSS this toy as soon as she sees it she runs towards it! I don't know why people keep saying that this comes with a bell inside because it doesn't.
886,"Nuun Active Hydration, Box of 4 Tubes",0/0,5.0,"I think that is a very good product, is in line with my expectations and I arrive in estimated time. I appreciate the service they give"
887,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"This was a gift for my grandmother, she has worn white diamonds for as long as I can remember. It's great that you can get perfume online for half of the cost at a retailer."
888,Light Relief 90LR15LR01 Infrared Pain Relief Device,0/0,4.0,This is a great product. I use it to recover from soreness after my workouts. My ankle hurts profusely after I run but after thirty minutes under the Light Relief the pain is gone. I wish I had invested in a product like this years ago. The only downfall is there's no way to control the heat element. It becomes unbearable after about ten minutes. Other than that it's great. I may have to order the larger pad to go along with it.
889,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,1/1,3.0,"The price was good, however, it should indicate somewhere, that these big packages diapers are not the same quality of diaper as the regular smaller packages, you can get elsewhere. They are thinner and don't hold as much wetness in the diaper. So you have to change the diaper more frequently, therefore, is it really worth it in the end?"
890,"Precious Cat Cat Attract Problem Cat Training Litter, 40 pound bag",2/2,5.0,"This product is a MIRACLE! Ever since the day my I brought one of my cats home she has had REFUSED to urinate in the litter box. For the past five years I have had to buy puppy pads to place in front of the litter box for her to use, rather than my carpet or any absorbent fabric in the house. I have been using cat attract for just about 5 days so far and she has been using it ever since! THANK YOU cat attract!!!"
891,Promensil Promensil,1/1,5.0,"This is the best meonpausal relief product I have tried! I have been taking it for less than a month and already my hot flashes, moodiness, and irratability are virtually gone! I am a happy camper!!!"
892,Aubrey Organics,6/7,1.0,"LOOK AT THE PERSON WHO WROTE A REVIEW BELOW, THEY ARE TOTALLY RIGHT. THE OLD INGREDIENTS WERE REAL PRODUCTS THAT HELPED YOU HAIR GREATLY, BUT THE FIRST INGREDIENT NOW IS WATER AND ALCOHOL, HELLOOOOOOOOO, ALCOHOL??? IT WENT FROM CREAM FATTY ACID BASE TO ALCOHOLLLLLLLLL, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANGER, i'M SENDING IT BACK ASAP, AND WILL LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE. IF I WANT ALCOHOL IN MY HAIR I KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT, ARE THESE PEOPLE SERIOUS. THEY'RE USING THE SAME GOOD NAME AND SELLING GARBAGE, WELL GUESS WHAT, I GOT NEWS, MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ACTUALLY READ INGREDIENTS AND THEY WILL FLIP WHEN THEY SEE THIS AN DREFUSE TO BUY IT ANYMORE. GET READY TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR FORMULA BACK. I WOULD GIVE A ZERO STAR IF I COULD."
893,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,4.0,Quick delivery-Product was as described-Great for keeping the ticks off my cats. I have never had any fleas as well.
894,Final Fantasy X,0/0,4.0,"The figure came in a package that had circle tape(I'm under the impression that circle tape is what makes products like these legit). The figure was very satisfactory in paint job but my figure's feet were uneven so he couldn't stand on his own. I have tried to bend them back without trying to break anything but to no avail. Also, I have heard horrendous stories of people trying to put on his replacement arm with disastrous results, like breaking off the initial clothed arm part, so I have not tried doing that. Must have for Auron fans and for the price and time of this review, definitely a steal."
895,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,The water reaches places that floss doesn't always reach. I bought one for each of us.Very pleased with purchase.
896,"Coretex SunX SPF30 Sunscreen Towelettes - 25 Individual Foil Pouch Towelettes/Box, PABA Free, Oil-free, Water and Sweat Resistant, UVA/UVB Protection, Easy Wipe on Application!",0/0,5.0,"Great product - glad we were able to find them. Conveniently packaged, and easy to use. Nice for use for whole family."
897,Bio Kleen Bac Out Enzyme Cleaner,0/0,5.0,Love this! Works great for cloth diapers! The only problem I had was that it leaked a little during shipment! I would definitely buy again!
898,Vitabath Fresh Citrus Twist Moisturizing Bath & Shower Gelee-128 oz.,0/0,5.0,"Spring Green is wonderful on the skin. It leaves the skin smooth and fresh. The smell is incredible while one is showering it scents the whole bathroom with a outdoorsy up in the mountains fresh air smell. I have been buying this product for many, many years and still love it."
899,"PetSafe No-Bark Collar, PBC-102",0/0,2.0,"Have used e-collars with great success for training dogs - please, no whining from the positive reinforcement only camp. My go-to brand is Tri-Tronics products - very sturdy and good service if something breaks, which is rare.Pet-Safe No-Bark Collar worked very well but DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. Don't know if mine was a lemon, or if others have had this problem."
900,"Fluidmaster 8302 Flush Sparkle Bleach Replacement Cartridge, 2 Pack",0/0,4.0,I bought three of the chlorine clean and sparkle units (not be confused with the blue die units). All work well and we are pleased with the cleaning they do. I did need to modify the fill tube attachment on each one. On the 50 year old Eljer toilets there is no center fill tube. The fill tube is molded into the back of the tank. I made a mistake I made years ago. I left the tube full length and it slowly siphoned the water out acting just like a leak. After spending a couple of frustrating days and various replacements for the flush system I realized that there was no leak but rather a siphon. I even remembered that all this happened once before. I cut the tube length so that it was above the water level. Everything has worked fine since. On the one new toilet the fill tube on the Fuidmaster dual flush replacement I installed did not allow for the supplied attachment system to connect to the shouldered tube. It was easy enough to buy a brass tube and solder on a modified brass bar from the discarded flush handle thereby making an idea attachment system. My only concern is that the cast iron hub sewer pipe will eventually be negatively affected by the continual exposure to the strong oxidizing of the chlorine treatment.
901,Eminence Organic Skincare. Stone Crop Hydrating Gel,0/0,2.0,"This product was just ok. When I looked at the bottle and noticed that it didn't have the copyright symbol on it.....It made me wonder whether or not it was the real product or was it a generic? When I used it on my face,it didn't feel any better and didn't see any positive results from it. Next time I will try it out at the spa salon to see if it is any different. Eminence Organic Skin Care - Stone Crop Hydrating Gel 1.2 Oz."
902,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"Great color, although I wish I had known it was matte. But I guess I can always use a shiny top coat. Fast shipping! I would order from this seller again."
903,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Diamond Plate Orbee Ball,1/1,5.0,"My 85 lb Rottie loves this ball. She is a very aggressive chewer, and it's hard to find a soft ball that she doesn't immediately destroy. So far, we've had many happy hours of playing fetch. The ball is hollow with a small opening on the end, and she likes the popping noise it makes when she compresses it together. The only drawback is that it has a smooth finish that gets very wet and slippery after she's had it in her mouth so I usually where gloves. Overall, I am very happy with this product."
904,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The color is fantastic and the compliments have been endless. It matches my green sweater perfectly!
905,"Da Bird Super Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original 36"" Single Pole Cat Toy, Feather Refill, Sparkly Attachment, Kitty Puff Attachment, and Peacock Feather)",1/1,5.0,"My cat is a therapy cat and I am handicapped. I have to be in sitting position most of the time and have tried many toys to keep him entertained but this absolutely blew me away.I have just about ever toy in the house you can think of and he has little or not interest in most of them. I have searched everywhere for something to give him some enthusiasm.Well, Da Bird changed all that. I have never seen him so feral. His eyes get huge and he just goes crazy. Our play session lasts about 20 minutes and it just wears him out. I've never seen him jump so high or be so captivated by anything such as he is this. And it seems to be well constructed. It's holding up well thus far though he is a large guy who tends to break things easily. We still have the original bird attachment in flight now.It's great therapy for both of us. I could not be more pleased with this. This has to be the best cat toy I have ever gotten. I got the super pack too with several attachments and that should keep him very busy for quite some time to come. This is great enrichment for any cat."
906,FootSmart Bunion Regulator,1/1,5.0,"I had some bunion pain and after doing some research, I decided to try a bunion brace. This does the job and my bunion pain is gone. Now my bunion pain was pretty mild, but constant enough to bother me, so someone with more severe pain my not get as good results. But I've had this for a month now and just put it on when I get into be and it is still in good shape. I do walk in it, but I walk on my heels when the braces are on. If you have bunion pain, it's worth a try for the price."
907,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,5.0,"I adopted an Australian shepherd puppy, and bought a crate from the pet store that would be way too small for his adult size (30"" x 18""), so I had to get a bigger crate. I bought this one in the 36"" x 27"" size and it's working out wonderfully! My dog can comfortably sit, stand, lie down, etc. in it, and he's very comfortable. For the price, this crate is very sturdy. The only issue I've had is that the latches on the doors are a bit tough to close. You just have to push down on the doors to make them fit, though, so this isn't a huge problem for us."
908,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I only applied this a couple hours ago and already I'm in love!! This is my first bottle of china glaze and I definitely picked a beautiful color to try. I've heard people say that with china glaze it takes 3 to 4 coats to get true to color, luckily with this color it only took 2.I used a revlon quick dry top coat and so far this is one of the best manicures I've ever had! I've had really bad luck with other polishes so if all china glazes look like this I'm sold!!"
909,"Sherpa 11721 Delta Pet Carrier, Medium, Black",1/1,5.0,"We bought two of these when we moved from the US to Europe. We had our kitties in the cabin with us and they snuggled in and slept most of the flight. When one cat got a little upset, I used the opening on top to comfort her. They look like an ordinary duffle so few people knew we were traveling with cats. There are convenient pockets to store paperwork, etc.Our kitties loved sleeping in these cozy nests for several weeks while they adjusted to a new home."

912,"Pure Turquoise by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Parfum Natural Spray",0/0,5.0,"Pure Turquoise arrived and was just as expected. I'm under the impression it has been discontinued in dept. stores so I ordered it here. Not only was it cheaper but I got a bigger size. Smells great and no difference between my amazon perfume and the ""department store"" perfume."
913,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/1,1.0,I bought this in addition to a littman cardiology III as a backup and all I can say wow what a night and day difference. The littman is much clearer and louder whereas with this particular stethoscope requires excellent hearing IMO to be used. I say why strain to hear something when all you have to do is take the extra few weeks worth of savings and buy a real stethoscope especially for those who considering a profession in the medical field.
914,Dermalogica AGE Smart Power Rich (5 x .3 oz.),0/0,5.0,"I've used this product for years and I'm surprised I don't see it ranked when comparisons are made. Reduces fine lines around my eyes. Amazon is quick, efficient and I love free shipping with prime."

916,Life Time Nutritional Specialties Liquid Calcium Magnesium Citrate Strawberry,1/1,5.0,"The strawberry is the only flavor I've tried so far, but it tastes great, straight out of the bottle. No artificial colors, and no ingredients that seem unnecessary. I have not noticed any issues with diarrhea, as some others have reported with various flavors -- and I'm fairly small in size, and have a sensitive digestive system."
917,Melissa & Doug Plush Stuffed Dolphin,0/0,5.0,This dolphin is just what my grandbaby wanted. Its big enough for her to cuddle with.I would purchase this again !! She loves it.

When one settles down to chew on a dinosaur, I have to find the other one for the other dog or she will look at her sister with envy and try to take the dinosaur away from her. I can give them a dinosaur as a substitute for chewing on the furniture. I will certainly buy this product again."

924,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,0/0,5.0,Its a good product. Use it every day. Keep it charged all the time without a problem. The warrantee is excellent if it breaks during the first year you get a replacement if you call the manufacturer.
925,3M Scotchgard Fabric Protector,0/1,3.0,"I ordered three cans in order to treat cushions we were having re-covered. With seven cats in the house, it's important to be able to easily remove cat hair and an occasional hairball. The instructions on the can strongly suggest doing a colorfast test on a hidden area of the material. Unfortunately, all of our fabric failed the colorfast test so we've not been able to use the product, (although I expect it's fine with compatible material). Just be aware that it can't be used on everything. I've heard it's great on canvas shoes, so I'll be giving that a try."
926,"Johnson & Johnson Flexible Fabric Adhesive Bandages, 1 x 3, 100 per Box",0/0,5.0,These bandages are difficult to find in quantity and outside of select assortments. They stay on for as long as I need (wrapped around a toe) and showering with them causes no problems.

928,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"In my opinion, as others reviews, it didn't look like an actual mint color (not as pictured). It was more white/chalk color, and I didn't like it... because it wasn't what I expected at all."
929,VTech - V.Smile Adapter,0/0,5.0,I bought this mainly for my daughters InnoTab. We were going through batteries at home like crazy. This worked beautifully. And best of all it worked for their vtech laptop too. Multifunctional makes it very well worth the money.
930,"Nature Made SAM-e 400mg Double Strength, 12 Enteric Coated Tablets",1/1,5.0,"This stuff works wonders!I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I lost 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my best friend/roommate to cancer all within 2 years.My doctor placed me on Welbutrin but that stuff made me completely insane! 1 day I was angry, 1 day I was completely miserable, 1 day I was unbearably tired. I also had a horrible headache when I was taking it. I felt like was a mindless zombie on Welbutrin. I decided to stop taking the Welbutrin before it settled into my system.I figured I would try and go the more natural route after reading all the side effects of the other anti-depressant medications they have available. I first triedKira St Johns Wort Tablets - 45 Tablets. These seemed to help, but it was very mild and not consistent in keeping my mood up.Then...there was Nature Made Sam-E. I tried some of the store brand Sam-E's to try and keep costs down, however, none of the other brands even came close to working as good as Nature's Made. And if you shop around you can usually find a buy one get one free at Walgreens, Giant, CVS, or even Amazon!This stuff helped me through the roughest time of my life. I've been using Sam-e well over 2 years now and if I even missed one dose I would immediately notice a huge change in my mood. I have been taking 1 400mg pill a day since I started. Once in a while I would take took 2 or 3 in a day.I just started taking 1 pill every other day to give my body a break because I do not like to be dependent on any type of medication. But for those super hard times, this stuff really helped to get me through.I highly recommend trying Sam-E. Especially before trying any prescription anti-depressants. It is a natural approach to overcoming depression, has low to no side effects at all (I never experienced any), and even if it does not help with improving your mental health, at least it is supporting your joints. ;)Hope this helps!"
931,"JW Pet Company Hol-ee Roller X Extreme 5 Dog Toy, 5-Inches (Colors Vary)",5/5,1.0,"Immediately after giving this ""toy"" to my german shepherd, his lower jaw became ensnared in the lattice opening, resulting in a 10 minute frenzy of his screaming in pain and me trying to loosen the rubber around his jaw enough to release him from it. His canine teeth were inside the ball, and he was frantic! The rubber is so hard I couldn't stretch it over his teeth, and he thrashed and screamed the entire time I tried to remove it. I finally calmed him down enough to stick my finger on his tongue and gently help him back out of it. Unacceptable. Returning it the same day it arrived."
932,Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs and Cats,0/0,5.0,"I tried the Angels' Eyes (sweet potato) WITHOUT the Tylosin and that was useless. Total waste of money!When she (my puppy dog) got her teeth cleaned this past July, the Vet sent her home with antibiotics to take for seven days. Her eye staining totally cleared up so I bought the Angels' Eyes sweet potato flavor WITH the Tylosin. I showed it to my Vet and got her OK before I gave it to my dog.Eye staining is completely gone. She is not crazy about the taste but will eat it. I feed her dry food and sprinkle one half teaspoon of Angels' Eyes on it twice a day.I tasted it and it does have a slightly bitter taste to it. Am going to order the chicken and/or beef flavored to see if there is no bitter taste.My baby is an eight years old Maltese with the sweetest face and with no eye staining the hair at her eyes is clean and the skin at her eyes is no longer irritated.I give Angels' Eyes WITH Tylosin a big thumb's up!!!!!!!"

934,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Chomp & Clack Alligator Push Toy,0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my son when he was about 8 1/2 to 9 months old. It took him a couple of weeks to figure out how to use it, however, once he did then he loves this toy. This walking toy is the perfect height for my son since he is small for his age. The issue we've experienced is that you have to watch your child closely while using this because it will easily tip over, otherwise, he has so much fun."
935,Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller,0/0,5.0,"The product is excellent; light, easy to fold, easy to store, nothing crazy.

940,"Ming Pre-Bonsai Tree Plant - Polyscias - Indoor - 4"" Pot",0/0,4.0,"On Sept. 10, 2012 I did receive my plants in good condition and it was beautiful, but it was not the correct plant. Only the ad is misleading. The name of the plant is correct but the picture is not a Ming Aralia. The Ming Aralia has long feathery, lacey like leaves. Out of the 4 small pictures that are posted below it, the first picture and also the large picture they advertise with are Parsley Aralia's the 3 smaller pictures are the Ming Aralia. Also the plants I received had a plant tag that also said it was a Parsley Aralia. But they are two total different looking plants. I contacted Hirts by phone the day I received them to tell them I got a Parsley Aralia and not a Ming Aralia they asked me to email pictures and to give them the order number and info I also included a copy of the packing slip that came with them and have yet to get an answer or even know if I will get the correct plant. I got this for my son, for his birthday so I don't know what I am going to do because it is not the Ming Aralia he wanted it is a Parsley Aralia.Heard from seller and they are resending my plants, can't wait to get them."
941,"Wheat Thins, Sundried Tomato & Basil, 9.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,3.0,"These are wheat thins, with some flavor added. The Flavor is very salty, and you can definitely taste the MSG that they added as a cheap way to spike the flavor. As far as i remember, you can't really taste the basil at all."

Even after the first night, I could see a change for the better, and after two weeks, I would say it is a miracle-worker!Super-satisfied, will for sure buy again!"
944,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",0/0,5.0,"we have an 11month old choc lab.... enough said? I ordered this particular collar because it did not specify for large or small breeds. He is still learning what to bark at and what not to bark at. This helps out immediately. He will jump up for NO apparent reason and just bark. (maybe the cat walked past him, or maybe someone in another room got out of a chair) Putting the collar on him did not bother him at all. Everything was normal (to him) until he just decided (of course, again)to bark for no apparent reason. He stopped immediately. Walked around like ""what the heck"" then tried to bark again. He stopped immediately again. This time we said ""no Bark!"" to help associate that phrase w/ being quiet. He has been quiet ever since. It has worked. ---I do not leave it on overnight. just when we are home and know that there is no reason to bark..(now if they made one that helps ""stop being a total crazy, crazy run around the room at night"" collar) ;)"
945,"Sweet Sweat Skin Cream, 13.5 Ounce Jar",1/1,3.0,"I'm into my second week of this product and even though I am sweating a little more on the areas I put the goop onto, it's just not making me drenched with sweat during my workout. I do like the smell and it does make my skin extremely soft and moisturized. I hope to give it a few more weeks of use and then perhaps write a followup review. So far it's JUST OK for me. I think I need to try different areas of application to see what the effects are."

947,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,0/0,5.0,"This is super easy to use, durable, comes with a great booklet all about Painted Lady Butterflies, you can easily hang it... it's just very awesome. I really can't imagine anything you can buy your child that would be more memorable. We received our butterflies fairly quickly. They were tiny caterpillars at first, they quickly grew, and then formed cocoons. We ended up with 8 butterflies. The whole experience was simply amazing! I can't recommend it highly enough."

With constant migrane headaches and neck pain I have found this Firm 4 inch collar to give me much needed support and relief of pressure exerted from head movement. I will be purchasing more of these collars in the near future. The 3"" and 3.5"" collars did not provide enough support in the area I needed it most. Some of the other collars I have tried were way too soft and did not give the ridged support that I need. Thank YOU for building this product it helps me Allot!"
949,Jacquard Funky-groovy Tie Dye Kit,0/0,4.0,"Some friends and I wanted to do a tie dye project for upcoming mud run team t-shirts. We wanted vibrant colors. The fact that this kit comes with a package of soda ash to fix the dye is really important. Unlike some other kits I've seen, the soda ash will ensure bright colors that don't fade to pastel with one wash! Super easy to understand instructions. My only complaint...in my opinion the box saying the kit will dye up 5 t-shirts is a stretch. No way it will do 5 adult t-shirts anyway. Maybe 5 small kid sized."
950,PRELIEF TABS DIETARY SUPPL Size,1/1,5.0,I take it after every meal and it does the trick! I have gastritis which also leads to having acid in my bladder. This stops it and I have felt the results! I recommend it to anyone with that same problem. Only thing is that if you eat often (like small meals every three hours) it might cause constipation. Aside from that it will works wonders!
951,"Breathe Right Nasal Strips, Large, 30-Count Boxes",0/0,5.0,"This product has been a lifesaver. Have no other words for it. Yes, I now use it along with a medically presribed nasal spray but when I first tried the nasal spray it did't work at all. I tried the breathe right strips and it didn't work at all. I put on the breathe right strip one night and without thinking about it gave myself a half-hearted shot of the nasal spray in each nostril and suddenly realized I was breathing clearly and easily. Since that night I have used the two in conjunction with each other and have no problems. My allergies don't interfere with my sleeping, my breathing doesn't interfere and I feel just fine. Not happy with the result from your own trial usage? Try it this way. I recommend it highly. It will change the way you sleep."
952,Deluxe Wheel of Fortune,0/0,1.0,I purchased this game one month ago. The spinner marker broke on the first use. I have tried repeatedly to contact Pressman customer service to get new part. They have promised 3 times to replace part but none has arrived. Poorly constructed and no help from company.
953,"Environmental Air Sponge, 8-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I read somewhere that there is something about the oil on a dog's skin underneath his coat that causes him to smell so raunchy after being outside in the heat. Whatever the reason, I put a couple of these odor absorbers in the room where my dog's cage stays, and I could tell a noticible difference the same day. There is no way to get rid of all the doggie odors, but I definitely feel I got my money's worth with these unobtrusive little containers of odor absorber. As helpful as they've been with these doggie odors, I will probably buy more to use in closets and bathrooms...maybe even my car."
954,Met-Rx Big 100 Meal Replacement Bars 12 ea,0/0,2.0,"They don't taste too bad because they have loads of sugar but you will never mistaken these for candy bars. They still have that weird protein shake taste and I could only taste a hint of cookie dough flavor. Also the bar is very chewy so it will take you some time to consume the whole thing.I suppose in an emergency situation you could get away with these but I find it easier just to eat real food. I would find a can of tuna, water, and a piece of fruit more enjoyable than chewing away at this and other meal replacement bars. This particular bar is a meal replacement bar and not just a protein bar but I think there are so many other ways to put together a 400 calorie meal that tastes much better than this product.At least this bar has real sugar. Some bars that advertise only 2 or 3 grams of sugar are loaded with sugar alcohols or some other chemicals that are not good for you. Then again, I don't know how 25 grams of sugar is supposed to help you reach any weight-loss or nutrition goals.The pictures on all of these meal replacement products look appetizing but in reality the product itself is anything but.My advice is to find a way to just get your protein from real food. It's healthier, cheaper, and it tastes better."
955,"BSN Noxplode 2.0, 2.48 Pounds",0/0,5.0,This isn't my first time drinking this. My brother had it a while ago and I used it and feel the energy just ready to release.I bought this because I am on a diet again. I do notice a difference when I do not take it.

956,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Expose Your Toes,0/0,5.0,Sand of a Beach is a shimmery neutral that I love to use. I was lucky to find it from an Amazon provider. It is the perfect color for almost any time of year and for any occasion. It arrived carefully packaged and a couple of days earlier than promised! I would not hesitate to purchase from this provider again.
957,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,4.0,"My daughter is 6 months, and jumping all the time in my arms. When we tried out a friends jumper, we knew that she needed one of her own because she loved it so much. This activity center isn't the most engaging, but she seems to love it so far. The best part is that she gets to jump over and over and over again! She's a bit afraid of the music, so we leave that part turned off. The only negative is that it's such a large toy for our small apartment, and we only have enough space for it in our living room so we have to break it down if we want to watch TV."
958,Make Up For Ever Aqua Eyes,0/0,2.0,"I was disappointed with this eyeliner. It does not go on smoothly or evenly. After several attempts, I gave up using it and went back to my old eyeliner."

961,D-Mannose,1/1,5.0,"I am only 22 years old and my marriage was failing because of recurrent UTIs. Let's just say... every time...I would get one. They would last for anywhere between 3 days and 10 days.I took over-the-counter pills (AZO, Cystex) and all they did was provide temporary relief. Eventually they stopped being effective altogether since I had to use them about 2 weeks in a row at a time.I got a prescription for Macrobid, an antibiotic. It did work after about a day in clearing up a UTI, but did not prevent them. Plus who would want to be on antibiotics their entire romantic lifetime? Not healthy at all. Expensive too.I ordered this after finding a forum post about it. I didn't believe it would work, I really didn't.... IT DOES. IT WORKS. My marriage is currently long-distance while my husband's immigration from USA to Canada is processing, so I had about a week to start taking one heaping tablespoon a day in a bottle of water. Usually I took it at night, not in the morning (so I'd never forget to if I was in a hurry one morning). My husband arrived to visit me... NO UTIs. NONE.There was one day I did not get to take the powder, and I felt a tiny, tiny little tinge of one coming on (so I took a Macrobid pill as a precaution, even though I probably didn't need to). But the next day I took the powder and never felt discomfort again. So for me, it's 100% proven. THIS WORKS. If you take it daily, you will not have UTIs again.I would also avoid alcohol/fizzy drinks to be honest, anything rough on the bladder. I DID however drink lots of coffee and it didn't affect the powder's usefulness. Still worked!!!I will take this powder every single day for the rest of my life now!!! COMPLETELY WORTH THE MONEY!I am totally appalled that doctors refuse to suggest this little miracle. I'm very young, and it SAVED MY LIFE. I CANNOT THANK ANY MAKERS OF THIS PRODUCT ENOUGH!"
962,Chinese Fortune Sticks,0/0,5.0,"This was a set purchased for my mother who loves things like this.She loves them and seeks her ""fortune"" every day,"
963,Fisher-Price Smart Cycle,1/1,4.0,"We've had this for a little over a year now (my son received this as a gift shortly before his 4th birthday), and my son still uses it.Pros:It's held up to the abuse of a 3-5 year old boy who is very energetic and active. He carries it from one place to another, climbs all over it, etc.Batteries seem to last a long time. It runs on D batteries, rather than AC. I have rechargeable D batteries, and I've only had to recharge them a few times. He doesn't play with it every day, but he does play with it a few times a week, sometimes for an hour or two at a time. Alternatively, you can get AA to D battery adapters (I have ones from Focalprice - super cheap, but work marvelously. They convert 2 AA batteries to a D - search ""2AA to D Battery Adapter Converts 2 pieces of AA battery to D battery"" on focalprice dot com). 2 AA batteries are equivalent to 1/2 D, so the batteries will run out faster, but rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and easy to get a hold of, unlike rechargeable D batteries, which are expensive.My son enjoys playing it. It's easy for him to use the controls and do what he wants to do. As he happens to like the ""racing"" games best, he ends up pedaling a lot, though the pedals have very little resistance, and the resistance is not adjustable, so I'm not sure how much exercise he's really getting even when he's pedaling a lot.The seat is adjustable, so it works for kids of various sizes.The games aren't particularly obnoxious.It comes with a very long cord to connect to the TV.It's very easy to set up and use - nothing complicated about it.The cons:It runs on D batteries with no AC option. Yes, if you know what you are doing, you can wire it to run on AC, but most people don't know how to do that. I get that it's nice to not have that extra cord, but you already have a really long cord going to the TV anyway, so why not have the option to run on batteries or AC?The games are pretty much all the same with different characters. We have the game that comes with it, Scooby Doo, Superfriends, and Cars. They look different, but they're all the same game.I don't know how it is with the newer version of this bike, but the games we have with our bike all have graphics that look straight out of the 80s. Cartridges are probably going to hold up better than whatever alternative there could be while still allowing for small kids to handle the media, but would it have really added much to the price of the bike or the cartridges to have the graphics meet Nintendo 64 levels? The bike is already the price of a cheap console, and the games are ridiculously expensive, so I assume the margins are pretty sweet for Fisher Price.There's no memory or saving of anything. You can't take a screen shot and send it anywhere. My son doesn't seem to care or notice, but it would be nice if there was some way to save preferences or save files to a memory card.Overall, none of the cons outweigh the simple fact that my son enjoys this toy, and it has some educational value, and it's not obnoxious."
964,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,5.0,"This is absolutely a beautiful color. I wear this often, and it may be my all time favorite China Glaze color. I get compliments from strangers in a store on this color because it changes colors depending on the lighting. The color is great on long or short nails, and does not show wear. Try it you will fall in love with it."
965,"Energizer A23 Battery, 12 Volt - 2 Pack",0/0,5.0,The product is much cheaper than those found in drug store. It has excellent quality. The product I got is exactly as described. Highly recommended.
966,Music Maker Lap Harp (Zither) with 12 Classic Songs PLUS Bonus Packet of 12 Christmas Songs (six double sided sheets),0/0,5.0,I used to play the piano but sold it years ago. My friend showed me her zither harp and let me play it. It was love at first sight. I play the zither harp during comercials at night when I am watching tv. The zither harp is so soothing . I found more music for the zither harp on line at Amazon.com. The zither harp is an easy to play instrument. The zither harp produces soothing musical sounds.I recommend it to any one that enjoys simple instruments.
967,Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil Concentrate with Omega-3 Fatty Acids - 400 Softgels,1/2,4.0,I take three a day (based on what I read).Yes they smell terrible. Yes they give you stinky burps.I can deal with 2-3 burps after every pill so I'm ok with it.Great deal though. Lots of pills for low cost.
968,Walking with Prehistoric Beasts,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old has watched this over again, so many times, he loves it. The information is accurate, and he has learned every name and era."
969,Super Pet My First Home for Rabbits,1/1,5.0,"The cage was just as discriped, it arrived quickly and was easy to setup. My hedgehog lives it almost as much as treats!"
970,Romance,0/0,5.0,"I smelled Ralph Lauren in a store and i saw the price and i was like ill go to amazon i can get it cheaper there so i bought it here and after purchasing it i read the reviews and was scared because people said this isn't it. well, i beg to differ. It smells like it and i am VERY satisfied. i get compliments almost everyday."
971,DURACELL D361/362B Watch/Calculator Battery,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful! item came WAY B4 expected. 29 year old watch needed battery 4 ~20 yrs, popped it in and WORKS PERFECTLY. Nicely done BIC Warehouse!"
972,Enzymatic Therapy L-Theanine,1/1,4.0,Not as well as a prescript but it's safer too. It's the same ingredient in green tea without the caffiene.
973,Lupine Designer Roman Dog Harness,0/0,5.0,I ordered this for my Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. She is about 65 lbs. My original intention was to use this when I take her kayaking. I figure it will be easier to help her back into the boat. I haven't used it kayaking yet but I tried it out for walking and I really like it. She wasn't a big puller when walking but now she pulls even less.
974,Maxim Alphabet Blocks (26 pcs),3/3,4.0,"I have to admit that I was expecting larger blocks. These are tiny, but would be great to use for decoration. My son is a little too young to play with these as I think they could be a potential choking hazard."
975,Petmate Fat Cat Classic Crackler - Turtle,0/0,5.0,Both of our cats love playing with these toys. They are colorful and make great noises. They don't seem to get tired of playing with them either.
976,Matrix Color Smart Reflective Shine Spray 4.2 oz.,0/0,5.0,Love this spray! Makes my blonde hair look really shiny and healthy. It is a standard in my hair care routine. A little spray goes a long way to add beautiful reflective shine.
977,Twinlab Super Enzyme,26/26,5.0,"I have used this product for many years, taking 1 capsule with each meal or snack. Many companies make this type of supplement. I prefer Twinlab because they have a good reputation and because their product covers all the bases for boosting digestion. This supplement includes both hydrochloric acid, which tends to decrease in the body as we age, and digestive enzymes, which are normally produced by a healthy pancreas. These Super Enzyme Caps contain the Big Three of digestive enzymes"
978,"Torani Sugar Free English Toffee Syrup w/ Splenda, 750 mL",0/0,5.0,"I love thesesyrups for a low sugar iced coffee in the summer and coming into the fall, lattes! Combined with fat free half and half, I never feel guilty about enjoying them. This flavor is very good, without the bitterness I have tasted in some."
979,"Van Ness CP6 Enclosed Cat Pan/Litter Box, Large",0/0,5.0,"Should have looked closer at the measurements because it was a little smaller than i was expecting, but shipped fast, was in good condition and all parts were there!"
980,DaVinci Emily 4 in 1 Crib including Toddler Rail,1/1,5.0,"My husband and I received our new grandson's crib yesterday evening. It took us one and one half hours to completely assembly this very nice bed. As we are both near 70 years old, we thought that was pretty good. All the bolts, nuts and washers were included. The crib is a rich cherry color and very sturdy."
981,Wet-Stop Full Waterproof Mattress Cover,2/2,5.0,"This product does exactly what it is intended to do. I bought if for a family member who is disabled & has occasional bed wetting accidents. It has a waterproof barrier/lining inside with a very soft & comfortable topside. The sides are stretchy, enabling it to fit a wide range of mattress thickness/sizes. I bought the full size & it fit perfectly, even over a memory foam mattress. It is very durable & stands up to washing very well. This is a perfect product to protect mattresses from accidents or spills of any kind. It's absorbent & keeps fluids away from the bedding by protecting with its waterproof inner lining. Seems to be very well manufactured. Worth the money & directing others to this product."
982,CytoSport Cytomax Sport Energy Drink,0/1,2.0,"I was hoping it would not taste as bad as other reviewers descriptions when I purchased it.However, other reviews are right.Cytomax changes the tangy orange formula; it doesn't taste good anymore"
983,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 50-piece Wooden ABC/123 Blocks Set,0/0,4.0,Blocks are great but I wish they were larger than 1x1x1 inch. I like that they came with a bag to keep them in.
984,"Tootsie Pops-Variety Pack, 100 Pops",0/0,5.0,"I love TRP's but buying a hundred is not the brightest idea for me. I'm a sugar addict. I dunno, maybe a hundred more wouldn't hurt."
985,FOREVER AFTER ALL DAY MOISTURIZER 22 FL OZ AUSTRALIAN GOLD,0/0,4.0,"I like this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and soaks in. I like the consistency of it. It is thick but not heavy like a cream. It is not greasy and soaks in. It smells like Bath and Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar. Not my favorite smell but wearable, and the smell fades pretty fast. Don't know how well it will prolong my tan yet. But for the $ you get a large bottle and if it works to keep the tan it's worth it. Don't buy products at the salon they are so expensive. Amazon is a much better deal."
986,Disney Princess Variety Collection By Disney For Women. Set-4 Piece Mini Variety With Snow White & Cinderella & Beauty And The Beast & Sleeping Beauty,0/0,1.0,One of the glass was empty. Maybe the Cinderela's glass.I had to send a gift and no have time to replace.
987,Lupine Designer Roman Dog Harness,0/0,5.0,I ordered this for my Rhodesian Ridgeback mix. She is about 65 lbs. My original intention was to use this when I take her kayaking. I figure it will be easier to help her back into the boat. I haven't used it kayaking yet but I tried it out for walking and I really like it. She wasn't a big puller when walking but now she pulls even less.
988,WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser,1/1,5.0,This product is the second one I have purchased. The first one was an earlier model I got from my dentist and I literally wore it out from use. It lasted about six years. This is the only model that has a large enough water reservoir to get the job done without having to refill it.
989,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",0/5,1.0,"Not the right type for power points in australia, not going to bother to send it back as it I didn't spend too much on it anyway."
990,Gaia Herbs Hawthorn Supreme,0/0,5.0,"I HAVE BEEN TAKING HAWTHOWRN SUPREME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. IT HELPS MY TACCHYCARDIA (RAPID HEART BEAT). UNLIKE SOME MEDICATIONS, IT HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON MY HEART - IT IMPROVES ITS STRENGTH. I PLAN TO TAKE IT THE REST OF MY LIFE. I AM 81 YEARS OLD. PRESENTLY, I PURCHASE MY SUPPLY FROM AMAZON BECAUSE IT HAS THE BEST PRICE."
991,Evangelion Eva Revoltech Unit 00 Action Figure Yellow Edition,0/0,5.0,"A quality figure. The design is accurate and well done, and you can tell it's quality. The joints can be stiff when you move it, but that's because the joints hold fast to keep poses. My only problem was that the hands are fairly difficult to swap out. But considering it's a figure, I won't be changing it THAT much, so it's all good."
992,CarpalMate Professional Carpal Wrist Support,0/0,5.0,"For the longest time every time I used my desktop (i have small computer space so my wrists ending up bending on the edge) or using my MacBook pro my wrists would hurt and it would be very distracting. While Carpal Mate isn't quite as effective and you may feel slightly more discomfort than with the more popular full size braces, it provides more range of motion and is a lot easily to get in and out of. These are also much much better for gaming."
993,TeleBrands Deluxe Doggy Steps,0/0,3.0,"I had one of these steps when they first came out on TV. My doxies loved it. However, the cover was getting worn and I could not find just the covers. Therefore, I purchased the whole set - steps & cover. Well, the steps are terrible! Difficult to put together and then did not stay together. I ended up using the new cover on my old steps. They are much better!!"
994,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Battery Powered Sir Topham Hatt Figure 8 Set,0/0,3.0,Missing battery-powered car. I advised company of this and received no response. Love this set but really wanted the car promised.
995,Mysore Sandalwood Soap 150g Double Size (Pack of 3),0/0,5.0,"Years ago, I used to buy Mysore Sandalwood soup. I had forgotten how it scented all my little apartment with a clean but not perfumy scent. Recently I rediscovered the soap again at Amazon. Most soap is made of lard and lye - ugh! This one is made with sandalwood oil only, and Ayurveda medicine recommends it for your skin. The scent of it clears your mood and makes for a healthy feeling. Good for body and soul!"
996,"Wild Republic Cat Floppy Orange Tabby 7""",1/1,4.0,"This was our 2nd purchase of this product. My daughter got this as a gift when she was about 8 mths old. She loved him since day 1 and called him "" bop"" because that's all she could say at the time. He's withstood many hugs, pulls and washes. He goes everywhere she goes! "" Bop"" started getting a tiny hole by his nose just beacuse my now 2 yr old daughter started chewing on his nose. Sadly it was time for bops retirement and no. 2 had to step in. So, in our book, we love this product!"
997,"JW Pet Company Clean Cup Feeder and Water Cup Bird Accessory, Medium, Colors may vary",1/1,4.0,"I use this water cup for my society and zebra finches who are messy, messy, messy birds. I had been using an open bowl, which they enjoyed, but in addition to using it for their water intake, they also bathed in it and pooped frequently in it. It was disgusting. I finally bought this water cup, which is blessedly poo-free. At first, it was a little stiff to remove. You have to give it a little twist to unlock it and it tried to fight me the first few days. Now, it slides easily for removal and I am quite content with it."
998,Bioxy Cleanse (180 Capsules),0/0,1.0,"This didn't do anything. I was expecting something, anything, but this did nothing at all. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
999,Nature's Way Glucomannan Caps,0/0,2.0,I really didn't think this was any more effective than drinking a big glass of water. I was hoping to feel more satisfied with less food. Not so much.
1000,Diaper Dude Diaper Bag,0/1,2.0,Quality of materials is sub par. It looks very cheap in person - kind of like freebie ($15 max value). Zippers are hard to move. Didn't feel durable at all -> returned it.
1001,Creed Fleurissimo for Women 0.05 oz Millesime Sampler Vial,1/1,1.0,"Fleurissimo By Creed For Women. Millesime Spray 2.5 Oz.This is my favourite daytime perfume, I won't wear anything else, so you can imagine that my nose is quite honed to it's smell. My usual site that I buy from was out of stock & because I had run out I couldn't wait & ordered from 99perfume through Amazon.When it arrived it was well packed & the packaging, bottle looked right. However when I sprayed it, it smelled stale & musty...unbearable. It also looked a very deep yellow...which I though wasn't right either.It cost me 111.00.I ended up having to go into my local town centre & purchasing another bottle from John Lewis at the princely sum of 153.00...and good enough when I compared it to the other one, the one from John Lewis was a lovely pale straw colour.I had to rate this product otherwise my review wouldn't have gone through but believe me,it doesn't deserve even one star. Buyer beware & buy from a trusted source."
1002,Spornette Mini Deville Round #352,0/1,5.0,This tiny brush is perfect because i have really thin hair and it is so tiny it fits in little bags.
1003,Happi Tummi Natural Colic Relief Waistband,0/0,5.0,"I'm using it almost every night. My LO has painful gasses every night, I wrap it around her waist before she goes to bed and insert warm pouch when she is in pain. Helps her relax and fall back asleep."
1004,"Dawn Wash & Toss Disposable Dish Pads, Case Pack, Eight - 20 count Containers (160 Pads)",0/0,5.0,As a camper I love these wash and toss clothes. I wish I could find them again. I don't have to fill a sink with water to wash a few dishes. They sure do come in handy for a quick job of doing the dishes so you can enjoy the outdoors.
1005,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,0/0,5.0,This is a great product. Usually drying my hair takes me forever but with this dryer it takes 5 minutes.
1006,Skunk-Off Shampoo - 8 oz,0/0,5.0,"If you can only afford one, I would buy the Shampoo. Of course my dog is not dry yet but I can put my nose into her coat and smell nothing. I used the spray as soon as she was sprayed but because the bulk of the smell/oil was around her eyes I was not able to spray the area. I let the spray dry and then threw her into the shower and started to wash her. I had to wash the affected area about 4 times to get all of the smell out but it is well worth it. Warning, one 8 oz bottle will wash a Golden Retriever until all of the smell is gone, once. You might want to buy multiple or the gallon jug to make sure that you have enough incase you could not get the affected area as well as you wanted. I just bought 2 gallons since I have 2 dogs and this is the 2nd skunk encounter in 8 days, lucky me. I wish that I had this product when my other dog was sprayed last week, though he is the reason why I bought it. Good Luck to all of you who have the wonderful luck of being sprayed. :)"
1007,Marina Multi-Vac Battery Powered Vacuum,0/0,1.0,"simply put this product does not work, the power out of the battery is insufficient to suck in almost anything. I tried it on plant trimmings, no luck. Then I tried it on gravel it only caused a mess without sucking in anything."
1008,Fekkai Advanced Full Blown Volume Shampoo,1/1,3.0,"It gives volume, but my hair feels almost coated after using it for a while. It almost feels dirty. Maybe if you alternate it with a different shampoo it would be ok, but after using it for a couple months I quit."
1009,XyliChew Raspberry Mints,1/1,5.0,"Xylitol is fantastic for dental health.These mints are great because they don't contain any of the less-than-ideal additives (like aspartame-nutrasweet, saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.) that make most other gums and mints, even those with xylitol as an ingredient, problematic.The flavor is nice, the texture is fine, the appearance is normal (just a cute little white tablet).Note that these mints are manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.I wish that these mints could be purchased in smaller amounts, because the price for the 2-pack of these giant containers is quite a lot of money to spend on something you've never tried before. I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in a 30-mint, portable little cardboard box or something, and sold it as an ""add-on"" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try them out."
1010,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,1/1,5.0,"I'm not normally the type of person to do a review, but I feel obligated to write one for this product. The gentle leader is a miracle worker. I have a sixty pound hyperactive Labrador Retriever (more than half my weight), and no matter how successful she is with training in the back yard, she would go nuts whenever we got into unfamiliar territory. I tried everything with her--clicker training, positive reinforcement, treats, a check cord, stopping when she would pull beyond the length of the leash, etc. Things would go great in the back yard, but once we got into the real world, it was a whole different story. With new sights, sounds, people, and dogs, Ella would lose all self control. It often led to me holding onto the leash with all my strength walking awkwardly behind my overly-excited dog.Finally at my wit's end, I caved in and decided to purchase the prong collar from a local pet store. When I spoke with the associate, he asked me why I had chosen to utilize the prong collar. I explained my efforts to him, and he redirected me to the Gentle Leader. He explained the differences between the two to me. While there is debate amongst pet owners on whether or not the prong collar is humane, this review is not intended to address that issue. The Gentle Leader is much like the headstall and reins for a horse. If you have control of the head, you will have control of the whole body. The body goes where the nose goes. Holding the two up next to each other, the Gentle Leader looks much less menacing than the prong collar. The associate urged me to purchase the Gentle Leader, and if it did not work, then I could try the prong collar.I went home, and I was excited to fit the new gadget to my dog. Word of advice--watch the DVD included with the kit prior to fitting it to your dog. It clarifies a lot of uncertainty in fitting the Gentle Leader. I tried to follow the instructions provided on the paper, and though I was successful, it would have been much less confusing if I had watched the DVD first. I initially had some trouble with the nose loop. I could not figure out how the collar and nose loop worked until I realized that the nose loop had to be pulled up through the double-D ring. It seems like when the collar is fitted properly, the dog has the possibility of choking because it is supposed to be such a tight fit to avoid chafing. However, the DVD explains why the dog will be fine with such a tightly fitted collar.I fitted Ella with both pieces, and there was initial hesitation on her part. We started our walk, and there was quite a bit of pawing at her face for the first five minutes. There were a couple of pulls ahead of me, but she quickly learned that she was not comfortable with her head being redirected when she lunged forward. After adapting to the feeling of the Gentle Leader, Ella became a completely different dog. She was being incredibly well-behaved walking at my side. She didn't pull once after the first five minutes, and we enjoyed a two-hour walk together.In short, the Gentle Leader is a miracle-worker for anyone with a dog who chooses to walk them rather than being walked. I was astonished at how easy it was to walk her, and I am looking forward to exploring new places with her. I used to be embarrassed that she would drag me along as she sought out different stimuli. Now, she is easy to walk with, and I enjoy my time with her. Walking Ella is no longer a chore for me. She gets the exercise she needs, and I get to keep my arm. The Gentle Leader is by far one of the best purchases I have made for my dog."
1011,"Toppik Hair Building Fibers, The 30 Second ""HAIR TRANSPLANT"" Economy Size 25 grams",1/1,5.0,"I have my hairdresser apply this when I get a blow-dry and it lasts a week! It keeps my hair looking fuller and fills in the thinning spots. The applicator, however, sometimes clogs or the fibers hit in the wrong place, but it's correctible. Overall, it's the best product I've found!"
1012,"Speed Stick Deodorant, 3 Ounce (Case of 6)",0/1,5.0,"My fianc&eacute; loves this brand. He has been a loyal fan for over 25 years. However, he is sensitive to this particular deodorant. I will be returning them and purchasing a non scented one."
1013,Paasche Airbrush Quick Disconnect,0/0,3.0,"It doesn't leak and works as a quick disconnect, but it does restrict air flow. It is tricky to make a good connection."
1014,"Coccyx Cushion - Extra Soft - 16"" x 18"" x 3"" to 1""",2/2,3.0,"To be honest, this product did no miracles for me. My tailbone still hurts but maybe a little less than before. This is the only cushion I tried so not sure if there is another product out there that works better. I have a 9 to 5 deskjob & I needed this around 6th month of my pregnancy. End of the day my tailbone still hurts but it does provide some cushioning which does help."
1015,Elasto-Gel Cranial Cap - Sizes S/M and L/XL,0/0,4.0,This item chills all the parts of my head where I need it when I get a migraine or a tension headache. I just wish it would stay cold longer. It seems like it warms up pretty fast. But it definitely helps.
1016,New Life Spectrum Cichlid Formula - 300 g,0/0,4.0,"My mixed mbuna gobble this stuff up. I also feed OSI's spirulina flake. Nice to have the mix of flake and pellet in the feeding frenzy, as well as some variety for the fish diet, but they seem to go after this food with a little more vigor. Plenty of food, lasts a long time. Pellet size was a little smaller than I expected; might go with the larger size next time. Fish eat it quickly, but I feel like it would be easier deliver more food more quickly without it reaching bottom with a larger pellet size. Still, this works fine, particularly for mbuna that haven't reached full size."
1017,"Ozium Glycol-Ized Professional Air Sanitizer / Freshener Original Scent, 0.8 oz. aerosol (OZ-1)",0/0,5.0,"This stuff is great! I bought a three year-old used car that only had one previous owner, and that owner was a smoker. The dealership tried to cover up the smell by spraying the car with that awful not-quite-new-car perfume which only made it worse. It had also picked up a slightly mildewy smell after a few days of being parked outside in the hot, humid Ohio air.I purchased a little canister of the original scent Ozium at Meijer (it's cheaper there, btw) just out of curiosity after reading the good reviews on Amazon. When I got home, I sprayed it a good deal more than the recommended 1-2 seconds (sprayed the back seat, trunk, front seats and foot wells, fabric lining the doors, the ceiling liner, etc) which was probably wasteful. I cracked the windows and left it alone overnight. At first, the car smelled almost overwhelmingly like Lemonheads candy. In the morning, there were no smells at all, Ozium or otherwise. The smoke and mildew smells are gone rather than covered up - there's none of that awful ""kind of smoky, kind of lemony, generally still gross"" odor. The fabric is dry to the touch and doesn't have the sticky residue other spray-on fabric deodorizing products tend to leave behind."
1018,Cadbury Curly Wurly Bar from England (Pack 6 Bars),0/0,5.0,"As so many have said here- hands down, I agree. Yes, these Cadbury Curly Wurly bars are reminiscent of the Marathon Bars which were sold here, in the US, at least over 30yrs ago (Wow. What a downer to be reminded I am that old! SMILE)! Very similarly great tasting! But, of course- with all due respect to Cadbury (the makers of the Curly Wurly bar) the Curly Wurly did come first but it IS a Marathon reminder! And, of course- that's coincidental since the Curly Wurly was a predecessor! (and, I can only guess that Cadbury is PRAYING that we stop with the Marathon thing- I know they are thinking, ""Marathon WHO?? WE CAME FIRST!"".However, yes, Curly Wurly's inevitably IS a pleasantly missed reminder of that old missed Marathon Bar! Which, by the way- should be good for Curly Wurly sales here in the US. That's how I found the candy bar on here (someone told me to find it-'cause it tasted close to the Marathon bar)!But, alas, take heed"
1019,Quantum Research Buzz Away Outdoor Spray,1/1,4.0,"I am the Ultimate Mosquito Magnet. I always say that if we were to put a hungry mosquito in a room of 1000 people, it would go straight for me. no doubt about that.the smell of Buzz Away is quite strong yet citrus-y and natural so it's no unpleasant, though whether this product this product is effective for a mosquito magnet like myself, the answer is YES and NO.Scenario 1 - YESthis handy mosquito spray is small enough to carry around with me in my purse [especially in the summer time], and it works wonderful if i'm dining outdoors with friends, gardening, or when a pesky mosquito has found its way inside the house.as long as i re-apply about every 2-3 hours, i am protected - which i believe is normal for a NATURAL product, and a small price to pay. [if you can't deal with re-applying often you might want to go the DEET route]Scenario 2 - NOi brought this spray with me camping on a florida beach, and it did NOT protect me at night. obviously i was sleeping so i couldn't re-apply the product and would wake up in the morning with bites all over, even though i had profusely sprayed myself before bed.i ended up having to switch to a DEET product at night - which is unfortunate because i'd have much preferred sleeping with a clean citrus smell in the air rather than a harmful toxic stench. but i had no choice if i wanted to avoid getting bit at night.CONCLUSION:Buzz Away works best when used for short-term exposures to mosquitos [outdoor walks, dinners, gardening..] and if re-applied every few hours for longer exposures.I would not recommend Buzz Away for night-time protection, unless you plan on waking up throughout the night to spray yourself.Hope this helps!"
1020,Sinus Buster Classic Formula by Sinus Buster - .68 Ounces,1/2,4.0,"I just got this product--my ENT told me about it on the sly. I had auffered loss of smell in my right side after a hideous sinus infection in July. I went to two ENTs, an allergist, did acupuncture. Nothing. I just tried this stuff (one spray at a time, as the scaredy cats on this site made me nervous about it), and for this first time in weeks I could smell a bit! About 15%, but still, it was almost an immediate result. So i went ahead and did the second spray.It burns ever so slightly and lasts for about 5 seconds. Do not listen to these complainers; it's even kind of refreshing. I am recommending this product to everyone I know with chronic sinus problems as well as to those with migraines (that includes me, too).I do not give this product 5 stars only because it is so new to me. But I had to come on and post as soon as I got the result that I did."
1021,Midwest Gold- Zinc Indoor/Outdoor Exercise Pet Pen,0/0,3.0,"This product is not as heavy duty as the last two I ordered. It does serve the purpose of extending my pets outdoor play area when connected to the other two, however the material is not the same heavy duty weight as previously ordered."
1022,Merry Pet Products-Cat Washroom And Night Stand,4/4,3.0,"This was actually really idiot proof to put together. The real problem we have run into is that none of our three cat litter pans fit inside, nor did the one we purchased. Also, because of the door, you have to make sure that your pan, especially a lidded one has a shallow enough lower pan for the cat to be able to get inside the cat washroom door and the door of the covered pan. This may not even be doable. We're heading out to the pet supply store armed with measuring tape to figure out what we can get that will work. If you're wondering whether your cat pan will fit, here are the dimensions of a pan that would fit.To fit the pan can be no more than...HEIGHT"
1023,Kikkerland Crazy Invisible Playing Cards,0/4,5.0,"great product, fun for my kids..My son collects playing cards, so this adds to his collection..I think it's annoying to have t write a long review when a couple of simple words can make what i felt about the product short and simple! Makes me not want to write reviews"
1024,"MANISCHEWITZ Mandlen For Soup, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,3.0,"Ok, I like to try new things and this was new for me. I was hoping to use them to float on top of soup to give it texture and a little additional flavor. Well, neither happened. So puffy that they melted in the soup almost immediately and created a gummy texture. It may be exactly what it is supposed to be but not at all salty like an oyster cracker either. Overall, I will probably crush them to use as a cracker crumb, but will have to compensate with a lot of seasoning."
1025,Petmate Kennel Cab Fashion,0/0,3.0,"This might me okay for a small kitten but my 2 lb. maltese puppy didn't have room in it. I still have it and have never used it, I guess this will be another donation!!! It is cute because of the color this is the reason I ordered it but it is just to small."
1026,Hartz UltraGuard Plus Rid Worm Tab Dog,0/0,5.0,Item as described...repeat customer...will purchase again...great product...speedy delivery...would highly recommend product to others...pet didn't experience any side effects that I could see from the pills.
1027,Auto HandyBar Car Transfer Aid,0/0,5.0,"If you are fresh off a hip or knee replacement and want some additional help getting into a car, then this is the tool for you. It will fit all types of car latches and works great. It also can be used in an emergency to cut seat-belts or break glass."
1028,"Lambert Kay Fresh 'n Clean Pet Baby Powder Cologne Spray, 6-Ounce",0/0,1.0,"It is not working. My dogs fur starts to smell again after a few hours. I am an extreme nose person. So I am very sensitive to smells. This baby powder ""fragrance"" is nasty, I do not like it at all! My dog starts to sneeze as soon as I apply it and me too! Very disappointed about this product. I guess I am just going to throw around 10 $ in the trash!"
1029,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,"This bottle brush works extremely well when washing any kind of narrow container. I bought this to clean out my Thermos brand water bottles. The brush is about 12 inches long from top to bottom. The bristle portion of the brush is about 2 1/2 inches from one end to where the black handle starts. The bristles are very soft and the handle is long enough so you can use it on a variety of containers. Since it's made by Oxo, the handle is very comfortable. Bottles do need a good cleaning even when they're used for water only and this brush does a decent job."
1030,Uncle Milton Uncle Milton Giant Ant Farm,0/0,2.0,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. First of all, the ants are not included in the initial price. You have to purchase them online after you get the product and they will cost you another $5. When I received my ants, at least half of them were already dead. Already not off to a good start. After following all the directions, placing the ants in the farm along with a few drops of water and food I waited till the next day to see their progress. Well, all I found were dead ants! All of them died within 24hrs! I thinking you might be better off finding your own ants in the yard if you order this product."
1031,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,4.0,"I just ordered my 3rd of these beard trimmers. I use this on my face, head, and body. It does a really nice smooth job of cutting and does not pull hairs at all for me. Though I do not have very course hair. The only issue I have with it is the battery. When new it holds a charge for a pretty long time, several head and face trims. But as it gets older its loses charge over a year or two of regular usage. Not a big deal considering the low price. My main thing is that I REALLY wish Philips made a clone version of this trimmer that worked while plugged in so that if it dies in mid cut you could just plug it in and have it keep running. But I would still recommend it as is."
1032,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,2/3,2.0,"Since I live in the country that is using 220V instead of 110V,I still cannot use this product yet.I'm quite disappointed to find out that this product is using 110V, no information of this fact in the product review.To Amazon, please specify this information for all electricity-related products in the future.thank you"
1033,Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush,0/0,4.0,"Feels nice on my face, holds water and lather just fine. Lost about 20 bristles the first couple days, has since settled down to a tolerable 0-2 bristles per shave -- the only reason it gets four instead of five stars."
1034,Naturtint Permanent Golden Blonde 7G 2 Ounces,2/2,3.0,"While Naturtint does not damage my hair as much as other colorants, I would not say it is the best. It does damage it a bit and every time I use it I notice more breakage. The color washes out fairly quickly and it is a lighter color than pictured after a few washes. When I first dyed it, it looked very ashy and was not what I was looking for. I will keep looking for a better product that will cause less damage."
1035,The Original Magic Jetz Scrubz J22 Scrubber Sponge Round,2/2,5.0,"At first I thought it was too big and inflexible to use in the kitchen sink, but this sponge softened up quickly and became my favorite within days. Soft side and scrubbing side. Holds dish soap well, scrubs soft crusty stuck on grime. Also great for cleaning off knife blades - as long the cutting edge faces away. Appears it will last as long as a half-dozen sponges or more. So far, there is no odor, and it goes through the washing machine just fine (no dryer). Note"
1036,"Petmate Ultra Vari Kennel Fashion Pet Carrier, 26-Inch, For Pets 20-25 Pounds, Deer/Brown",0/0,2.0,"We chose this crate since it resembled the one our puppy was kept in by the shelter we picked her up from. She does love it, and feels secure in it. It's a good compromise between airy and den like.We purchased it on our way home from the shelter, and a surprisingly number of pet store employees recommended against it. They suggested all metal containers, to make cleaning easier. An all metal cage doesn't strike me as a homey den. So we didn't go with all metal.Cleaning has not been a problem with this crate. It easy to just spray it with a garden hose; shake it a little; and leave it face down to drain and dry. It can be dissabled also, if necessary.My one complaint, and it's a huge complaint by others as well, is the cheep clips that secure the top to the base. Our puppy has used the crate for 7 months now, and one of the clips is about shot. All the clips are cheep and hard to secure, but this one in particular has been the clip she has chosen to chew. A failure by any one of the five clips, renders the crate useless.I'm online looking for a new carrier, and would like to find a carrier similar to this one, but the cheep snapping side clips are a deal killer, since they are intended to hold the crate together. To the designer, may I suggest cheep spinning wingnuts, instead of cheep snapping clips."
1037,Cosmic Pet Shuttle Cardboard Carrier,0/0,1.0,My male cat tore thruogh it immediately. I did not have a spare so I had to use sturdy duct tape as a temporary remedy.Cute decorations but unless you are carrying a small placid mouse I can not recomend this product.
1038,MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation - Choose Colors -,0/0,4.0,"All women, young and old, have tried many make up products in their lives, whether it was an inexpensive brand or a high- priced brand. They have most likely tried products that irritated their skin, felt too heavy and spent money on products that didn't give them any coverage at all. MAC studio fix powder is the solution to all those problems. It is a product that women of any age and any color can use; this product is a good price for the economic problems, ladies might have and covers all the imperfections that women are afraid to show. I can relate to this product because I use it on a daily basis.MAC studio fix powder is a powder and a foundation combined in one and is very easy to apply, rather than going through the hassle of applying liquid foundation and then later applying a matte powder, the studio fix powder is a one-step application. This is good for women of any age, whether you're eighteen or fifty this would be a great to use. For teenagers the powder does an amazing job covering any acne that may occur, as well as dark circles and uneven skin tones. For women, age fifty and up, all the wrinkles and dark spots are erased within a blink of an eye. MAC studio fix powder is made in thirty- two different shades so any one is able to use it.If you've been spending too much money on products that don't work, you'll love how the studio fix powder is within a reasonable budget and how much coverage you can get from applying it once a day. This product feels very light on the skin and looks very natural too. Many powders can make your face look cakey and oily, the studio fix powder is very different; it makes your skin look flawless just like a celebrity's make up would. Many celebrities use MAC's merchandise because they love how it feels on their skin and after a long day it still looks nice. We all know who Kim Kardashian is, she is one of the many celebrities that uses this product on a daily basis and she uses it for a lot of her photo shoots. Not only is this great for everyday use, it looks beautiful when wearing it to parties.Some may argue that this powder makes your face oily and it feels heavy on the skin, but many women love this product and they use it all the time. Some also say that it can't be applied every day, only on special occasions, but depending on how much you apply is the result you'll get. From what reviews say online, this product is very good at covering all imperfections and it doesn't feel as heavy as other products may feel on the skin.After searching for a long time for a good product, many women say that the MAC studio fix powder, is by far the best ""two- in- one"" product out there. Almost every women can relate to make up because they all use it, so why not use something that you will love from the start. This powder is very good at giving a women full coverage and doesn't clog any of your pores like other powders may do. Lastly when you purchase this, you'll feel great knowing that you can have a portable powder and foundation in your purse at all times."

1040,"Duro-Med Flannel/Rubber Waterproof Sheeting, White",1/1,3.0,Ok so I use pads like these for my ferret's. They work good for absorption. Do not work well if you put them in the dryer. If you can't hang them to dry then look for something else. When they are put in the dryer the edges do curl up very badly. I found other pads from Kid-ding that are vinyl backed and they work better for putting in the dryer. I do like these for absorbing the fluid just do not like the fact that I can not put in dryer.

1042,"Yogi Healthy Fasting, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I love this tea by itself or combined with green tea, yerba Mate or other less flavorful teas. It's my favorite Yogi Tea! It does help curb appetite & energy boost too but I drink it for the flavor & health benefits."
1043,Jobst UltraSheer Mild Compression Pantyhose 8-15 mmHg,0/0,4.0,"The nylons are less fine than some support stockings out there, so they aren't to be worn with dresses. However, they do last longer and are more comfortable than some of the other brands. The maternity panel is comfortable. Jobst thigh highs last longer, but the sticky band can give you a rash. Over all, was fairly pleased with these."
1044,Cover Girl Outlast Smoothwear All-Day Smooth Feel Lipcolor Lip Glosses,0/0,5.0,"Most long wearing lip products tend to feel heavy on your lips and dry them out, but not the outlast smoothwear. it feels very comfortable on your lips, doesn't feel heavy, and gives your lips a kiss of moisture. don't stop making this awesome lip product, cover girl."
1045,"Promax 12 per pack, 2.64 oz. each",0/0,4.0,Feels like a hard toffee; also not sure if it promotes constipation but it surely doesn't make it easy to digest. Beware of the extra fat and calories they do have an impact so one might need to work harder to break even...It does taste good though unlike some other brands that taste horrible.
1046,Extra Wide Gate Extension 4Inch,0/0,5.0,This extension for my dog gate fit perfectly and looks good. Was also reasonably priced. I am thinking of ordering another gate and extension.
1047,Indigo Wild,0/0,5.0,"This soap and its various counterparts are the best type of goat soap that I have found on the market. Soft, smooth, with a very rich lather, it is the best for those with sensitive skin and even for those who don't. And if you don't like this smell, which is rather mild, there are about 20 other scents that on can choose from. Absolutely the best. Make sure that if you buy any of this brand of soap, to buy it from the company called Soap Hope. Very good company with fast and prompt service."
1048,Oxy-Powder Intestinal Cleanser,0/0,5.0,This product worked like a charm for me starting the following day. I feel great and I'm happy that I decided to order it after lots of research. I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.Happy customer !

1050,Squigle Enamel Saver Toothpaste,1/1,5.0,"I've had problems with canker sores (aphthous ulcers) for years. Sodium lauryl sulfate is often accused of being the key culprit, but it's not been easy to find a toothpaste that doesn't use it. Until now, Zinc and B6 supplements have helped. But then, a few months ago, into my life came Squigle. And it works better than anything else I've ever tried.Now, if I eat spicy foods or anything with cinnamon in it or accidentally bite the inside of my mouth and a red bump comes up, it goes away before it has a chance to turn ulcerous. For me that makes Squigle, while a good bit more expensive per ounce than other toothpastes, well worth it (although I'm really ticked off with myself for ordering two tubes from this particular Amazon page when I could have bought a 2-pack from another Amazon page for three or four dollars less. Ah, well, I'll know better next time and I wish the same to you.)But wait, there's more!! According to its label, Squigle also contains 36% xylitol...a product of nature derived largely from birch wood and sometimes known as wood sugar. And xylitol is the key ingredient in the do-it-yourself mouth care system recommended by Ellie Phillips DDS in her new bookKiss Your Dentist Goodbye"
1051,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,4.0,"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase. But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration. So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store. When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package. I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell. I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff. I was kind of disappointed. It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me. Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me. To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood. Very musky but weirdly comforting. I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me. I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature. For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours. For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers. For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit. There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example."
1052,PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,"This feeder is PERFECT. I have a miniature pinscher and she has to be fed at very exact times of the day. With this feeder, I get to make sure that I'm giving her the correct amount of food for her three meals a day AND I get to give her a Greenie to give her something to chew on in the middle of the day. I couldn't ask for more!I had been apprehensive about purchasing this feeder because of some of the reviews about difficulties in programming it. I didn't have a single problem. I'm starting to think that the people who had difficulty just chose to not read the instructions, which are VERY simple. The feeder WILL repeat your feeding schedule. You can program up to 12 feeding times. I only use four (three for food, one for the Greenie). I set the feeder up at 7:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 7:30 p.m. and it repeats that schedule every day. I had attempted to use the Bistro automatic feeder, and let me just say that that made me wary of using an automatic feeder ever again. It never could dispense the correct amount of food, even after I made some modifications to it. Now, that problem no longer exists. I know exactly how much food is being given to my dog and at what time.If you're looking for a simple feeder that is VERY reliable, then look no further. Seriously...there's almost no reason to be disappointed with this product if that's all you're needing. Whether you're getting this for a big or small dog or a cat, you just can't beat this."
1053,WalkFit Orthotic Insoles - - Available in Various Sizes,0/0,4.0,"I did the 3 day walk for 60 miles. I saw infomercial 5 days before the walk and bought them. During the walk, my arch was hurting. I put these in and it saved my foot! I couldn't keep them in for more than a few miles cause they hurt because I would think they just need to be slowly worked in to get used to. But I was worried I would have a hurt foot, and with these, my arch doesn't hurt and I made it through. So glad I found these!"
1054,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,1.0,"I was not very pleased this item at all, It didn't do what it said it would,the product said that it was a g-spot stimulation,I found it heavy and hard,all it did was make me spot tender."
1055,"Cadet 1-Pound Bully Sticks for Dogs, 4 to 6-Inch",0/0,5.0,"As the other reviews state, these things are quite pungent. We keep them in a ziploc bag and it does a good job of holding the smell in. Our dog loves, them, though, and they last many times longer than some of the cheap chews that we've gotten. We'll be purchasing more of these in a month or two, once our dog gets through this bag."
1056,Premier Pet Collar,0/0,5.0,"I looked for awhile for a black collar of this design for my two year old Belgian Turveren. The large size by this manufacturer is perfect. Adjusting it to a proper fit took seconds. Price seemed reasonable. Good solid weave nylon fibers, thick. Best of all, all the rings are metal; no plastic. Couldn't be more pleased. My pup seems to feel princely in it, as well."
1057,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,3/4,1.0,"This vibrator stopped working after less than 2 months. I've gotten hitachi wands before and they have lasted years. This one seemed a bit different from the wands I was used to, it felt like a cheap knock-off. Before quitting completely, I noticed that the vibrations gradually slowed down, as if the batteries were dying (even though it was plugged in). Very disappointed in this item."
1058,Large Pin Art/Black,0/1,4.0,"I gave this to an 8-year-old boy for his birthday, and he thought it was the coolest toy...and so did his 7-year-old sister. It kept them both entertained! It's a great gift for that age group -- it's different enough for the games/toys they are typically used to, and they think it's neat."
1059,Bare Escentuals BareMinerals,0/0,4.0,I love Bare Minerals makeup. It goes on so smooth you can hardly tell your wearing makeup. Its light and great in the warmer weather. My old makeup form years ago would make me sweat and my makeup run. This is really good makeup and does not do that. The only thing I dont like is the lock lid. It makes the last bit of makeup not come out of the container. I like the older lids Bare Minerals used to have.
1060,Comfort Zone with Feliway for Cats Diffuser and Single Refill,2/2,5.0,"We have been using this product for 6 months and first purchased at a nearby chain pet store. The price was nearly cut in half when ordering off of Amazon.We have six cats, 4 females and two males, mostly related. The girls started spraying in the house which I have never experienced before. We purchased Comfort Zone and did notice less spraying. What we forgot was to refill when it was empty. Bought some refills on Amazon as well for very low price.We think it works great!"

1064,"Nioxin Cleanser, System 3 (Fine/Treated/Normal to Thin-Looking)",17/17,1.0,"I tried this new formula cleanser and absolutely hate it. It made my hair flat and extremely hard to manage...an amazing amount of static. Is this formula change because P&G bought out the company? Anyway, I am running around the internet hoarding bottles of the original, wonderful, made in the USA, gold cap version that I've used for years. Don't know what I'll do when I run out of that!?!"
1065,Thermalon Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat Cold Neck Wrap For Neck And Shoulder,0/0,5.0,"Ice is my friend when I hurt. I have degeneration in my neck and this always makes it better. It isn't too heavy on my aching neck and shoulders. I keep in the freezer so it is ready to go at any time. And it doubles as an awesome heating pad with a little help from my friendly microwave. I couldn't 't ask for a better product! My first heating pad ""walked away"" from the kitchen one day so was glad to see Amazon still carries this. It is just as nice as my first one. I did notice that the bean smell was stronger on my first one, likely having become so over the years, and while the rest of the family doesn't like the smell of the beans, I have learner to enjoy because of the comfort I receive. Aaahh!!"
1066,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,This helped very much! I tried everything OTC and even hot sauces but my daughter still kept sucking her 2 fingers so her doctor said to try this and OMFG IT WORKED! Just put on a very tiny amount! It is very strong! I tried it my self and it tastes nasty. It took my daughter 1 week to stop but I still put a little every other day just in case she might want to start up again. I swear by this product and I highly recommend it!
1067,"Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce, 36-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I use hoisin sauce in many recipes as a key base ingredient. Mix in some garlic and ginger and a good soy sauce like sempio 501s and you have a great flavor base or combination for any asian cooking application. Be aware the 36 ounce container is a net weight not a fluid ounce size. Hoisin sauce is heavy by natural weight of ingredients and if you use it frequently this size may not be as much as you think. There is approximately three 8 fluid ounce cups per 36 ounce bottle. I just used an entire bottle making a marinade and a dipping sauce at one shot. This sauce is very good tasting and fits the bill nicely. The price is not too expensive nor is it cheap, it is reasonable. The bottle is plastic and squeezable and much easier to deal with than those ubiquitous small overpriced supermarket glass jars. Since the sauce is so heavy and slow moving like heavy ketchup try upturning the bottle so the sauce sinks to the cap when it is upside down and you will get the last drop. Good sauce, good value....recommended"
1068,"Alex 36"" X 36"" Vinyl Padded Playmat",0/0,5.0,"Love this product! Fun for any kid who enjoys cars/roads and it keeps the house organized! Easy to wipe clean, fold up, and store. Price was the cheapest on Amazon!"
1069,Twinlab 100% Whey Protein Fuel,0/0,5.0,Great deal - 2 packs (4 LBS total) of Strawberry Smash is only $27. Other brands sell 5 LBS at $45 to $53.Good taste - It tastes good and dissolves well.I recommend it.
1070,Venom Gloss,0/0,5.0,"I am completely addicted to Venom gloss. I have been using it for the past two years or so, and have finally thrown all the other partly-used tubes and tubs away. I just use this. I have extremely dry skin and the lips to go with it, and although I pay attention to staying hydrated, I need good lip protection the way a polar bear needs fur--it's just not optional. If I want to be comfortable and not have cracked, peeling lips, this is the ticket. Venom gloss stays on and on and on, all day practically if you don't eat stuff that wipes it off your mouth; and I put it on before I go to bed, too. It has peppermint (and I forget what other things) in it to give it a bit of a ""sting,"" which I really enjoy, though if it makes my lips plumper, I haven't noticed. Or cared. I just wish it came in more colors!!!"
1071,Honest Tea Just Green Tea Unsweetened 64 Fl. Oz.,0/0,5.0,"Words cannot even begin to describe my love for this tea. I was looking for an authentic unsweetened tea that contained a substantial amount of antioxidants. This tea was it. It's organic. It has no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. It's Fair Trade Certified. It has a ton of antioxidants. Oh, and did I mention how energized I feel after drinking it? Just Green Tea is the real deal. I lucked out because I live close to a Wegmans, who carries the 64 fluid ounce bottle at a good price. This tea is wonderful for health-conscious folks, those seeking to lose weight, college students who have an 8 A.M. class, and tea connoisseurs. Five stars for the product, one star for the Amazon price."
1072,ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,0/0,5.0,With a mild smooth taste of coconut and water this stuff is REFRESHING. its not too sweet and its just super refreshing when you pull it out of the fridgeone great way to serve it is on crushed ice in a slushee style thingy
1073,Solvit 62313 Waterproof Bench Seat Cover for Pets,1/1,3.0,"Does the job of protecting car back seat from muddy paws. However, my dog apparently didn't really care for the texture of the material. My dog would try to avoid sitting or laying on the cover if possible and appeared uncomfortable at first. Took her awhile to get used to the material maybe because it is like a rough plastic feel. I noticed that more of the loose dog hairs just stuck to the material and would not come off after spraying with garden hose. Overall, the product protects the seat but your dog may have to get use to the material and may require more maintenance to clean/remove dog hair."
1074,Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,5.0,"I am very happy with my new seat cover. I had 4 larges dogs in my back seat and the cover worked very well. The cover stayed put and protected my seat, even with all the dogs and their activity."
1075,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,1/1,5.0,"We had a problem with our 2 dogs who stay outside - one would bark excessively. We tried a shock collar first, but it did not work. I think our dog had too much hair in the way, plus I just didn't like the thought of shocking him. This spray of citronella worked perfectly. We had one small snag, his sister chewed the collar off him, but we secured it to another collar and he has kept it on. We were on the verge of getting rid of the dogs, so we are thankful this collar worked! Now we just have to listen to all the neighbor dogs bark -we have considered telling them about this collar."
1076,BABYBJORN Potty Chair,0/8,1.0,"Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk. If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time. Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell. Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip."

I liked that there were a few openings in the carrier so I could put my hand in and pet him to calm him down. The bottom of the carrier was sturdy enough for me to put a little cup of water in for him. There's plenty of ventilation, it's stylish, and it fit perfectly under the seat in front of me on the plane. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."

1079,LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166),0/1,5.0,"We like buying LEGO for our kids. They have lots of fun building all kinds of different things. This is a basic starting LEGO set for 4 years + with very high quality. The LEGO pieces are colorful and sturdy, will not fall apart easily. This is quite important as kids at this age (4+) easily get frustrated when their work falls apart. 405 pieces are a lot although we will definitely buy much more later. I believe this LEGO set is a good choice and I also buy it as gifts. The price is reasonable too."
1080,"Swanson Premium Brand Turmeric Whole Root Powder, 720 mg, 100 Gelatin Caps",2/2,1.0,"I bought these for my tendonitis and carpel tunnel. I have read about the amazing benefits of using turmeric but unfortunately these made me feel horrible! I had terrible gastrointestinal pain. I had read that some people may experience this and unfortunately I was one of them. When I tried to return them, I was told basically that its not their problem if I had stomach issues :("
1081,Final Fantasy Advent Children Cloud Strife & Fenrir Motorcycle Action Figure Deluxe Set,0/0,5.0,they offer a positive service. from their high quality service and the price is worth to buy. i like it very much.
1082,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"Love the color, but it dries matte. It's not a matte polish. So I don't know what is wrong with that."
1083,Cacharel Noa For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for! The seller was very fast with the delivery and the perfume arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely buy from this shop again!As for the perfume -- If you're looking for something a little lighter, almost floral and something that won't make your eyes water because it's so unbelievably potent then this is the scent for you! It smells a little strong for a minute but then it mellows and becomes so gentle and lasts all day! (woo!)"
1084,"Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat, Medium, Highland Maize",0/0,5.0,This is perfect for our Boston Terrier! He loves taking rides now and runs to the car waiting for one of us to get him all hooked up for a ride.
1085,Tea Tree Therapy Pure Tea Tree Oil,0/0,5.0,"Should the face only a mother could ever love be encrusted w a nasty pimple or two... Ive found tea tree to zap out and heal zits. It may not smell inviting, but you can get used to a gamey herbal scent...especially if you want that gooey red puss filled pimple to heal. Totally worth your investment."
1086,H2ocean-Piercing Aftercare Spray,0/0,5.0,"I rarely write reviews, which says something about this amazing product. After getting my nose pierced I was experiencing extreme redness, swelling, discomfort, and the formation of the ""bump"". I bought this product just a few days after and within 24 hours it appeared completely normal. I was so excited and I have not had any problems at all and will continue to use this product daily."
1087,Kelp (Iodine Source) 225 mcg 250 Tabs - Swanson Premium,2/2,4.0,I have used Kelp as a dietary aid for my thyroid for some time but have always purchased it at health food stores. This product was the same quality at a fraction of the cost. Very pleased with seller as was delivered promptly.
1088,Treat Dispensing Chew Ball,0/0,5.0,This is the second ball that I have purchased. I purchased a second one because we have a German Shepherd puppy along with two other dogs. I purchased the first one about six years ago and it is still going strong. It has gone through 2 GSD.
1089,Super Colon Cleanse with Herbs & Acidophilus By Health Plus - 240 Capsules,1/1,5.0,"I've been using this product for about 3 years. It keeps me regular without discomfort. I don't use it everyday. But when I know the conditions are right for a problem I start taking this. Great for traveling, especially road trips!"
1090,Lupine Designer Combo Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,"I love Lupine products. They're durable, nice-looking collars (with matching leads) and made in the USA! Can't beat the quality! I've had several of their items for years, and they all hold up very well."
1091,"Oster Professional Pet Grooming Comb, 7-inches Med/Coarse",0/0,5.0,"As described, performs as advertised. Lifts cat's long fur and doesn't seem to hurt. Steel and sturdy. And it came quickly."
1092,Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit Eyebrow Makeup,0/0,5.0,"I am not usually one to review anything, but this eyebrow kit is the best method I have tried to fill in my thinning brows. A few years back, an overzealous waxing job left the inner part of my eyebrows bald, and since then have never grown in; the rest of my brow is thinning as I age. This kit with its stencils is such an easy step in my makeup and having well defined brows makes me look younger and better. The powder is exactly the right texture, there are enough stencils that I am able to use the thin version of the stencil and still not look like I have drawn anything in. The powder doesn't smudge like some that I have tried, and it stays on all day. No one can tell that I have virtually no brows to speak of, they look so natural when I finish off by using a spooly afterwards. The irid brown is exactly the right colour for my hair and overall tone (I am brunette). The spa that I bought this originally quit selling it, and I tried their replacement, have tried many other brow powders, pencils, etc., and I just had to find this one again. LOVE it!"
1093,Maha Powerex MH-C808M 8 Cell Multi-Charger for AA/AAA/C/D,1/1,5.0,"I bought two of these based on reviews on this site and I am very happy I did. These chargers work great and I love that they can take up to 8 D-cell batteries as well as taking other sizes of batteries. I also think it's great that they have the ""soft charge"" a fast charge and a reconditioning mode for the batteries. This should keep all my batteries working at their peak for a long time. Thanks for a great product!"
1094,Mango Cream Flavor Powder (1 lb) [Bubble Tea Powder],1/1,1.0,"waste of money, came late too, it does not taste anything like mango, in fact it tastes like a bad formula for kids"
1095,Four Paws 2.5mm 15-Feet Medium Weight Tie Out Chain for Dogs,0/0,1.0,My dog was well under the recommended weight and broke it within a few days. I bought a solid cable that has a plastic coating and couldn't be happier!
1096,Hot Tools Professional 1199 Soft Heat Ceramic+Titanium 1-1/2 Inch Wide Flat Iron,1/1,4.0,"I've had this flat iron since 2007 and it is still doing a great job. It leaves my hair silky and shiny and does not damage my hair. A few reviewers have mentioned that their hair has gotten caught between the plate and the handle - this has happened to me here and there, but it was due to the way I was holding the iron and positioning my hair.If you're looking for an inexpensive iron that will last, Hot Tools is a great place to start."
1097,Dog Tie Out Chain,0/0,1.0,My dog was well under the recommended weight and broke it within a few days. I bought a solid cable that has a plastic coating and couldn't be happier!
1098,"San Pellegrino Chinotto 6 pack, 6.75 oz bottles",1/1,4.0,"I love all the Sanpellegrino sodas (except the lemon one actually- so I love the green, red and orange color cans but not yellow) and I bought this assuming it would be similar. It is not really in the same vein at all as the others but it is fabulous. First sip, having no warning, I did not love it. But now that I know what's going on here I am thinking this would have been THE wine substitute while I was pregnant. I guess there may be other times in the future I need a non-alcoholic special beverage. This is it."
1099,Jolly Pet Teaser Ball,1/1,1.0,"After only one hour of play time with my 7 month old JRT, this product failed.The edges of the circles began to crumble off, and when I touched it a deepdark blue came off on my fingers.I would not recommend this product to ANY pet owner."
1100,Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat,0/0,4.0,This product arrived on time and as expected. It is a good product and would recommend it to others to use.
1101,Playskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary),0/0,4.0,The toy is what it is. It's fun for short periods of time. It's good for motor skills and showing kids that things go away & come back.
1102,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"very good product, fast order and excellent for the price. I loved it because it is just what I was looking for and they sell"
1103,Cameroon Boyo Coffee,0/0,3.0,"I've bought Cameroonian arabica beans from a Co-OP in the Northwest Province. These were the sweetest, richest coffee beans I've ever tasted. Too bad the government had to put the local growers out of business. I'd hoped to find the taste of these beans to be in the same league; but, no dice. They were a decent bean, but not for the price."
1104,Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 Pack,0/0,4.0,We've been using these with our VentAire Plus bottles since it's so hard to find Fast and Medium flow nipples for those bottles. So if you're running a Playtex wide mouth bottle you can't go wrong with these.
1105,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,0/0,5.0,"Love this product! I received it very fast and works really well!! This is the second Waterpik I bought (one for me, one for my boyfriend) and both work like they are suppose too! Would buy again!"
1106,"Simple Solution Stain & Odor Remover, 32 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"We have a english sheephound puppy who's growing by the day. This product has been priceless in dealing with the puppy's accidents on the carpet. There is no scent left of the accident which means the puppy isn't as likely to go there again. As time has gone on, he's gotten a lot better but for the first several months, this was a lifesaver. Highly recommend."
1107,Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Dry Dog Food,0/1,2.0,We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.
1108,Red Folding Soft Sided Carrier Crate for Pets up to 25 lbs.,0/0,4.0,"I bought this carrier for my 12 lb cat, and it is huge. That's a good thing though, he is able to stand and lay down comfortably, and the plush bottom is easy to remove and clean. At first I was concerned that the mesh wouldn't hold up if he clawed it, but it appears to be very durable, and he didn't do any damage when he scratched. I like all the little storage spots attached, I can easily fit his water/food bowls, and food. He likes the open airy design because he can see around him and that keeps him calm.The only reason I didn't give five stars is the fact that there is only a shoulder strap for carrying it around. It's a big and slightly bulky, so it would have been nice if there had been two straps to carry it in one hand."
1109,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,The perfume came in a wrapped package and everything seems to look like the same item sold in department stores. At first the scent wasn't really what I remember the scent to have been like when I bought it from Macy's a couple years ago. It however did start to smell the same after a while on my body. Maybe body chemistry? I dont know. It lasts a couple hours too so I really like it. Love the scent. Very safe packaging and the size of the perfume is pretty big! I would buy it again.
1110,"Canfield's Soda Chocolate Fudge Diet, 6-Count(Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"I love this stuff.Unfortunately you can almost never get it in California(the 99 cent store had it for a short time,but sold out quickly and hasn't had it for several months).Fortunately.I was able to get it through Amazon with free shipping.I now have six cases and I'm a happy camper.Shipping was pretty quick too.This soda satisfies my need for a chocolate taste but has no calories.Paul Koenig"
1111,Plan Toys Dancing Alligator,0/0,5.0,"This toy makes our daughter run and smile and laugh. We all love this toy. It is durable, cute, and as far as noisy toys go, pleasant sounding. Great gift. Our daughter received it for her 1st birthday and at 17mos it is still going strong every day. FUN! I can't wait to buy one for my nephew's first birthday.I gave 3 for educational value. It does encourage some problem solving when the string gets tangled on the gator."
1112,Angel By Thierry Mugler For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray Refill 3.4 Ounces,4/4,1.0,"Received item in a timely manner. But the first thing I noticed was the item was rewrapped in Thierry Mugler paper. When I opened the wrap the box said "" tester"" . Ive ordered this product a minimum of 5 xs and never seen it wrapped. It has always come in a black box sealed in plastic from other vendors. Then I looked at the color. Its not as blue as the real Angel. I held it up to another bottle of previously purchased Angel and the difference in color is very noticeable. Now the scent. Watered down. The thing I love about the real Angel is its longevity. This stuff I purchased started to fade in less than 20 minutes. Im very unsatisfied and now I know to purchase from my reliable vendor for Angel. Thought I was getting a deal but got hosed."
1113,Nutranail 5 to 7 Day Growth Aloe Formula .45 oz.,0/0,5.0,"Okay, first of all, I have rock hard nails that grow so fast I am always cutting them. I don't need harder nails. Unfortunately, one of my nails somehow got a fungus (I have no idea how, I wash my hangs about every 2-3 hours). I bought fungus nail stuff at the drug store and that stopped the fungus and prevented my nail from looking worse. Unfortunately, my nail had detached almost halfway down my nail bed and looked horrible. I got this product because I needed my nail to get healthy again and grow out so it would attach again. This helped a lot. My nail grew fast and stopped looking like it had pits in it. My nail had also thinned a lot which this stuff seemed to fix. I don't know how much was just my nail healing on it's own and how much was this product, but I would use it again. Apply it often though, keep the nutrients on your nail. In personal experience, green tea isn't bad for ANYTHING."
1114,LCR - Left Center Right Dice Game - Random Color,0/0,5.0,LCR is the most fun game to come out in a long time. There were 12 of us playing it 8 adults and 4 children. The time flew by and the children learned how to count the chips or money it was great playing LCR game. I recommend this game for a very fun evening.
1115,RID-X - Septic System Treatment 1-Dose Powder 9.8 Ounce,0/1,5.0,"Excellent product. We use it once a month (using Amazon's autoship). Just pour into your toilet, flush twice, that's all. Pick a time of the day that won't require flushing such as before going to bed. It works more effectively that way.No septic problems."
1116,Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,0/0,4.0,The product works great. My eyelashes maintain a perfect curl all day long. The only negativity would be that it requires a fairly new to new battery at all times or it won't heat. That can be annoying when you think it's been heating for the last 5 minutes.
1117,Chocolate Cacao Nibs,0/0,5.0,I've already ordered more of these. I use a scoop of these in my morning smoothies. Great organic product. It arrived before the expected date.
1118,"Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs, Extra-Large Pad",1/1,5.0,Great product. I have blind and arthritic senior cat. She uses pads instead of litter box. It saves my floors from constant clean up.
1119,Kyjen Oakley the Octopus Junior Plush Pet Toy,0/0,3.0,"This is a very cute toy and kept my puppy entertained for a few days. Until he ripped it apart. My 6 month old puppy tore this cute little toy apart in a matter of days. So if you have a dog that likes to chew, this toy is not for you."
1120,CK IN2U For Women By CALVIN KLEIN Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"came perfect, quick, and the scent i adore!can't ask for anything else! i will buy this again, from the same vendor when i run out!"
1121,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,"I'm not trying to hype this up, but this is honestly some of the best soap I have used.I use it for hair, facewash, and bodywash. If you plan on doing the same you have to keep a few things in mind. This stuff is rather concentrated, so don't use as much as normal. Also, it has no lathering agents, so you have to do that on your own. It took me a little getting used to but I am happy I made the switch. Also, I bought a 16 ounce for like 9 bucks and didnt have to get shampoo, body, or facewash again for about 3 months. Cost effective much?For hair, put a little in your palm and lather it up, then put it in your hair. scrub as usual. If your hair is especially dirty, rinse and do it again. Once I started using this product I stopped washing my hair every day, and only rarely use conditioner now. You might want to do the same and see how it goes. A lot of people think that it will get greasy and gross, and maybe yours will, I dont know. For me however, a day or two after washing with this soap is when my hair looks its best. Its not greasy and gross, but it looks more natural, and is easier to manage. Honestly it awesome, try it out.For face and body, just toss a bit on a washcloth or scrubber and lather it, then wash away.The peppermint feels great, and smells good too. I have tried the citrus and almond as well and they both are nice too."
1122,"Energizer A23 Battery, 12 Volt - 2 Pack",0/0,5.0,Havent had to use batteries yet however as my fan remote started working on old batteries. I hope they are fully juiced when I do need them.Mark
1123,Golden Alaska Deep Sea Omega-3-6-9 Fish Oil 1000mg,1/1,1.0,"I am sure this product performs adequately, but this was my first experience with an off-brand Omega vitamin. I usually purchase NOW brand, and will continue to spend any extra for that brand. After taking this product I was taken by complete surprise after my morning diet coke; I had a huge burp which absolutely REEKED of dead fish! Perhaps other products acquire the vitamin content differently, but this was a ghastly surprise... I will continue to spend any extra to ensure I don't get that fishy taste again."
1124,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,0/0,5.0,Nothing special here. I needed new cutting blades for my electric razor. I picked this vendor because the price was right and the customer satisfaction score was high. The product was received in a timely matter and put directly to use. No problems.
1125,Bigelow Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,Constant Comment has been one of my very favorite teas for almost 50 years!! I love the flavor and the taste and it is great to mix with other teas for a large pitcher of iced tea - thank you for making it available on Amazon!!
1126,StarMark Clicker Dog Training System,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this to help trin my dog it is made of a very durable plastic. It makes a good sharp ""click"" sound when used, perfect for marking a dog's behavior. It has an open area for a lanyard but alas it comes with no lanyard nor is one offered so I ordered one separately which is a little inconvenient. Overall though I gave it as 5/5 becasue it's perfect for dog training and works as promised."
1127,"Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact, Large and Medium Roller",0/0,5.0,the best hot irons i ever had. my hair is long so i ended up needing two sets of them. they do heat up fast and the meatal tabs are hardcore. i like it. good buy
1128,"Manna Pro 0806980236 Insoluble Crushed Granite Poultry Grit for Birds, 5-Pound",1/2,5.0,"Easy to order via Internet, as opposed to traipsing around to locate it in a pet store!! Very convenient and saves gas that is now $4.00."
1129,LABRADA NUTRITION Lean Body Meal Replacement Formula,0/0,3.0,I've been using Lean Body Shakes for a while now. They've always tasted great but this last shipment tasted chalky and was quite difficult to drink. I'm not sure if they changed the formula or if I got a bad batch but its enough to make me cancel my subscription to my monthly purchase and go another route. I'm very disappointed.
1130,VTech - V.Smile Adapter,0/1,4.0,"Got the item as described, what can you say about an AC adapter? I plugged it in, it works, my kid stays the hell off of my iPhone because they have power for their innotab and balance is restored to the universe. It arrived just as it was described. looks good and works so no issues at all. It was a good transaction.Thanks Amazon, Chubby Hubby"
1131,"Coconut Chips, 1 lb.",0/1,3.0,"Taste pretty average, and a little bit dry.Okay for some uses, or for eating plain, but I have had better."
1132,Mighty Leaf Variety 15 Bags,0/0,5.0,Great quality product. A perfect way to sample the wide range of Mighty Leaf teas. I highly recommend for the tea lover in your home.
1133,Jolly Pet Rubber Squirrel,0/0,5.0,My Lab loved chewing on this toy...would buy a larger one the next time as this one was a little too small for a large dog.
1134,"Lever 2000 Moisturizing Bar, Pure Rain - Eight 4.5oz. Bars",1/1,5.0,I love this soap and it has been discontinued....I don't like the others that the company makes.I'll have to order more
1135,Miracle Coat No Fly Zone for Dogs 12 oz.,0/0,1.0,"For some reason flies have set up home base in my dog run even though I spray it down with cleaner and bleach regularly, wash my dog often and brush his coat, pick up his mess and wash away his urine daily. I've even hung fly traps but they are in mass quantities, it's frustrating. So I wanted to give my poor pup some respite and got this to spray on him and his bedding (that is washed and changed daily) but I can spray this directly on a fly and they come right back and land on his bed. I soaked his bed with it right after a washing, still flies. I've sprayed my dog thoroughly and taken minutes to brush him thoroughly to make sure its on every strand of his fur, still flies come as soon as I stop brushing him. I used the bottle up just so as not to waste it but it did not work even a tiny little bit. I wouldn't buy it."
1136,American Baby Company Percale Crib Sheet,1/1,5.0,"The material and color has held up over a year of use with multiple washes. The color is exactly as shown. Great product, highly recomend."
1137,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,"This is the best fountain by far that I have ever purchased, it is low profile, it is easy to clean and to fill, and my pets love it."
1138,Kaytee Supreme Diet for Guinea Pig,0/0,5.0,Our guinee pig is almost 6 years old and doesn't like nor eat the fancier food with the treats included in it. Wal=mart had been the cheapest and only supplier of the plain pellets till recently when they stopped stocking it. Local pet store was charging 1.85 per pound so this is a good buy plus its also a pound larger size then what wal-mart carried.
1139,Bass Brushes Lg. Oval Hair Brush Wood Bristles,3/3,4.0,"I have recently ordered both the Widu and this brush, so I can directly compare them for me. The Widu brush is a bit softer on my scalp; the Bass is slightly sharper and feels stronger and a bit rougher. I prefer the Widu, but not by much and the price is a lot better for the Bass. Overall, I much prefer either of these brushes to regular plastic bristle brushes. I am a swimmer and these are a lot more gentle on my hair after swimming."
1140,Wild Strawberry Jam Andresy All natural French jam pure sugar cane 9 oz jar Confitures a l'Ancienne,1/1,3.0,"If you have been to France and had their Wild Strawberry jam and know how amazing it is-this product might disappoint. It is still a decent product, but I have found better in Dean and DeLuca (granted that jam was $17). For the price of this product, I probably wouldn't purchase it again, maybe if the price was lowered."
1141,Mustela Bebe Baby Shampoo 6.76 fl oz (200 ml),0/0,5.0,"Being a new mom, I want to know that products perform well, are safe, and worth buying again. We have been using this shampoo for our little girl for at least six months and we love it. The product lasts a long time, smells great, and very importantly, rinses cleanly. Our daughter has sensitive skin so we are very choosy about bath products. She is also in a phase now where she dislikes getting her face wet/ soapy, so the clean (fast) rinsing of this produt is key. I just purchased another bottle today. Would buy again, recommend to friends and have given as a gift to other new moms!"
1142,"Carlson 0930PW Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door, White",0/0,4.0,Love the gate. It works perfectly to keep my dog out of the areas i don't want him in. Also like that i don't have to put holes in my door frame to use it.
1143,Nature's Way B-100 Complex,0/0,5.0,I like he B 100 from this company. I have noticed a difference in the way I fell. I used to take a b-50 complex but I think I well start taking the b-100.
1144,Calcium & Magnesium 240 sgels,1/1,5.0,"This was a very good value for the price, as compared to all the chain pharmacies, even walmart.I would recommend it heartily."
1145,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,"I got one of these for each of my dogs. They work but the dogs still fight it everytime I put it on them. One even rubbed the skin off her nose trying to get it off. BUT, it does calm them down and makes them walk nicely (when they're not fighting it). Probably just need more individual work before trying to walk them both together. I'd buy them again."
1146,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,5.0,"My wife bought these and she's very pleased with the ""sheer"" quality, just like regular stockings. She previously bought a pair of the same brand from the same supplier, and they were not sheer, but she's satisfied to have both types."
1147,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),1/1,5.0,This is a review for Beetlejuice Blu-Ray. The video transfer from Warner Bros. is pretty good given the films 25 yr pedigree. On my disc you must manually select the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless auidio track; it defaults to the Lossy DD 5.1.The Orig. 1.85:1 is slightly stretched to properly fill a 16:9 screen. Danny Elfman's musical score is showing its age as it is not as crisp as a typical new movie. Although it is noticebly better than the DVD audio track.It was a must have to fill my ever growing Blu-ray collection!
1148,Numi Organic Tea Flowering Gift Set in Handcrafted Mahogany Bamboo Chest,1/1,4.0,"This gift was a big hit. It has a cool look to the product as well as the actual tea. The shipping box arrived in a little bit of a beaten up state, but the glass pot was packaged very well and was in perfect condition. The only two issues I had with this was the chest is pretty cheaply made and began to come apart as I spent almost a half and hour picking off the glue residue (the second issue). If you know a tea lover, this is overall a pretty nice gift to give."
1149,Videonow FX Player Ice Blue,0/0,1.0,"These were cool when they came out, but now I can't find anything for it. The screen is too small and they breakdown easily."
1150,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,"Great service, Product was better than expected,very sturdy cage, bought similar product at petsmart awhile back ,not as good,also price was about half that of petsmart,will definitely purchase here again.. Patrick"
1151,"Conair Quick Gems Hair Jeweler, Purple",1/1,5.0,"I was out shopping over the summer and happened to see this product on an endcap of the linen store (BB&B). It was priced on clearance for $4, but I quickly looked up online reviews for it, since I had never heard of this product before. I was pleasantly surprised to find the ""regular"" price of the product was significantly higher and that it had gotten great reviews. So I purchased it and hid it away for 2 months, awaiting my daughter's 7th birthday. Well, I just gave it to her and she loves it. She wanted them in her hair, even though it was almost bed time. Since I don't know how well these stay in overnight and the ""refills"" cost more than 4x what I paid for the unit, I told her we'd have to take them back out before going to bed. She wanted to try it out anyhow. I'm terrible with doing anything but brushing hair, but even being so inept, I was able to figure this tool out quickly. My daughter was able to almost do it herself, but did need a bit of help positioning her hair. That's fine, it's nice mother/daughter time. And I have no doubt that it won't be long before she gets it figured out on her own. I was nervous about how difficult it would be to remove the gems, but they came out very easily with reading the directions on the best way to remove them. It took maybe 5 minutes to fill up her hair with the pre-loaded gems (the unit has a few extras and I actually put those away to use as ""replacements"" for when we inevitably wind up losing some), and then when we were ready to remove the gems, it took maybe another 5 minutes. My daughter has some sensory issues and can't stand her hair being pulled, like when we have to remove a pony tail holder, but removal of the gems didn't pull on her hair at all. I would definitely recommend this product. And even at the price listed on amazon, I would consider purchasing it again to give out as birthday gifts."
1152,Executive Sandbox A Day at the Beach,0/0,4.0,Love this little sandbox. Very relaxing to play in the sand while relaxing at home! Love the beach theme but comes in other themes too.
1153,eb5 Facial Cream,0/0,1.0,"I am not happy with the eb5 Facial Cream. I felt like my skin looked worse not better. I tried to call the company to stop the automatic shipment, and give my complaints but they would not give me the help I needed. They explained that they could only give the information to the corporate headquarters and they would call me. I explained that I was leaving on a vacation in 3 days, and could not wait around for a phone call, so to make sure the auto shipments were canceled. Of course the company called when I was not at home, and then continued to send auto shipments. I am extremely angry, and would like to know a phone number that actually gets hold of someone that can help me."
1154,O Oui! Perfume by Lancome for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"Every time I traveled overseas I would buy my wife a coming home gift. Many times it was a bottle of parfum or cologne. This fragrance to me has a light and floral fragrance that my wife loves. She no longer likes the heavier fragrances and the lighter for her, the better. This one for me has the scent that is light, floral and sweet. It must be the honeysuckle in the mixture.My wife lightly sprays her neck and one wrist which she rubs to the other. She and I both prefer a light and sensual fragrance that is not overdone. This is one of her favorites and she likes it a lot. She rates it 5 stars. I have included a photo for your reference."
1155,PetSafe SlimCat Interactive Toy and Food Dispenser,0/0,4.0,"I LOVE this item, but my cats are not so sure. My female (who is usually the dumb one!) figured it out in the first day. The boys aren't so sure. They will come running now when they hear me roll it or shake it, but they haven't figured out how to roll it themselves. But they're going to have to figure it out because I am cutting down on their food bowls. I'd actually like to buy several of them to have around the house because each one holds about 1/4 to 1/2 of their normal daily food intake. I think that would force them to cut back without totally starving them."
1156,Apex Apex Deluxe Pill Splitter,0/0,5.0,"Such a simple concept but works beautifully. A quick snap to chop your pill, I chop mine in to fours. The rubber pad keeps the pill in place for the blade."
1157,BD DigitalThermometer,1/1,3.0,"There is a lot of beeping. This thermometer beeps every four seconds to let you know that it is still in the correct place. It also takes a long time, so that is a lot of beeping, plus a lot of fast beeps when it is finished. The display lights up, but only if you push the power button when it is done. But if you push the button for too long, it turns off instead. It's an okay product in that it works and i don't have much trouble with the display. It could be better, but it could be worse, too."
1158,Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,2/5,1.0,"We borrowed one of these from friends to use with our newborn and I hate it so much that I considered buying one just so that I could destroy it.The side does not drop down far enough to be useful for breastfeeding, and the bed attachment mechanism is wonky. Also, the fit and finish is terrible, and the fabric smells like plastic. My wife pinched a nerve in her hip doing the strange yoga move required to get the baby out of this thing without getting out of bed. Ultimately we moved it away from the bed so that she can simply stand up and pick the baby up, which turns out to be considerably easier and less painful.If you hired a team of mechanical engineers to design the world's worst folding mechanism, you could do no better than the team who conceived and produced this. There are 7 gazillion moving parts, some of which hinge, some of which slide, and some of which zip. The hinges are hidden behind fabric and require an enormous amount of pressure on a very small area (~3mm circular) to unlatch.Lest you think this is hyperbole, take as an example the manufacturer's **22 PAGE** instructions on how to fold down the bassinet:[...]Run far away, then buy a $50 Fisher Price Snug-A-Bunny."
1159,"Fantastic World Foods Vegetarian Sloppy Joe Mix, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",1/1,5.0,"I first tried this product when sold in my grocery store, it was wonderful. Of course when I go back to purchase more, they had stopped selling the product so I had to find it. I am glad I did, this is the second order of 12 purchased. I do the spruced up recipe and it is wonderful. I even have my non-vegetarian spouse and children eating without asking any questions. It is easy to fix, tasty, and is a great source of protein. I really want to try some of their other products."
1160,Enjoy Sulfate Free Hydrating Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"This is really great shampoo but be careful when ordering through Amazon as it can be watered down. I used to buy from a local store but decided to purchase through Amazon because it is a little cheaper. I have now made two purchases of this shampoo through Amazon and both times experienced a watered down product. Instead of being a thick creamy consistency it was watery and just ran off my hand when tipped out of the bottle. It's not at all helped by the ridiculously large hole in the bottle (which is an issue I have with Enjoy's new packaging). Anyway, great product but buy locally and contact Amazon if you have received watered down product through any of their vendors."
1161,Aspercreme - Pain Relieving Creme,0/0,4.0,"My Mom likes this product, as a diabetic, it totally helps with her foot pain and any lumps that turn up."
1162,Bottom Buddy,0/0,4.0,I'VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AWHILE AND I PREFER IT TO OTHER BRANDS. THE HANDLE COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER SINCE AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER I'M HAVING A HARDER TIME BENDING AND REACHING THE AREA BUT IT HOLDS THE PAPER BETTER AND IS STRONGER .
1163,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Im 26, and this is by far the best fragance from Nautica. Really fresh, young, cool and clean. If you into surf, skate, soccer or crossfit you'll love this one."
1164,Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,1/1,1.0,Just took the cat to the vet who were instantly skeptical that it was real. Its not the same thing based on where its made and this stuff is made in france not the USA and the people I spoke too said it very much makes a difference. I couldn't be more pissed off.
1165,Battat Take Apart 4X4,0/0,5.0,The grandchildren love the take apart toys - so got two more. Love learning how to use a drill and change out the bits.
1166,Mustela Dermo-cleansing,0/0,5.0,"I love Mustela products!!!! And this product is no exception. I used this for my toddler when she was a baby and then ventured off and tried various other products such as Sebamed,which is also great! But one day while bathing my daughter, I found a sample bottle that I had received in one of the Mustela orders; when I smelled this stuff, I was in awe and love again. It reminded me of when my baby (3.5 years old) was an actual baby and reminded me how much I love this product and the smell! It never created any rash or any other harsh reactions and the smell is heavenly! So needless to say we are switching back to Mustela for my baby, but also for me. I always want nothing but the best for my baby and Mustela is the best!"
1167,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,This is the best animal brush I have ever used. I use it on my dog and my cats and they all love it. It works fantastic.
1168,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,5.0,"Our oldest cat is coming up on 10 years of age and is around 15 lbs. She has a tough time making all of the way up to our bed at night, or up to her old favorite window. We have gotten other pet stairs in the past that she will have nothing to do with, but she took right to these as soon as we got it out of the box. Excellent purchase!"
1169,"Lifoam 4971 Hot 'n Cold Reusable Ice Pack, 26 ounce",0/0,2.0,"I bought four of these to add to a cooler to keep beverages cold without wasting ice or the mess of melting things.It does that alright, however, every single one of them have begun to leak a very chemical smelling, off yellow liquid.I contained this problem with the quart sized freezer ziplock bags.Also, to heat up you have to fully cover in water, and the product doesn't get very hot. (I have only heated one, and that one leaks worse than the others.)Considering the price, I suppose the deal wasn't so bad, as I am able to use them for my intended purpose."
1170,Dutch Blitz,0/0,5.0,"I LOVE this game. Everybody I know that has played this game LOVES this game. I have given it as a gift on several occasions to people who I have played it with because they enjoy it so much. It's pretty easy to learn, but it does take some time to get to really get a good grasp and be able to play quickly. I taught a group of eight year olds to play. Some caught on more quickly than others, of course, but it is an incredibly fun game that people will want to play constantly. One of my favorite things to do is combine a few packs, giving each pack some sort of mark on the back of every card to differentiate the cards. This allows for more than four players, and it can definitely get very crazy and very fun."
1171,Webkinz Tree Frog,0/1,4.0,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday which isn't until November, I bought it has kind of a gag gift she'd freak everytime she saw a frog around the swimming pool.She likes tree frogs though so I decided to get her one."
1172,Alberto VO5 Shampoo for Normal Hair - 15 fl oz,0/0,5.0,"Great price, great shampoo and no silly smells. Just clean and classic and love the vitamins. My hair is thin, straight and fine, and this works quite well."
1173,NOW Foods Coq10 60mg with Omega-3,0/0,4.0,"What a nice product! Have used for years, feel great! A big plus is that this price beats all others!"
1174,"Luna Bars, 1.69-Ounce Bars",0/0,5.0,"You know the old saying ""If it tastes good it isn't good for you""? Well, this is the exception to the rule. I keep a couple in my purse all the time."
1175,Refresh Liquigel Lubricant Eye Drops 1 Fluid Ounce (2x15 ml),0/0,4.0,"Pros:A lot of eye lubricant products for nighttime would heavily blur the visions for a few hours. Liquid gel isn't as thick and barely affects vision, but it still lasts long enough for nighttime sleep and outdoor activities.Cons:It isn't as thick, so it doesn't work as well as thicker but blurrier nitghttime lubricant products. It's a trade-off I could take though.Other thoughts:So far it hasn't caused change of vision nor irritations after nearly 3yrs of usage."
1176,Dior Fahrenheit,0/4,1.0,"This perfume has a very strong smell that's described as refreshing, woody and mossy, the smell is unique but somewhat reminiscent of a mix of puke and sweat, perhaps is why many describe it as masculine.No matter what you think of it, this (as any exceptionally strong perfume) is absolute hell for anyone with a sharper sense of smell. So unless you are surrounded with people with a dulled sniffer, be considerate and don't use it in excess. Definitely not good for business situations (that call for a bit of subtlety) as it can backfire, quite badly."
1177,"Ambrosoli Honees Menthol Eucalyptus Cough Drops, 9-Drop Bars (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"These cough drops have more menthol in them than any other I have found. They soothe a sore throat, open up a stuffy head, and will help with minor asthma attacks. I won't go anywhere without them."
1178,Dana Heaven Sent Vanilla Eau de Parfum,0/0,4.0,"The fragrance is very nice, but not much vanilla. It's inoffensive enough for everyday wear and any occasion, though. Musky floral about sums it up. I'm glad I got the half-ounce sample, but would probably not rebuy."
1179,"Truform 20-30 Below Knee Open-Toe, Beige, XL",0/0,4.0,Got these for my Mom because she suffers from enlarged varicose veins...the quality of stockings in the stores were sub par compared to these..she's had it for awhile now and it still looks and feels brand new ..I could actually see a difference in the size of the veins on her legs...she wants me to order her another pair pretty soon ..so well worth the money
1180,Historic Lynchburg Tennessee Whiskey Steak & Burger Seasoning,0/0,5.0,I also like it on my Green Beans and hamburger helper. My Secret ingredient comes from this bottle. I am glad to see it here as the BBQ store I bought mine from stopped carrying it.
1181,GladRags The Keeper,0/0,5.0,"Just received my moon cup today and in time to actually use it. It's working great for me so far. I had read previous reviews about difficult insertion so I decided to do this in the shower, had no problems. I don't feel it when it is in. I did have to trim the stem to fit my body. Overall I believe this is a wonderful product and I hope it becomes more well known to the general female population. So long icky pads and tampons!"
1182,"Flying Machine Kit, 17"" Wingspan",1/1,1.0,"This is really poorly made. Within the first minute of use, the airplane landed on the ground and broke its flimsy tail. What a major disappointment for me and my son. This would not be good even if it was free."
1183,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,1/1,4.0,"We had one of the original Drinkwell fountains and the cats loved it. My big cat loved drinking from the stream. When the original developed a leak around the pump connection after 5 years of service, I replaced it with the larger capacity Platinum Pet Fountain. Pros"
1184,Chris Christensen Black ChrisStix,0/0,5.0,"If you apply it properly, and dry it properly, it won't smudge off. It is perfect for those LITTLE imperfections that need to be covered before going in the ring."
1185,Educational Insights Alphabet Bean Bags,0/0,3.0,"A great product, we have used them to play lots of games to consolidate the boys letter and sound learning. Only negative is they were a little smaller than i had expected...."
1186,"Stila Lip Glaze, 0.04 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"This has staying power! Not the revlon 8 hr type, just nice, thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way. I love the sheer intensity of the color, and Amazon has it for a great price. It also doesn't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice."
1187,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,5.0,"Got the product 2 days after I ordered and I used standard shipping!! Easy to put together and works great for 3 cat litter boxes and feed pans,(use this to keep dogs out,you know what I mean)"
1188,Rinse Ace 4058 Pet Bathing Tethers with 2 Straps,0/0,5.0,"Pros:1. Suction is very strong, once pressed against my tub's bottom I had a difficult time removing them.2. Holds my dog's head still and helps to prevent her from leaving the bathtub3. Straps have a solid construction feeling to themCons:1. Does not hold her rear in the tub(though not designed to do so) as such she will put half her body out of the tub if I am not watching.Other Thoughts:1. These should make bath time much easier if you have a dog that does not like bath time. Make sure to position them on the bottom of the tub, they have a very strong suction, but if placed on the sides will slide upwards freeing your dog."
1189,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Rover Remote Control Car,0/0,5.0,This thing is great. Good power. Long battery life. Tip
1190,Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap,0/0,4.0,I TRIED EVERYTHING!!!! Every over the counter cream you can imagine i tried for 2 months and could not get rid of the ringworm and kept getting more spots showing up. Looked around and based on the product reviews selected this product. It helps with medication that i was taking but i dont know by itself. That same day i was using this is also when i started on pill medication
1191,"amazing grace | perfumed shampoo, bath & shower gel | philosophy",2/2,3.0,"Before purchasing this item, I did read the earlier reviews so I cannot say I wasn't warned. I found it true that the fragrance, however lovely, did not last. I did find it lathered well, using my shower pouf. What I did not expect was the astringent quality of this product.After using this product daily for awhile, I found my skin becoming very dry and requiring additional application of lotion (which also killed this product's fragrance).I don't need to wash my hair every day but after a few applications, my hair began to frizz out, as it was very dry. I guess the ingredients label says it all, not much but chemicals in there."
1192,"Stila Lip Glaze, 0.04 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"This has staying power! Not the revlon 8 hr type, just nice, thickens to your likeness and just a bit goes a long way. I love the sheer intensity of the color, and Amazon has it for a great price. It also doesn't have that weird artificial flavor or smell that some glosses have which is always nice."
1193,FUJIYAM Cologne by Succes de Paris for Men - @ Up To 55% Off,1/1,5.0,"My wife bought this for her brother, she opened to make sure this is the right scent for him--not too strong and overpowering. Immediately, she loved the smell and decided to keep for HERSELF and buy another one for her brother. Not a cologne user, but I have to say this is a great fragrance for men even women who likes light perfume."
1194,"Merkur ""Futur"" Safety Razor, Satin Finish",0/1,1.0,"I recently purchased the Merkur Satin Finish Safety Razor. It is difficult to shave with as soon as the handle gets wet with water or soap. I have to constantly correct its position. Also, the handle feels very short in my grip which adds to this problem. If the handle were about an inch longeror even more and knurled somewhat, the task of shaving would be far more enjoyable. In the end, I will not recommend such an expensive razor to my friends unless these problems (in my view) are corrected."
1195,Simpsons Chess Set with Laminated Wood Board,0/0,5.0,"Box got a little wrinkled, but the contents of the status was great.Really nice!! I love it! Thank you so much!"
1196,Thera Tears Thera Tears Liquid Gel Lubricant Eye Single-Use Containers,0/0,5.0,"Thera Tears Liquid Gel has been the tears of my choice for years because it gives me relief from dryness that lasts longer than other tears. Also, I have not developed any allergic reaction to this product as I have to others. In 2001 I experienced Shingles in my cornea, after which my eyes were extremely dry. I experienced frequent scratched corneas, and my eyes always hurt. I was unable to use Restasis because my eyes were too dry. However, Thera Tears eventually provided enough lubrication so I could incorporate Restasis into my routine. I will not go anywhere without Thera Tears."
1197,"Coromega Omega-3 Supplement, Orange Flavor, Squeeze Packets, 90-Count Box",0/0,5.0,"The individual packets taste like orange cream and there is not much in them so you don't have to worry about eating a lot of it if you don't like the taste. I haven't gotten any fishy aftertaste, though I couldn't tell once if I tasted some fish or not but every other time it just taste like orange cream."
1198,Flexi Comfort 3 Large Retractable Tape Dog Leash - Blue w/Black,0/0,5.0,"I bought this item some time back and love it! I actually bought it to replace another one almost the same as this one. The other one had all the leash out and i couldn't get it to go back in anymore making it useless for me to restrict my dog from going far when i needed to. This one got here quickly and i was excited to see that the leash part is blue! As i love the color blue this is a plus. I was looking for something strong that could hold the weight of about a hundred pound dog as my dog is a bloodhound. Definitily this one does the trick. So amazon, two thumbs up for that! As i could not find this leash on any other site but yours."
1199,It's You Babe Prenatal Cradle Plus/V2 Supporter Combo,0/0,3.0,"Bought this during my second pregnancy for additional support. It worked overall to support my low baby, but was difficult to find shirts to cover it. It crosses like an x across your chest making it noticeable in everything but a turtleneck!! But helped for a long day at Disney."
1200,"Trewax Instant Wax Remover, 32-Ounce",0/0,1.0,"I had been searching for a product to remove the wax off of my tile floor and decided on this one based on the reviews. And guess what? It didn't work! I diluted it with water, just like it said do, and nothing happened. I tried it undiluted on a small area and it peeled up a little bit of wax in a spot no bigger than the palm of my hand. This product blows. If you want your floors cleaned like you want them, invest the money and call a place like Stanley Steemer. That's what I'm gonna do! I bet they can get the floor cleaned. Lol Chao baby. ;)"
1201,The Wet Brush,0/0,5.0,"Got this brush because both my 2 year old's hair and my hair were getting long enough to need a brush that could de-tangle. The brush works great for both of us. And my daughter likes the bright color (yellow in her case, and blue in mine). You don't get to pick the color, but that didn't matter to us, and nice that we got two so I could let my daughter pick. Now I can brush my hair in 1/3rd the time and with barely any pain. And my daughter likes having her hair brushed as well."
1202,Small World Toys Preschool (They Keep Multiplying!) 12,0/0,3.0,"To view answers you must press really HARD to see numbers. It's almost like to plastic buttons are too thick or need to be more translucent in order to view the numbers more clearly. Overall, the quality seems to be good."
1203,Burberry Touch For Men,0/0,5.0,I was a little hesitant to buy this perfume. But trust me it is great. My wife loves it and the female colleage asked which one is it to buy for her husband. :) It stays on till you wash the shirt. :)
1204,Barielle Nail Strengthener Cream Cuticle Care Products,1/1,5.0,"This product works great in keeping your nails from chipping and splitting and also keeps your cuticles soft and moisturized. I've been using Nail Strengthening Cream for several years, and my nails and cuticles are in better shape than before. I've tried using other nail strengtheners, but they don't work as well, so I always go back to Barielle's product."
1205,Fiber Formula Cat Treats 2.1-Ounce,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful product. When my vet recommended a high fiber, low fat diet, I searched for treats all my 4 cats would like. They all love these! I have since recommended them to other owners and these treats are an all around hit."
1206,"SinuFix Mist - For fast, natural sinus relief - 0.5 oz",1/1,5.0,"This year's allergies got so bad that my sinuses were completely stopped up - reverting to their closed, pre-surgical state. The few times I could breathe, I had severe runny nose. I tried all the OTC antihistamines, (resulting in weirdness, sleepiness or zilch). I tried all the ""natural"" sprays (xylitol, OLE, cayanne, and even horseradish!) Only the addictive, rebound-laden drug-store nasal sprays ""worked,"" but they make the problem even worse after a few days. (This is all on top of my reoccurring sinus infections that I resort to Olive Leaf Extract capsules for - usually after the fact).I reconsidered the homeopathic ideas that seemed to work long before, despite my subsequent skepticism. Between Sinufix, (and Sabadil for general Hay fever symptoms), my nose has done a complete 180! It has never been this good during allergy season - ever. Moreover, instead of 2-3 nasal rinses a day, I now feel NO need to rinse my sinuses. (I started with a neti pot, graduated to the ""hard stuff"" like power rinsers and huge syringes) And even when I would rinse, there was no improvement and nothing seemed to come out except water (and then the residual water inside would make breathing harder for hours afterward).Most amazingly, you actually CAN'T ""feel"" this stuff working! No stinging, no drying out, no weird sensations or smells. It's Fire and Forget. The nose just naturally relaxes and opens up after a short time.It's a miracle."
1207,Kong Zoom Groom For Cats,0/0,5.0,Our cat is a little standoffish but bring out the Zoom Groom and he'll make friends with anyone! The down side is that you could make a few kittens from all the fur it collects. The flat side gathers fur from cloth surfaces.Want a cuddlier cat? Try one of these brushes.
1208,"Max Factor MAXeye Shadows, 0.12-Ounce Packages",0/0,5.0,Love it! Great product -- really works to make skin smooth and flawless. Delivery was quick and product came in great condition. I highly recommend it.
1209,"Sezme Sesame Snaps, 40-gram, (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,Very pleased with the quality and tatste of this product will definitely reorder. Crunchy and sweet. Very good snack or energy boost
1210,"The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Love this bread mix and I've been using it for several years. In my option, it's the best gluten free bread mix on the market!"
1211,Synovial-Flex Soft Chews (240 COUNT),0/0,4.0,I liked the bulk purchase of this product. I am not sure if it helped the 13 year old Aussie shephards but it did provide extra nutrients. They made it to 14.5 and 15 years old. A friend swore by it so I had to try them.
1212,"Celestial Seasonings Ice Cool Brew Iced Tea, Peach, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I used to ration this item cause the supermarkets here do not sell this item. Anyway, I ordered this item and now I have an abundent supply of cool brew tea. It's great tasting and easy to make.This is a good buy."
1213,African Shea Butter Cream 100% Pure & Raw Gold 5 0z,0/0,5.0,I really love this product! It's a great moisturizer and so good for your skin! I love buying natural products so when i saw this and the price i definitely had to try it. It's so good for putting on your feet to make them nice and soft. I ended up buying another one for my mom which she loves! The smell doesn't bother me. It can be a bit greasy but its butter what do you expect.
1214,Ocean Wonders Seahorse Rattle,0/0,5.0,"I don't get it, I have no idea why she loves this rattle so much, but its one of her favorite toys. She's 8 months old, and she still loves it. Its a great bath toy too."
1215,Phillips Brush #11 * Metal Bristles With Red Cushion,3/3,5.0,"I had looked everywhere to replace this style brush ,but all I could find was ones with the little balls on tips.SO pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon !Fast delivery and exactly like the one I needed replaced.IT is a very durable quality.Best hair brush you could ever want."
1216,Marshall Premium Ferret Diet,0/0,1.0,High protein kitten food is the same as ferret food Read the labels just like the ferret litter that's made out of Recycled newspaper. Make your own decisions it's cheaper
1217,Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this item weeks before my due date because I felt like I would need something to help me track my baby's feedings. I'm so so so glad I did. I simply love this little timer. It has made my life so much easier. The different timers are not the only good thing about it. The nightlight function has worked wonders when my little baby asks for her milk during the night. I can feed her without turning the lights on so she can go back to sleep easily. Another thing, this product is incredibly resistant. I have dropped it to the floor like 5 times and it more still works. Of course, it suffered some damage, but it is still highly functional. I would recommend this to anyone who's about to have a baby. I never thought this thing would be so useful!"
1218,Prenatal Cradle Mini Cradle,0/0,5.0,"I am in my 6th month, 2nd pregnancy. Before I started using this maternity belt I used to get so tired in 2-3 hours of outing. I had to always keep one hand on my lower belly for support. Mother to a toddler, this belt is a blessing. Keeps me running through the day. Sometimes even making me forget that I am pregnant. Love it!! It is uncomfortable only when I lie down. But maybe its not meant to be put on while resting. Highly recommend this product"
1219,Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play Playard with Carry Bag,1/1,5.0,"We ordered this play yard for our daughter's 4 month-birthday.The order came in with Standard Free Super-Saver Shipping within one week.The play yard is very easy to assemble,attractive colors,great quality,comprehensive instructions,WONDERFUL designs on all four walls (including an unbreakable mirror),steady colorful and easy-to clean floor mat.What else could one dream of?We are 100% satisfied with this purcahse.Highly recommend!!!!"
1220,"Midwest Puppy Playpen w/ 1/2"" Grid 48L x 48W x 30H",1/1,5.0,"This is what you would consider to be a long-term review. I purchased my Midwest Puppy Playpen (48x48x30) over 35 years ago. I still have it and although finally showing some signs of age in the finish (it has been stored outside in a shed when not in use), it still functions as well as the day that I purchased it. It has been invaluable as it housed litters of puppies, new puppies to our home that needed housebreaking, kittens/cats that needed a safe place to acclimate themselves to a new household and pets that were ill and needed to be confined temporarily. I love the fact that the floor can be set at different levels, so that when puppies are small, they can be high up to allow them to be easily reached through the top, a real back saver! As they grow, the floor can be lowered and they can use the door. The pans underneath (mine are metal, I would actually prefer the plastic they now use) allow you to line them with paper or chuck sheets (the plastic lined sheets they use under patients in the hospital) to catch any waste so that you can even use it in carpeted areas without concern to your floor. This has been one of the best investments I ever made for the care of my pets and I would recommend it to anyone. Although somewhat pricey, it is one of the few items that I would say is truly worth every penny. One bit of advice, if you are going to use it for puppies, small dogs or cats, I would get the 1/2"" floor to accomodate small feet that might fall through the 1"" squares."
1221,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"While I am not a cat person (my husband came with one) this product seems to fit the bill; it allows my husband to keep his beloved cat and keep the cat box smell out of the house. It makes cleaning the cat box an easy process minus that gagging of a normal cat box. It rolls easily and the fence seems to work well to separate ""used"" and clean litter; then you just pull the little drawer out and dump it. We only have one cat and I'm not sure that it would work for more than one but for us it is the perfect item!"
1222,BVLGARI BLV NOTTE For Women By BVLGARI Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,"This is my favorite perfume! It's perfect in the summer and divine in the winter. A few extra sprays in the winter makes it last all night long. The scent is dark and sensual with base notes of irish, dark chocolate and vodka. YUM! I get compliments every single time I wear it."
1223,Savon de Marseille (Marseille Soap) with Pure Crushed Local Flowers from France,1/1,5.0,I bought it to use on my face. It's doesn't get all my makeup off right away but eventually my face is squeaky clean. The rose scent is amazing. I will buy again.
1224,One touch Ultra 100 Count,2/2,5.0,Thanks Amazon for having the One Touch Ultra Strips in Stock........I've been going on line for the last couple of years ordering test strips for my son. He has been a Diabetic since he was 18 and is now 49. We rec'd the strips within 3 days. That was wonderful!Wish everyone would start using your sight to order strips. Much cheaper than using a Pharmacy with insurance.Thank you Amazon
1225,Nutrex Niox,1/1,3.0,"This product didn't live up to my expectations.Being from nutrex, i expected the best. And being from Amazon, I expected the correct product to be in the picture (as of now they show Volu Gro).I feel something of a NO pump after taking this. Stamina goes up, strength goes up a little, and veins become slightly larger (nowhere near the advertised pictures of NYC subway maps sticking out of someone's arm).That being said, get the original Jack3d while you can (being pulled from market soon). It is much more potent NO pump and has other effects making it by far the best pre-workout I have ever used. (Jack3d micro is not the same as Jack3d fyi).Also taking 12 pills a day kinda sucks. They arent big but they taste a bit foul and its just a lot of pills. (looks super incriminating to take in public)Overall, glad I tried it. I use it before college rugby games where jack3d is banned, but other than that not worth the money. Stock up on Jack3d.Note for the future. This product mixed with a Cellucor or other pre-workout may combine to be almost as good as jack3d once that's gone."
1226,Purina Busy Bone ChewBone For Small and Medium Dogs,0/0,1.0,After giving my dog one of the bones she became very sick and threw up for an hour later that night. And continued to dry heave for 20-30 mins after that. Don't chance it!
1227,LeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set - Styles May Vary,0/0,5.0,My son has been using this product from roughly 10 months old. I used to supervise him during his play because he could fit the letters in his mouth. It was a great distraction when I was making dinner. He has always loved this toy and has been playing with it every day since then. He is now 18 months old and knows most of his letters by sight. He also knows the phonics of about half of the alphabet. I am amazed at this! I didn't know he was actually retaining any of the information from this toy but I guess I was wrong! I highly recommend this toy!
1228,Jax Jumbo Sequence Tube Game,0/0,5.0,This larger version of sequence is great to play with because the mat is so easily viewed. We play in a group of 6 and so the smaller boards are problematic. It comes in a large cardboard tube which might be difficult to store if your space is limited. We like the game because it is easy for all ages and the pace of the game allows for conversation and snacking!
1229,Schylling Little Helper Broom Set,2/2,1.0,"The broom handle is made of very cheap plastic. The handle arrived bent...looks like someone tried to bend it in half. The weird thing is that the box was undamaged! I'm not sure how it would have gotten bent during shipping. It makes me wonder if they sent it that way...which doesn't make sense, but I can't think of any other explanation. I will be looking for a better quality toy broom for my daughter. I can't imagine that it would last very long even if it did arrive unbroken."
1230,Educational Insights Classroom Jeopardy Extra Scoreboard and Remotes,0/0,5.0,your pictures are very misleading it show 3 board and 9 controls. that what i thought i was purchasing or i would not have bought it. to much money for one baord and 3 remotes.
1231,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,I was happy I guessed right on the size as fitting is crucial. The DVD was very helpful in fitting and handling the dog with this new collar and technique. My dog is a Doberman puppy- but a huge puppy and she pulls during our entire walk. The collar has definitely helped and I am enjoying our walks far more. I have her staying by my side most of the time and she only trips me a few times per walk- so this is definitely progress. Thank-you Gentle Leader.
1232,Avalon Organics Conditioner Awapuhi Mango Moisturizing,0/0,5.0,"This is the first conditioner I've ever used that did not weigh my hair down! I recommend this conditioner (and the Avalon Thickening Shampoo) to anyone with fine hair. I have alot of hair, but it's fine. I did not use conditioner for years because of the ""weighed down"" factor and decided to try Avalon Thickening Conditioner because my hair started to feel very dry. I like the Avalon Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner better than anything I've purchased at a salon! The only thing I'm afraid of is that whenever I find a product I like, it ends up being discontinued - hope this never happens with Avalon products!"
1233,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I have had this color on my toe-nails for weeks! It is the best Tiffany Blue I could find and I love it. I get tons of compliments and it hasn't even started to chip. I will need to re-apply it soon since it is growing out!
1234,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,5.0,My Wahl hair cutting kit works well and is easy to use. The instructions that accompany the set are clear and informative.
1235,Brussel's DT2101GMJ Green Mound Junpier Bonsai,1/1,4.0,"I was skeptical buying a tree online, but am pleased to say that my bonsai arrived in good health. The shipping was excellent, and the tree came securely enveloped in a nest of packing peanuts.As for the tree itself, I have christened him Mr.Miag-Tree, after that infamous sensei that introduced the world to these majestic miniature arbors. Sitting on my desk, it brings me peace, serenity, and balance and at times makes my humble cube feel like the ancient boreal forests of the Orient.This coniferous fellow is a source of extreme merriment and joy, a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak backdrop of masonry and anguish. So long as my juniper persists in this the harshest of environs, then so too can I."
1236,"Revolution Tea English Breakfast Black Tea, 16-Count Teabags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,This tea has a brightness and complexity to it that I have not tasted in other teas. I would encourage other tea lovers to purchase this tea.
1237,Duro-Med Adjustable Folding Cane with Carrying Case,0/0,5.0,"I just received this today and it took all of 10 seconds to put it together. It basically snapped itself into place. It was already on the lowest height setting so I didn't even have to adjust that (I am 5'4 1/2"" tall). Weight capacity for this cane is 300 lbs. (I didn't see this mentioned in the discription on Amazon or in the reviews I read). Hopefully, this helps me through PT for my broken ankle."
1238,Between Dental Gum Wintergreen 12 pieces,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this gum after an exhaustive search for sugar free gum that didn't contain aspartame, which is an additive that is bad for people with sensitive GI tracts (and may have other negative health consequences). Almost all gums contain aspartame and it's very difficult to find a product that doesn't.This gum met all the basic criteria I needed. I tried a few other brands that didn't contain aspartame includingGlee Gum Triple Berry, 18-Piece Boxes (Pack of 12)). Between was the best, primarily because the taste lasted and the gum doesn't harden after a few minutes of chewing. Granted, the flavor of this gum won't last as long as standard commercial gum found at the grocery store. But that's the tradeoff for purchasing a more healthy product.As a ""healthy"" gum product, Between gets 5 stars. Even as judged by commercial gum standards (flavor, longevity, etc.), this product would get 4 stars."
1239,Enzymatic Therapy L-Theanine,1/1,5.0,"I quit energy drinks in favor of taking l-theanine. For me, it helps with my mood and attention span and helps me to feel more alert without all the nasty side effects of lots and lots and lots of caffeine."
1240,"Nature's Answer Passionflower Standardized, 60-Count",16/17,5.0,"I have had a chaotic year and getting to sleep was difficult for me at times. I would sometimes take 3 or 4 Benadryl a night but after learning of Benadryl's anticholinergic properties, I decided to stop using it as my go to sleep aid. Since I'm at a serious university with a double major / double minor and preparing for graduate school, I cannot take chances on anything that could cause ""brain fog"" and felt really stupid having gone so long doing so.I read reviews on Passionflower and asked a holistic herbalist friend who works at a health food store about it. She said it was much better to use then OTC drugstore products. I bought it on Amazon and haven't looked back.It's really changed my life. I take two around 7pm to prepare for a 10pm sleep. It doesn't take long to start working. The hours leading to sleep are calm and focused. Usually I jet around or watch TV but with this, I find myself going a slower, even pace and preferring to read or chat with my friends. The effects I feel first are an overall calming and a peacefulness to my thoughts then my body. Almost an ethereal happiness that makes the idea of laying in bed and sleeping a soothing idea instead of a frustrating one.If I've had a ramped up kind of day, I'll sometimes add a Melatonin. Melatonin gives me headaches and nightmares though so I tend to avoid it.I have to be up at 4am for rowing practice on my school's team. If I would take Benadryl or Tylenol PM, getting out of bed for this was a nightmare and nearly impossible. With Passionflower, I wake up refreshed and alert, I am able to bounce right into practice and my day without feeling slow or tired.Also, I am dating someone whose mother had insomnia as well. I gave her two of these and she said they really helped sleep. She ended up getting some for herself and has been sleeping like a baby ever since."
1241,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,4/4,5.0,"Love the quality of this shearling coat, but we had to return it for a size smaller. According to the size chart the XXL fits Irish Setters, but the coat was huge on our Irish Setter-sized mutt. Here's hoping that the XL fits better. If it does, I'll return and give it 5 stars.A month later"
1242,Gundam MSN-04 Sazabi MG 1/100 Scale,0/0,4.0,"I recently finished this model, is the oldest MG I have put together (I believe it was released on 2000), and it shows.The completed model is huge, bigger even than the EX-S gundam, so if you want a smaller and newer model I highly recommend the 1/144 HGUCThe inner frame is on the simpler side, without much detail. This is specially bad on the funnel racks, without any detail on the inner surface. There is some more detail on the lower legs, cockpit and backpack, but nothing too brilliant.The articulation is a mixed bag, with policaps for joints. There are ball joints in the shoulders and hips, but the mobility is limited, specially on the hips, you can't get more than 20 degrees of abduction. Extension and flexion is limited because of the front and back skirts. But the knees are the biggest offenders, with less than 45 degrees of flexion. The neck is on a double joint , with a wide degree of motion. The elbows are also double jointed.The armor plates also are on the lacking side of details, without much panel lines. Still, this leaves a good margin for you to get creative with your paint job.There are a few gimmicks, such as the cockpit, the articulated monoeye, pistons on elbows and ankles and the funnels, which are fully articulated.The proportions are a little odd, but still accurate to the lineart. This also means that we get a smallish decal sheet and dry transfers.On the good side, we have a sturdy model and a fantastic design, although a little stiff.Well, that's it. With a new RX-93 ver Ka on the horizon, there is not to unreasonable to think there will be a sazabi ver 2.0, so I would recommend you yo wait for it."
1243,ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,1/1,3.0,"The first batch I got was fairly good, the second batch had a plastic sort of taste. I didn't realize how bad it was until I tried some side-by-side with some Taste Nirvana brand.So my recommendation so far is Taste Nirvana, I just ordered some Amy and Brian's I will update here once I get it and compare.Update:The Amy and Brians young coconut water/juice is really good. Expect something a bit different than you are used to as it is a young coconut water. Very sweet but not overpowering, needs to be drinken cold for best flavor."
1244,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,This was a trendy color this summer and I enjoyed it. The color is the same as it looks in the bottle after 2 coats.
1245,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I have had this color on my toe-nails for weeks! It is the best Tiffany Blue I could find and I love it. I get tons of compliments and it hasn't even started to chip. I will need to re-apply it soon since it is growing out!
1246,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,1/1,5.0,"I ordered this hair dye because I am pregnant and needed to touch up my hair before my sister's wedding. My hair is thick and chest length, and I purchased one box to do a partial highlight, and it was great for that. I probably would have needed 2-3 boxes for all over color. I was pleased with the results. My hair is light brown and was lightened to a honey blonde color (it says in the instructions that it will only lighten 2 shades from your natural/current color). My hair feels nice and soft, not fried like it would with a bleach product.I had my stylist apply it and she was impressed that it worked nicely and was made with natural ingredients. There was no nasty smell, but she did say the product's texture was a little strange. She suggested that if someone were looking for a brighter color like the one pictured, they should try a cool base (C) instead of a neutral base (N) like this product has."
1247,Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,0/0,5.0,I purchased this sling to carry my 4 month old granddaughter. She loves to snuggle in and it gives me an extra hand when shopping. It is so easy to use and easily adjustable for any size.
1248,"Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black",0/0,4.0,Allows me to sleep even when the lights are on. Thanks for making my sleep that much more comfortable! I will order again when this one wears out. Thanks again.
1249,"Lipton CupaSoup, 4 Count (Pack of 12)",0/0,1.0,"I was very disppointed with this soup, I have always used and enjoyed Lipton products but this soup has no taste. I would not order this product again."
1250,"Coralife Energy Savers ACL53106 double Aqualight power center, 48-Inch, 4x65w",0/0,5.0,Great product!It has nice power output for coral propagation in small tanks.Was able to install it inside a hood. Use of a fan would be recommended due to temperature.
1251,OPI Classics Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,This is a very neutral color and very much like a vintage color from 20 years ago called French Cognac. That's why I was very pleased to find it. It is a wonderful brown red and perfect for fall.
1252,"PetSafe In-Ground Deluxe Ultralight Collar with Radio Receiver, PUL-275",1/1,5.0,"The collar works just fine. I bought it for a St. Bernard and it's not strong enough for him. I'll have to buy the big dog collar, but it's a great back up for my pug. I knew I was taking a chance on the smaller collar. We had a St. Bernard years ago and it wasn't strong enough for him either."
1253,"BISSELL Swift Sweep Sweeper, 2201B",1/1,1.0,"This did not pick up anything we needed it to, except cat hair. It didn't even push the stuff around, just ran over it."
1254,Terra Sweet Potato Chips,0/2,1.0,"I got a great deal on these but it was clearly too good to be true. The taste is terrific -- very zingy but I had a strong negative allergic reaction to something in the chips. And that's where the mystery begins. Either it's the presence of canola oil (probably GMO) or some undocumented MSG -- or both. I would hope by now that the large corporate organic food companies would find a healthier oil and leave out anything that could cause health problems. I also have celiac disease so it may be some kind of wheat variant not listed on the package. Clearly this product could be a real winner but it only made me hyperventilate (even overnight), needlessly so. Maybe Terra should take a look at Kettle's old black bean tortilla chip recipe (which was phenomenal and so healthy) and then develop something along those lines. I would buy that in a nanosecond. The verdict? Savvy consumers should avoid this product -- I would recommend Plocky's chips instead!"
1255,Botan Rice Candy 0.75 Oz.,0/0,5.0,"The box is cute and well-printed, and the candies were delicious. They are wrapped in a thin rice paper, which tastes much like any rice paper (similar to the kind you can buy at the store for spring rolls). The centre is chewy and has a light lemon or orange flavouring to it. Included was a red-orange sticker with little clouds and a word in kanji."
1256,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,10/10,2.0,"These are fine batteries, and they work.However, they all have an expiration date of beginning of 2015. Not a big deal, but it's late 2012 now, and the package 'guarantees at least 5 years'. Clearly not the case, and they have clearly been sitting around the warehouse a while. Dusty package and all. Now again, they work fine, and the 'early' expiration date is not a problem for me, but I would certainly think twice about accepting these if I was to store for future purposes. These came from Amazon, not a 3rd party vendor."
1257,PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack),0/0,4.0,"Came right on time , fit like a glove and now the dog is a much happer fellow .No more calls from the neighbors Life is much better Thank you Ace"
1258,Crayola Color Wonder Markers and Paper,0/0,3.0,"I bought it for my toddler when we had to fly for 11 hours. It's great when you're in the small space you don't have to worry about staining anything other than the paper. At home, we found it better to use Crayola's washable crayons instead. You can easily wipe and erase when the child draws on tables or walls (maybe not fabric sofas). Because there's no delay in color appearance and it's a lot more cost efficient. But the wonder paper and pen is still great when visiting other people's houses, places or at parties when your toddler needs entertainment but dressed too well to stain."
1259,Flexrake Deluxe Carpet Scratch Post 1047,2/2,3.0,"I have two cats, and neither one use this scratching post much. they like it when I put catnip sprinkled around on it. That is the only time they pay attention to it!"
1260,"D&E Natural Bladder Care Solutions Supplement Capsules for Female Urinary Health System, Maximum Strength, 60 GlideCaps",2/2,5.0,"Besides these pills smelling awful and having a horrid taste (to me anyway) they work great! I used to take cranberry pills to help with urges, but now I take these and my pee isn't orange! Try them."
1261,Loreal Hair Fixer 6 applications,0/0,5.0,"I have dry, bleached, damaged hair. My hair is always frizzy because of my natural wave so I end up straightening it. This was the first product that I could put in my hair, let my hair air dry and the natural wave and curl in my hair looked great - not just friz. I love it!"
1262,Braun 5270 X'elle Body System Epilator,0/0,1.0,"I got this epilator almost 2 years ago, and I use it every so often to see if it'll magically work for me. Two years later, still no luck. I got it to use on my legs and I was so disappointed with the results. I followed the instructions exactly, but it still only broke the hairs instead of removing it completely from the root (I can tell because I can't see the rounded root of the hair it ripped out). I wasn't left with smooth results at all, even after doing it several days in a row. It really is painful, but you're ripping hair out, so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating. I just couldn't get this to work for me. It's a shame because it was extremely expensive.By the way, if anybody has any tips in case I'm somehow doing this wrong, please respond to this review. Again, this was really expensive and I hate to waste money."
1263,Mustela 2 in 1 Hair & Body Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"I've tried them all and still no one tops Mustela! It's gentle and only requires a small amount for a good lather, so to me you get more than your money's worth. The scent is amazing and Mustela is definitely the shampoo/wash that keeps its scent the longest. I gave my daughter a bath last night and I can still smell it in her hair! Mmm so lovely!"
1264,Vidal Sasson VS432 11/2 Inch Tangle-Free Hot Air Styler,0/0,5.0,I Love this Hot Air Styler! It doesn't tangle like other types I've tried. My order arrived promptly and in great condition. I would highly recommend this product!Vidal Sasson VS432 1 Inch Tangle-Free Hot Air Styler
1265,Sound Spa Portable,1/1,3.0,More like 2.5 stars due to tendency to break or poor quality materials/assembly. I purchased 3 of these for my acupuncture clinic. They work great for creating white noise and a sense of privacy for patients. One of these broke after I had it for less than 6 months. The knob has gotten wobbly which seems to make the sound is warlbled - sounds like a bad cell phone connection. Interestingly the one that broke is the one that I use least frequently.
1266,"Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream, SPF 15, 1.4 Ounce",0/0,5.0,I get super smooth and silky results from this anti wrinkle cream. I found it absorbs really quickly into the skin and is quite possibly the best moisturizer I have ever used.
1267,"First Aid Only All-purpose First Aid Kit, Soft Case, 299-Piece Kit",0/0,5.0,"This a well made first aid kit. I found that it had everything i needed for around the house first aide. While it lacks a few items for more serious wounds i have found that for common cuts and bruises it works fine. I have augmented the kit with a few thicker, more absorbent pads for bad cuts and a couple of hemostats. The tweezers and scissors that come with it lack some strenght and dexterity, but some items from your local superstore can bump this kit up significantly. I plan to buy another and stock on some items for more serious injuries. While not the best, it is a very good starting point and costs much less than buying the items individually."
1268,"Bruder Trash Bin Set (3 Small, 1 Big)",0/0,5.0,Simple toy was exactly what I needed :)I may order more as both my boys love garbage trucks and garbage cans.
1269,Active Green Bar,0/0,5.0,"The title of my review is an understatement. I limit myself to only one of these bars a day, but they taste fantastic and I never had anything like them before. I've been on exercise and weight loss routines in the past and had to eat other ""energy bars"" but these are really how they should all be. Moist and delicious. Wonderful!"
1270,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,1.0,This stethoscope is not Caribbean blue it is garden hose green no rainbow colors as described very very disappointing the wrong item was shipped to my home
1271,Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat,0/0,5.0,"I love this product! It works wonders. I made sure I tested it at 5 different restaurants before I posted this. It worked very well and does it's job to a T! Lets be honest, we all have messy kids, so the chances that they're not going to get one item on the floor is impossible. This product definitely minimizes the issue by 90%. I'm one of those moms who said that I'm not going to let my child make a horrible mess on the floor if we went out for dinner. Well, that's impossible too. I literally picked up 2 to 3 pieces of food off the floor versus 40 pieces of food from before. I'm very pleased with this product and when you're finished with it, you can just roll it up and take it home for cleaning. Will recommend this to others."
1272,Body Back Buddy & Mini-BBB Self Massage Tool Duo,1/1,5.0,"The Body Back Buddy is amazing. I can't function without it, in fact I take it with me when I travel as I use it almost every day. I have very bad knots and tightness in my upper back and shoulders and using the Back Buddy totally relieves the tension. It doesn't replace a therapeutic deep tissue massage but it helps me out tremendously between massages. I use it almost exclusively on the one area of my upper back that has issues but I find it does also work well in my neck and other areas of my back. I highly recommend this product."
1273,"Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives - Bodifying Foam With Pro-Thick Technology by Nioxin, 6.8 Ounce",1/1,3.0,"I was so excited to find this product. It has been very difficult for me to find it in any store or salon. It was fine at first but before the can was even remotely empty it was coming out like water and I could not use it. I was going to continue to buy from this seller, the same product, 2 at a time since I couldn't find it anywhere else, but I unfortunately had to change my mind."
1274,Neutrogena Triple Moisture,1/1,4.0,"This conditioner is very thick and creamy. It smells good too. I am African American, and I use it before (under my swim cap) and after swimming. It keeps my hair soft and shiny. It's also a good co-shampoo."
1275,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"I bought these diapers for my 6 month old daughter after using Swaddlers since she was born. The coupon was only for the Baby Dry and with a name like that, would you think anything else than a dry baby??? Guess again. These diapers are terrible. Of course I got the largest quantity too, 246 diapers, for $38.99. Boy I thought I was making out like a bandit! I changed my daughter tonight at 6:15 and it's 8:15 and she's soaked through to her clothes. And every single morning after sleeping a full 10 hours, she's got wet sheets and blankets. I cannot believe how disappointing this item is. I am shocked that Pampers even makes a diaper like this, when they have Swaddlers on the market. Please, if you are reading this before you switch over, DO NOT BUY THE BABY DRY. I am devastated that I am stuck with 200 more of these awful diapers."
1276,Aspen pet Cool Flow Pet Fountain,0/0,4.0,"At first this new addition to our house was not viewed as a friendly Monster. Our oldest at 13 hissed at it. With her I had to sit down next to it and play with the water until she decided it was safe because I am still alive. She started drinking from it and has abandoned her favorite water hole (the toilet) because this one has fresh running water. The other water dish we had out for her and changed on a regular basis did not provide cool water and was not appetizing.The youngest (3 months old) had an ""I will try to touch it and see if it bites"" approach. From 3 feet away her paw slowly reached out to tap it. Scoot closer... Reach... Scoot... run into the other room. she watched it for about 20 minutes when the older came up and drank from it. OMG what is this. Now she too has no problem drinking from the cooler.At first it was entertaining to watch them drink from it. Now it is just plain convienient. They get fresh water all the time, and I do not have to replace water 5 times a day.4 Stars for the value on this one. -1 star because of it's noise level is kinda high in the evening when nothing is going on.I would advise other cat owners to pick this up. Note I would not advise this for a dog larger than a cat as the amount of water it holds is only 108 ounces. which a lab can drink in 2 seconds."
1277,Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat,2/2,5.0,"This is an innovative, well constructed dog seat. I only wish it came in an even larger size. I have a Goldendoodle puppy, weighs about 20 lbs now but know at some point the Snoozer won't be large enough. My dog adjusted to it right away, especially when she gets to hang her head out the window.You'll need to purchase a harness. I tried two, one with the wide material around the chest and a simple, step in harness. I prefer the latter."
1278,Natural Calm Natural Vitality,0/0,5.0,I buy empty 00 capsules and make my own. The pre-made capsules I buy at the store are too large for my kids to swallow. This is an economical way to get magnesium.At Whole Foods this same product same size is $22! A bargain here on Amazon.
1279,Elegant Bronze Make up Mirror Strong 7x for Makeup,0/0,5.0,The mirror is elegant and perfect. Very good quality and I think if the magnification was any stronger the image would be distorted. I would not want it any stronger.
1280,Tape Worms Tabs for cats,1/1,5.0,"I was wary about using this product because it wasn't anywhere near natural, but after two months of trying natural remedies and nothing working I finally decided I'd just have to bite the bullet and get this and hope that it works. Well, as I said it's not natural, but it does work like a charm. I have quite a few cats and within 12 hours the worms were all gone. I chose to put the pills one half at a time into Greenies Pill Pockets and the cats gobbled them up, no fuss no muss. Highly recommended."
1281,Infantino Travel Gym,0/0,3.0,"The gym is cute, my daughter loves the toys that come with it - even though the monkey never worked for us.The mirror didn't get interesting 'til she realized she could pull it down and get her mouth on it.... yes, she can pull the whole thing over to get the toys into her mouth.THe single-bar design is much more flimsy than double bar models.We wash it fairly often - so I've gotten good at the set-up... and it's pretty easy to set up. but it just doesn't hold up.I'm also not sold on the extra PUFF to the monkey's head. It makes tummy-time difficult for a little baby who's still learning to hold her head up + forces a lilt to any position as she's older."
1282,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,0/0,5.0,"The Gillette Fusion cartridges give an excellent shave, and you're getting a pretty good price break by buying the 12 count package. All in all, a good deal on a great razor."
1283,Energizer Ultimate Lithium Batteries,0/0,5.0,I use these batteries in my SPOT Connect device as they are the recommended battery. I have the device mounted in a RAM cradle on my motorcycle and have used it for about a month now with no battery issues so far. Haven't had them long enough to determine longevity.
1284,Tones Onion Powder - 20 oz. container,1/3,1.0,"This onion powder when mixed with a small amount of water contains many small black specks that under magnification look like animal waste. None of the other onion powder I have looks like this. I will try to contact the mfgr but meanwhile, will not use or recommend. It could cause disease."
1285,Liquid Glass .5 oz. Laminate,0/0,5.0,"If you are looking for a durable nail topcoat polish, look no further. Liquid Glass Laminate is the best out there-anywhere! I have used countless other topcoat polishes andnone last as long or stay as shiny as ""Liquid Glass"". Not even so-called 'salon' topcoats last as long or look as good as 'Liquid Glass'. I clean houses for a living and my hands are in chemicals and water all day long but my manicure looks good for weeks. I strongly suggest you try this product ""Liquid Glass Laminate"". long lasting, reasonably priced, with beautiful results."
1286,Vittles Vault Stackable Container Holds,0/0,5.0,We have 3 of these Vittle Vaults and all three of them are excellent. They keep our dogs food fresh. I would one hundred percent recommend this product to a friend.
1287,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,0/0,4.0,"I have been using this product for 3 years, though I don't use it every day, only on special occasions where I expect to be photographed.I recommend against using this concealer every day though, there was a time when I used this concealer every day and my scalp became irritated because of it, but the irritation stopped when I reduced my usage.There's not much to say though. The product does its job as described. It effectively conceals any bald spot that you have but you won't be able to benefit from this if you don't have any hair at all."
1288,Probios Dispersable Powder,0/0,5.0,I was using Forta Flora at over $17 for a 30 day supply. But I decided to try ProBios and was surprised that I could save money and this brand works as well if not better! So glad I gave it a try!
1289,"Glucerna Meal Bar for People with Diabetes, Chocolate Chunk, 4-Count Boxes, 2.04-Ounces Bars (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"I have had diabetes for 30 years. Sometimes I need a quick snack when I am working, on the street or I don't have time to stop in a caffe or store to buy it. Or I can't take lunch box to carry food. So those Bars are an ideal option to have a snack. Delicious and practical. You don't need too much space and get the carbs you just need. I can find milkshake powder or milkshake cans in my country. But sometimes those beverages are hot when you are going to drink it.So this bars are a VERY good option for people like me. The delivery was on time and the packages were in perfect condition"
1290,Educational Insight's PLAY FOAM,0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my neighbor son's birthday. Kids loved it, played with it for hours. Definitely will buy it again."
1291,Maybelline Expert Eyes 100% Oil Free Eye Make-Up Remover - 2.3 fl oz,0/0,5.0,"I have spent many years and a lot of money on eye make-up removers, and I consistently come back to this product. It works on eyes and lips, and is not greasy (YUCK!) or irritating. One tip that I will share is to use the cotton squares or rounds instead of cotton balls and hold it against your eyes for a few seconds before wiping the make-up off. This is a great product for a great price."
1292,"ChuckIt! Medium Ultra Balls 2.5-Inch, 2-Pack",0/0,5.0,My 7 month pitt goes through tennis balls like its nothing. My pup lovessss playing with the ChuckIt and it has lasted way longer than any of his tennis balls. Definitely worth buying.
1293,"Clif Shot Bloks Organic Energy Chews, 2.1-Ounce Packets",0/0,5.0,"Tropical Punch is a new Clif Shot Bloks flavor, and personally, it's my favorite. The orange/lemon/lime type flavors are always too artificial and while Tropical Punch isn't 100% natural flavor, it's just the right blend of berries to be yummy w/out bitterness. I like the gummyness of this Blok, it's harder than other blocks, but in my option not too tough to chew while biking or running. I also don't need a lot of water to get this fuel down (compared to gus).I like the large box b/c this gets the price per pack down to around $1-1.50 range, much less than what you'll be paying in a bike/run shop."
1294,"Avalon Organics, Lavender Exfoliating Scrub 4 Ounces",0/0,5.0,I love this facial cream and I can't buy it in town anymore. The service was great from this company too!
1295,Natural Balance Happy Camper,0/0,5.0,"I have noticed that Happy Camper seems to be helping by keeping me in the moment without my needing to focus with any kind of strain. Pretty big effect with a very little price!Natural Balance Happy Camper, 120-Vegetarian Capsules"
1296,Foille Foille Medicated First Aid Ointment,0/0,5.0,"My household has been using this product for over 50 years. Although it is increasingly getting more difficult to find, it is still a GREAT value (for what it does) through Amazon. It is unmatched by any rival products (in my humble opinion) for use where burns are concerned and is excellent as an antiseptic and particularly where pain/itching relief is concerned.Over the years, I would get (on occasions) grease burns on my arms and hands (from being in the kitchen), and after washing and cleaning the area would put a nice 'lather' of this stuff on some gauze and cover it up, and left the gauze on the wound over several days. When it came time to take it off, I found that the skin had healed underneath! (I want to emphasize that I am talking about ""minor"" burns here.) My cousin, who was a welder, used to use this Foille Ointment any time he got a 'minor' burn, and like me continues to swear by it. I hope that the manufacturer does not stop making this product. It's really worth every penny!PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONFoille Medicated First-Aid Ointment TubeSize"
1297,"Jerdon JP2027N 8-Inch Two-Sided Swivel Wall Mount Mirror with 7x Magnification, 20-Inch Extension, Nickel Finish",0/0,5.0,The mirror was packed very well and arrived in perfect shape. It was easy to install and easy to use. It has been the perfect mirror to use for close up.
1298,Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I love these pads. It's the only brand I use. My puppy (with proper crate training) always knows to use the bathroom on these pads now. It only took about 2 weeks for him to understand to eliminate on the pad. I thought maybe it wasn't the pad, but the location of the pad, but when I took him to friends' homes, he immediately knew where to go. The only downside would be a bad smell that comes off of it after it's been soaked with urine. It's not a urine smell, but probably the scent that's built into the pad itself. If you have a trash can that has a lid, then you're fine. Does not leak. I only need one pad for my 5lbs puppy. Larger dogs may need multiple pads laid down as it's not that big."
1299,Ambi Fade Soap Black 3.5 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I admit I'm a little biased, because I love shea butter generally, but I thought that Ambi shea butter is really good since I've been using it for about 3 weeks and most of my dark spots are gone and my face has seriously cleared up a lot."
1300,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I love this polish....got in a timely manner and just as I ordered! I had my toenails done in a salon and had pink dots on this perfect shade of brown.
1301,Twining English Breakfast Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,Love this tea...drink it every morning! I alternate throughout the day between several others. My plan makes for enjoyable tea experiences.
1302,BbSounds Angelcare Movement Sensor w. Sound Monitor w. Two Parents' Units,0/0,5.0,"I thought it's time to write a review for this monitor. I got it with my first child three years ago. I now have my second child and love the peace of mind it brings us. Both of my boys were belly sleepers. This monitor would allow me to put them in their crib on their bellies without worrying about burying their faces. Yesterday morning the alarm went off. Before I got in the room the alarm turned off. I checked the baby (11 weeks old) and he was breathing and he his head was turned to the side so I could see he had plenty of air. The only thing I can think that happened was he stopped breathing long enough to trigger the alarm and the beeping was enough to startle him to start breathing again. This monitor is worth the price for any parent. Even when the baby wiggles his way up to the top of the crib, the monitor can still pick up his light breathing.I wouldn't plan on it being your only type of monitor. The parent units get too much static. We quickly stopped using those with my first child and only turn on the base when the baby is in his crib. Also, it doesn't work well if you have an incline in the crib. When our first child began to sleep in his crib we had him on an incline. The monitor couldn't pick up his light breathing with both the matress and his incline and would falsely go off.I also have a video monitor that i can view on my phone. Between these two monitors I have so much peace of mind."
1303,Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder,0/1,5.0,This powder is a great alternative to the expensive stuff that is in the post workout mixes. I did not want to buy something expensive from the local health store or even REI. I decided to find out what was in the expensive shake mixes and just make my own. I have seen much improvements in my size and volume at the gym. Others have noticeed too. This alone will not do the trick but it is essential in building muscle.
1304,"Vertical Wood Slat Gate, 53""-96"" W, 24"" H",0/0,5.0,the gate was just what we were looking for and the company was promp and took care of us very well!
1305,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey,1/1,4.0,"I had previously ordered the ON 100%% Whey Gold Standard 5 lb in 'Vanilla Ice Cream' flavor and loved it. Tasted fantastic (if you're into vanilla like myself.) This time around, that same flavor was not available, so I tried the 'Natural Whey, Vanilla'. It's good and the product is high quality, but it's not as tasty as the other one. If you're looking for a good, high-protein content powder, this is the right thing - just choose your flavor."
1306,COLD PACK MED SINUS MASK 10160,0/0,1.0,"I get bad headaches and I thought this item would be helpful, but it was a waste of money! When I take it out of the freezer, it is ice cold...too cold to apply to my eyes. I have to wait about 10 mins before I can apply it to my face. After being on my face for about 15 mins or so, the coldness goes away. So pretty much it stays cold for approximately 1/2 hour...going from extreme cold to not very cold. I would not buy this product again. If it wasn't for the fact that I would probably have to pay s&h just to return it, I would have done it in a heart beat!!!"
1307,Soft 'N Style Fine Mist Spray Bottle 8 oz. (Pack of 6),0/0,4.0,"I use this bottle for my homeade hair mists. They will sometimes contain oil, conditioner, water, aloe vera juice, or even shea butter. This bottle is very strong the nozzle does not get clogged even with thick liquids. I love the size of the bottle as it is easy to store on the countertop or in the cabinet. The lever is big enough so that my busy 1 year old can't inadvertantly spray everything if she gets her hands on it.The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the variability of the flow is not pronounced enough. At the lowest setting, a mist does come out but it is still a very strong mist. And, at the highest setting, the stream is extremely forceful. So, for me, it still works because the lowest mist setting does exactly what I need it to do with the thicker scalp moisturizers I use. However, lighter mixes do not come out in a fine, light mist with this bottle.I would recommend if for anyone who mixes liquids at home. It is reliable and has a great price point."
1308,Omron HEM 629 Auto Inflate Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,0/0,5.0,"I was trying to find a pediatric sized wrist BP cuff, but could not find one anywhere, so I bought this one and it works fine so far. And if a kid's wrist is just too small, I take it on their leg near the ankle, seems to work well that way too."
1309,"Diamond Dog Biscuits, Golden",0/0,4.0,"I love Diamond brand foods, and was reccomended to use them by my vet when my dog developed allergies to preservatives/food colors. I thought the Biscuits would follow the same standards. I was disappointed to open them and find a rainbow of colored biscuits. I try to give the bright red ones to the dog that is not allergic. The dogs like them well enough. They were a good deal, and if you buy colored treats, you'd probably give them 5 stars."
1310,Safari Flea Comb with a Double Row of Teeth,0/0,4.0,I have large hands and this fit well in them. This comb really captures the fleas well. It is comfortable to use. What is nice is that it captures the fleas so quickly that you don't have to go over your pet several times over. It also does a good job removing flea eggs and waste. I would suggest you keep a moist towel next to you to clean the comb as it will get full easily. The only complaint I have is that matter that gets stuck between the two rows of teeth can be a little challenging to remove. A toothpick or something narrow like that works well to remove the matter. It really isn't that difficult to deal with. I love this comb it really does a efficient job.
1311,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,2.0,I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now. Before I could not decide between the baby dry size 5 and the cruisers size 5 because I really didn't know what the difference was and now I do! The fit!
1312,"20"" RC Boat Navy Battle Ship HT-2877 (Color May Vary)",1/1,5.0,Nephew loves and is learning the finite controls with ease. A++Boat battery life is long lasting and takes a reasonable amount of time to charge.
1313,Pure Instinct,0/0,5.0,Same product as at the toy partys but for a better price !Stocked up on this insteas of buying at a toy party
1314,"Oxo Good Grips Upright Broom and Dustpan Set, Silver",0/0,5.0,"My daughter asked that I send a little broom to my grandson for his birthday, since he is always taking the big broom and trying to sweep. The minute the box was opened, he grinned, took the broom, and started sweeping!"
1315,Remington NEDH-2500 Titanium Personal Trimmer for Men and Women (Nose & Ear Trimmer),0/0,4.0,"I purchased my Remington NEDH-2500 Titanium Personal Trimmer at Walgreen's and have used it for almost two years. I've had no problem with it trimming nose hair sufficiently, but it is a little difficult to cut those just inside the base of the nose without doing some simple contortionist feats. This is the only trimmer of this sort I've ever used. I only use it for trimming nose hair, so I can't compare it against other brands or rate it for any uses other than that purpose. I've never been nicked while using the trimmer and it works well with fresh or recharged batteries. It uses a single AA cell battery. The trimmer has a single switch that slides on/off with only one speed. It's easy to clean, just remove and rinse off the cutter head under hot running water and you're done. The package includes the trimmer, ear hair cutter head and a clear cutter cap. This is a nice and inexpensive trimmer.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1316,Jason Body Care Satin Shower Body Wash,1/1,2.0,"This body wash has a really faint, almost non-existent Tea Tree scent. I own a hand soap by Jason and it is scented just right, smells great and the scent is very potent.The bodywash lathers well, like all Jason products and has a smooth feel to it, but it almost feels unscented in its neutral representation of Tea Tree.If you were using it, you would not even know that is not unscented. So if you are looking for tea tree oil minty scent and, perhaps, anti-fungal effects, look somewhere else. This bodywash fails to deliver the promised kick."
1317,Perry Ellis Reserve By Perry Ellis For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my brother as a gift, its smells so good, when u have it on and u walk the scent just travels with u were ever u go. Its really nice, a very lovely scent."
1318,Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper,0/0,5.0,Oster 76 was just what I hoped it would be. Cuts great and is quieter than noted in the description. I wish it would have come with more attachments as I had to reorder a 1 1/2 blade. Other than that I'm very happy wiht my purchase.
1319,Cellulean 6 Oz Reduce Fat And Cellulite Firm Skin,0/0,1.0,"It causes a coating on your skin that peals off, I don't see where it is helping. I used it daily. I would not buy it again.Cellulean (6 oz.) Anti-Cellulite Treatment"
1320,Masada Dead Sea Mineral Bath Salt,0/0,4.0,"I'm not certain if this stuff actually does what it claims to do, stuff like clear up your skin or relieve pain. All I can say for sure is that it feels very nice to soak in a tub with this stuff. If nothing else, it helps to calm me down after a long day. Worth trying IMHO."
1321,4M Volcano Making Kit,1/1,4.0,This is a fun project to make with kids. It is really simple and doesn't require alot of time. It is durable and you can explode the volcano as many times as you want. Clean up is easy just rinse off the volcano. Best if used as an outdoor activity since the vinegar smells bad and it makes a mess.
1322,Hot Wheels Superman Returns&#8482; Transporter,0/0,5.0,I ordered this Hot Wheels Superman Returns Transporter to be used for a gift. It arrived in very good condition and was described very well when I purchased it.I was very happy with the seller and also the way that it was packaged for delivery.
1323,Kids Earplane Ear Plugs For Airplane Travel,0/0,1.0,Maybe these would work better for bigger kids. I flew with my 2 year old and 5 year old from Boston to New Zealand and thought these could help as after awhile the engine noise is just too much. They did not fit comfortably in the kids' ears and they didn't stay at all. My kids couldn't stand them.
1324,Doggles Dog Harness Dress with Jean Fringe,0/0,5.0,This was my favorite and first article of clothing that I bought my little Chi girly girl. She grew out of it. It was made beautifully and I have plans on ordering another one a little larger. Everyone loved her little blue jean skirt! Too cute!
1325,JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,2/2,5.0,"This item was EXACTLY as described. My friend had one of these all purpose blankets. When I saw hers, I had to know where she had gotten hers. Every time the family and I went on an outing, I always wished I had brought something to sit on and not just a traditional blanket, but something sturdier and waterproof. This is it!!!I have to write, I was a little nervous after having read some of the reviews. I think that the J.J. Cole company really cares about their product and their consumers because all of the issues that had people had written about were none issues. This product did not smell like a petroleum product at all. I have one of the most sensitive noses around. I can't handle the smell of perfumes or non-natural based cleaning products. I'm telling you not a problem. I stuck my nose all over this product! Lol. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I couldn't smell anything. I also have a seven month old baby, so I was concerned about him crawling on something that could be toxic. Again, non-issue. Didn't have to wash it or air it out.The strap. Sewn on well. Hasn't broken yet. We shall see how that pans out. Also, there is an outer pocket. Would be nice if it had a flap on it to keep things from, potentially, falling out. This hasn't happened to me, but I could see if you were swinging it around where small things could fall out. It is a rather deep pocket that would fit several diapers and a small travel case of wipes without a problem. Of course, once you got to where you were going you would need to take items out to flatten the blanket out anyway. The pocket is strictly to hold a few things until you get where you are going.Velcro closure, yes, stuff could get stuck in it if you weren't careful about unfolding. There is a way that the Velcro folds up against the material so that debris, leaves, etc., doesn't get all stuck. Also, do be careful, if you are wearing something delicate like silk, the Velcro could stick and snag delicate clothing. I had on a casual silk sweater and when I was trying to fold it up, I had to be very careful not to snag it, but it could snag up a swimsuit when trying to fold it up. This DID NOT occur when I was sitting on it, as the Velcro is underneath the mat.Color of mat, mine was called grey and red. This is referring to the color of the trim and the exterior material, not the interior pattern. So, if you order gray/green, it means the exterior is gray and the trim is green. I was a bit surprised that other reviewers hadn't figured that out.Size is roomy. Five foot by five foot. Perfect to sit on or eat a picnic on. Yes, if you are trying to seat a small village you will need two or more. I actually have a small village, myself, hubby, and four kids, and we were fine. I kept reading how people think it's too small, not to be rude, but I think they might just have more girth than others. It's plenty roomy for trimmer people. I wasn't sure how else to word that in a politically correct fashion. Please don't shoot the messenger.Overall, love my product!!! Was exactly what I had been looking for."
1326,DaVinci Alpha Toddler Bed Conversion Kit,0/0,2.0,"this bed rail cannot be attached to a regular bed. it was not made clear when purchased that it is some type of rail that has to be nailed in or screwed in. nothing was included with it to show you how to do it plus there was not anything to let you attach it.! very misleading, i returned it"
1327,"Max Factor MAXeye Shadows, 0.12-Ounce Packages",0/0,5.0,"After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per friend's recommendation. I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help. This totally changed my outlook on shaving. My neck especially would be the worst. I dab it on immediately after I rinse and dry, post-shave. It does burn a bit but that goes away pretty quickly.Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore. I only apply it once after shaving even though the directions recommend repeat applications the following day.Go ahead and purchase, you won't be disappointed!"
1328,"Glad Handle Tie Tall Kitchen Bags, White, 13 Gallon, 50-Count Bags, (Pack of 4)",1/1,5.0,"I think I've tried every ""self-close-and-tie"" bag on the market, and in my opinion, these are the best.They're extra sturdy -- it takes a LOT of force or super sharp pointy things to poke a hole in one of these.They fit my kitchen trash can perfectly. My can is rated for use with 13-gallon bags, but some of the drawstring ones don't fit the circumference -- they're just a bit too small. These fit beautifully with a nice ""overhang"".They tie easily and do a good job of closing the bag, plus you get a carry handle with no worries of a broken draw string.I have these on subscription. No more shopping around!"
1329,Goldwell Topchic Professional Hair Color - 116 colors,0/3,1.0,"This hair color washes off like shampoo. For weeks the color ""runs"" when washing. It left my hair brittle and hard to comb without using industrial strength conditioner. I have used other hair coloring for many years and was never compelled to write a review but i want to let others know not to get this horrible product."
1330,betty - Color for the Hair Down There!,0/0,5.0,The product works and the results are good as last for a good amount of time. I will definitely continue to buy it.
1331,Corticool 1% Hydrocortisone Anti Itch Gel - 1.5 OZ,0/0,5.0,"Product worked as advertised. Corticool is not a product that linges is absorbed and leaves no residue, but, makes the itch go away"
1332,Berman Center Athena Waterproof Mini Massager,0/0,5.0,"Only has one setting, but it's a great one. Very powerful, deep vibrations. Comes with attachable heads, easy to clean depending on the head. Only takes 1 AA battery and lasts awhile.Would recommend, especially for the price! Makes a great couples toy because it's not so bulky."
1333,"Innotek Automatic No-Bark Dog Collar, BC-50B.",0/0,1.0,We bought this collar with high hopes but those quickly went away. Our dog kept barking and after a little while we realized that it never actually worked! Just returned it this week. Easy return though!
1334,Hugo Boss Hugo,0/0,5.0,What is pictured isn't exactly how it looks when you receive it (I believe a previous buyer uploaded a picture of what it actually looks like); but it is the Hugo by Hugo Boss. So what I received was exactly what I wanted; and I found this large bottle cheaper here on Amazon then the other websites I visited.
1335,"Nueva Cocina Beef Seasoning, Chipotle Taco, 1.25-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)",0/0,2.0,I guess I like a more common taco seasoning taste. This one doesn't get it for me but I like their other products.
1336,Braun Series 5 (8985) Men's Shaver,0/0,5.0,"I have used this man's shaver for the last 10 years & it works as good as it was from the first day I purchased it. Using the power cord to charge the shaver when travelling is a great help, rather than charging it from the main cleaning block. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in using this Shaver, especially when travelling.An excellent buy. Lionel."
1337,"Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen, 3 Ounce",4/4,4.0,"My wife gave this to me before a kayaking trip in Hawai'i. Extremely pale, I fit a stereotype of those who never venture into the sun. But, I had to go on this adventure, and I needed extreme tropical protection.I applied it generously to legs, feet, face and neck. I did wear a solar-weave hat of 30 SPF and a long shirt as well. Still, I feared getting burned, as previous lotions in the 35 or 50 range had failed, either due to my incompetence or my complexion.This one worked. I applied it twice, once before initial exposure and then, after getting wet, another time for the return portion of the river trip and the intense mid-day sun and extended water contact. However, it stung my eyes considerably the first application, as I never seem to get the knack of it avoiding my eyelashes.It is creamy and smooth. While it does not glide on as delicately as other lotions, perhaps its layer of protection as rated demands a different formula. I used up a lot--about half the bottle--but it was worth it."
1338,"Rockstar Energy Drink, 16 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)",1/1,5.0,"I love Rockstar energy drink. Even though it has hardly any calories, it does not taste like it is artificially sweetened. It gives me a nice afternoon pick-me-up and I love the fruity taste. The drink is augmented with ginseng, guarana, B vitamins, and other good stuff. While it's probably not the healthiest drink on the market, I love the taste. I'm one of those people who can't drink water and need to find other sources for hydration especially since I live in Florida where it's very hot. Rockstar and Blackberry Ice are my drinks of choice."
1339,Ravensburger Tropical - 1000 Piece Puzzle,1/1,5.0,"As soon as I opened the box and touched a piece I knew that the pieces were so much thicker than other brand puzzles. While sorting I did not even have to keep looking at different angles to determine shades, when they say no glare they mean it and what a difference this makes. I will not buy any other brand from now on. The other brands recently purchased had so many pieces identical in size and color that you had to constantly take them apart and figure out what went wrong, this puzzle does not."
1340,Pumie Toilet Bowl Ring Remover #TBR-6,1/1,5.0,"We have well water that was leaving a pinkish-brown stain around the water line of the toilet, and some blue streaks as well. I tried EVERYTHING to remove them, including ZUD, CLR (Calcium-Lime Remover), bleach - even oven cleaner (lye), nothing worked. But 5 minutes of fairly gentle scrubbing with this pumice stick did the trick and the toilets now look brand new."
1341,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,4.0,My 2 yorkies loved these. They would steal them from each other and it was quite entertaining to watch them. I would buy again.
1342,Plush Cat House with Cats - Five (5) Stuffed Animal Cats in Play Kitten House Carrying Case,3/3,3.0,"This is all my daughter wanted for her birthday. She loves the house and each little kitten and often tells me just how cute the cats are. Overall I'm not so impressed with the quality of the cats, and why would you make a cat house with 5 cats but only have 4 holes for them (I'm not sure why the picture shows 5 holes)?"
1343,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"Even though they don't leak, I hate the fact that the baby smells poop all the time. The diaper gets wet and then the baby and all his clothes smell terrible. Also I don't like them because they do not seem as natural on the baby's skin as the Huggies. Huggies are for sure a better option! I will never buy them again!"
1344,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"Our son just loves this turtle. He is 2 1/2 yrs.and still in his crib. He has it in there and knows how to turn it on himself. His big boy bed is soon to arrive and we will have it on his night stand or in bed with him! Perfect amount of light, it covers the entire ceiling! And it shuts itself off after 45 mins. We are very please with this turtle!"
1345,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"Tastes great with unsweetened almond milk! Love it in the morning before work or after the gym. Great taste, dissolves completely- smooth malty flavor, not too chocolate, just right!"

1348,"KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Toy",2/2,3.0,"My results with this 'brush' is that it moves fur around much as if massaging by hand. What hair does stick to the brush is difficult to remove, as it's sort of stuck on the material. During baths, it seems my hand does a better job of massaging the shampoo in, and the hair that comes off the dog gets stuck in the drain strainer rather than on the brush where it's a pain to remove. Was hoping it would at least have some effect on my little terrier, but it seems I get more loose fur by just rubbing my hands around and then brushing.UPDATE"
1349,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,"This is the only flea medicine that works. End of story. I was worried buying this product through amazon instead of from a pet store, but its the real product- not a fake. Yay! I saved myself 30 bucks!"
1350,StarMark Clicker Dog Training System,0/0,5.0,"I have used the StarMark Clicker for several years and I love it!It is not loud like the box metal clickers. I attach the clicker to a wrist band with a rubber band, so it hangs just right for me to access it quickly. I like the shape of the clicker; it fits comfortably in my hand.I always like to keep a few on hand to give to other training enthusiasts!I have 3 dogs and they love to see me get the clicker out. This means they get to ""work"" and clicker training makes learning fun!"
1351,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,1.0,I love China Glaze's nail polishes but this one is terrible. I bought it because it is a very unique color and thought it would look great for summer. It took 5 coats for it to actually be seen on my nails but it was still extremely streaky. It also looked very dry and matte even after applying a top coat. I immediatley took it off and threw it away. It's horrible. Do not waste you money.
1352,Joop! Joop Homme EDT Perfume Spray,0/2,1.0,"The cologne that I recieved appeared at first visually as the ""REAL"" thing, but it didn't have the ""REAL"" scent when sprayed on your body. I've owned the ""REAL"" Joop! before & people smell it when applied to your body...this didn't have that effect. It was also watered down. When I sprayed it on the bottom palm of my hand, it ran off like water. I'm pissed!!! I would like to get a refund!!!"
1353,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,So easy to use. No measuring just open the bag and dump everything in. The combination of all the ingredients makes this popcorn so delicious.
1354,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Poor Lil' Rich Girl,0/0,4.0,A nice light creamy clear coat. I work as a waitress so having chip free nails is almost impossible! So I love to wear something shear that doesn't show wear and tear too much. Overall a great color.

1356,Calvin Klein OBSESSION,1/1,5.0,I have worn Obsession Eau De Parfum for many many years. I always receive compliments when wearing this parfum. I feel the quality of the parfum has not changed over the years. I have always depended on this product and it has not let me down.
1357,Zoo Med Foam Block for 501 Turtle Filter,0/0,5.0,foam block for 501 turtle filter! what can you say about filter products?Work or don't! this one works! have tried other filters to no use!
1358,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,0/0,5.0,"My son played with this toy when he was 6 months to 1 1/2 years old. It was fun. He got a boo-boo from it once because it fell on him or he fell on it (I forget). The toy is not soft so if it falls on your kid there will be a wee bit boo-boo but nothing major, well worth the risk/reward gratification. In terms of durability, after a year, one of the sides (or two stopped working) but for this price and expected interested from the child, it is still well worth purchasing. I would get another one for my next son/daughter."
1359,The Art of Shaving The Art of Shaving After-Shave Balm - Unscented - 3.4 fl oz,0/1,3.0,"I've been shaving with a double edged (DE) razor for around 3 years now. I have had many shaving creams and aftershave balms. I used The Art of Shaving Lavender scented balm when I first started out. It was great then, but, after using superior products such asTruefitt & Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm, Castle Forbes Lime aftershave balm, and Truefitt and Hill Ultimate Comfort aftershave balm, I now know there is no equal match. Don't get me wrong, The Art of Shaving makes a great balm, but, it still leaves me with slight razor burn after 3 passes and using aFeather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ctloaded in anEdwin Jagger Double Edge (DE) Safety Razor - Lined Chrome Handle. I even put on much more balm than you're supposed to and I still had razor burn.I would recommend this cream if you do not have ultra sensitive skin like mine, or, if you are just starting out. I have since gave my slightly used bottle away and have went back to the Kings of shaving products"
1360,Enzymatic Therapy Remifemin,1/1,5.0,I love this product. I feel like I can sleep better and the hot flashes are definitely reduced after taking this for a week! I recommend you give it a try. I also purchased the regular remifemin and I also feel like that has made a difference in the number and intensity of the hot flashes!
1361,10051 Block Kits Bulk (10),0/0,5.0,"This is a great kit. It has all the pieces you need to build 10 cars.All parts were new, and wrapped really well.I used this for a company function and worked great."

1363,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,5.0,this was my first vibrator so i didn't know what to expect but i love it sooooooo much. it is true that there arent exactly 14 different speeds but it didnt matter i only want 2 on and off ha the highest power is mind blowing and gets me everytime. i would definitely recomend this to anyone who asked about it.
1364,"Pineapple Quench Hawaiian Lip Balm - Moistens & Protects, 0.15 oz,(Alba Botanica)",0/0,4.0,"Thr scent is wonderful, and the balm is very good quality. It is a bit pricey, especially because it doesn't last a real long time."
1365,Nutrine Garlic Shampoo 16 oz. Unscented,0/0,5.0,At the suggestion of a friend I wanted to try this shampoo for my thinning hair. Though the product said a time frame of about six months Im happy with the results thus far. My only hang up is the product is not readily available at your local store (beauty or health) so its hard to avoid the charges and shipping knew there was a catch..
1366,PanOxyl Bar 10%,5/6,5.0,This product has NOT been discontinued and should be available in stores near the end of October. Product fell in short supply (temporarily) due to ingredient shortages.
1367,Carex Universal Bath Bench with Back,0/0,5.0,I was wounded in Afghanistan and have lost almost all use of my legs. With this chair I can shower alone with no problem. If you have a need for a shower chair then this is the best there is! It is built solid and fits a standard sized tub perfectly.
1368,"Purina One SmartBlend Dog Lamb Rice, 8-Pounds",0/0,2.0,Two stars is kind. I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.10/04/2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ;-)
1369,Baby Jogger Foot Muff Black,0/0,5.0,"Don't think we could have gone through a winter without this product.Baby can fall asleep in this quite comfortably when strapped in on your walks or when out shopping.The muff along with the plastic weather protector means that baby can sleep in a comfortable and protected environment while you deal with the cold, or wind, or rain.You can zip off the warmer layer in the muff so that you can use it in mild weather as well.Definitely a must."
1370,Dig A Dino Tyrannosaurus Rex,0/0,5.0,"I love T-Rex, because I want to dig T-Rex. This is what my son says about the dig a Dino Tyrannosaurus Rex kit. We have a great time doing this together. He digs and I brush away the dust. It takes a while, but it it worth it."
1371,Mayinglong Musk Hemorrhoids Ointment Cream Value Pack - 3x 10 Grams,3/3,5.0,"This is our second order of cream, suppositories (Mayinglong Musk Hemorrhoids Ointment Suppository Value Pack - 3x 6 Packs/Box) and High Strength Fargelin 36 Tablets per bottle by Yang Cheng Brand. If you find the suppository item, you can order all three for $33.45. My husband experienced his first H and it was horrible. I have never seen him in so much pain. When we placed the first order, all he used was the ointment and sups, his results were quite remarkable and put a huge dent in the pain, but it would not completely go away. I finally convinced him to use the pills....after a few doses (3, 3 time a day...so I recommend ordering three bottles) he had REMARKABLE improvement. Now, he wishes he had started the pills right away. He has taken the entire regimen of treatment for 5 days and is now almost pain free. He still does a sitz bath as often as he can along with this, which seems to give him added relief. If you are looking and tried all the OTC...throw that stuff away and try this! You won't be sorry...just ask my hubby."
1372,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",0/0,3.0,This collar was great a first! It worked for about 6months then we had to buy a new one cause it stopped working. The 2nd one worked for a bit but our dog started to figure out that if she barked 10 or more times the collar would run and then she was a free women to bark all she wants. So we had to keep refilling it. I bought numerous refills and replacement batteries for the collar. It finally got to the point where the collar was just blowing air not even the spray was working. So we finally bit the bullet and went with the shock collar.
1373,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black",1/4,3.0,Electric fat tests are not an exact science. It gives you a +/- picture of your current fat percentage but I do not feel like it is a very accurate assesment. One of my friends is WAY into Crossfit and has a much lower BMI than I do. I am not stupid and followed the instructions and it gave us both the same result. Now I know I am pretty sexy and everything but I do have a spare tire. So if it was a sexy meter maybe but since it's a fat loss monitor not.
1374,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,3/3,5.0,"I'm really impressed by the quality of Auric Blends perfume oils. For being so cheap, they really are great! There's no alcohol or other fillers to dilute the oil, so the fragrance is very strong.Desert Night"
1375,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,I had one of these for my Golden Retriever for 7 years and it broke her from barking right from a puppy. Used it periodically as a refresher as she can be very talkative. This product really works and is more humane than a zap collar.The order was handled quickly and efficiently and I received it on time.Good product and good service. Thanks.
1376,VIRGIN ROSE SPECIAL EFFECTS/HAIR,0/0,5.0,I have been reading such good reviews about this product i just had to try it for myself. The colour is so vibrant and looks awesome in the sun! It's very thick so it didn't drip at all the only thing is that i couldn't squeeze out the last bit so i ended up cutting the bottle and scooping out the last of it since i couldn't bear to let it go to waste... I will most definitely be buying more.
1377,"Blue Grass By Elizabeth Arden Deodorant Cream, 1.5-Ounce",1/1,5.0,"I've used Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass deodorant for many years and it is by far the best on the market! It's subtle aroma is never overpowering, it goes on smoothly and NEVER leaves underarm garments stains! It's the best for me!"
1378,Accoutrements Dashboard Monk,0/0,5.0,I love seeing this Smiling Monk bouncing away in my car. He reminds me not to take myself too seriously. He doesn't interfere with my view of the road and is a terrific companion when traffic is annoying.
1379,Lolita Lempicka,1/2,1.0,"This edu spray was very disappointing. The initial fragrance was nice and light but it faded away very quickly. I think it lasted about 2 hours, which tells me that it is watered down.The shipment was very quick though. This was the first time I have ordered perfume on line and I will not do it again. I believe it's better to buy fragrances at a store."
1380,Nutramax Cosequin for Cats - 80 Sprinkle Capsules,0/0,5.0,"I have a cat who is old. I mean REALLY old. I mean older than dirt. And he is a little pudgy and has some stiffness problems, especially when it's cold. I have been giving him Cosequin for cats and within 2 weeks he was able to jump on the bed when he was unable to before and was simply clawing his way up the side (poor baby). He is now running and playing with the laser pointer like he's a young man again. I am about to order 2 more bottles! By the way, to make it easier to disguise, I don't give him both caps at once, I mix one in his morning food and one in his evening food. He has never complained. :)"
1381,Jason Body Care Satin Shower Body Wash,0/1,5.0,"We actually use this body wash as hand soap. It is gentle on hands and has a really nice yet not overpowering scent of lavender. High quality. Also, fast shipping."
1382,Caruso C97958 ION Steam Hairsetter,0/0,5.0,I love these Caruso steam curlers; so much more effective than a curling iron or dry heat curlers. Leaves my hair full of springy waves and curls that really last even in high humidity. Very easy to use and a good variety of sizes.
1383,"Now Foods, Sweet Almond Oil",2/2,4.0,Great product for a great deal. It arrived quickly and would purchase again. This oil is great for
1384,Neutrogena Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner,0/0,5.0,"This product does exactly what it states. My pores have significantly reduced in size which has helped them to stay unclogged. I have always had a problem with my pores on my chin and nose getting clogged with make-up, but not anymore."
1385,Flowerbomb,0/0,5.0,"This is a very small bottle, but a great size for travel or if you just want to try out the fragrance and make sure that you like it! I love it and have received lots of compliments when wearing it!"
1386,How to Host a Murder,0/0,5.0,I have hosted many murder mysteries and The Last Train From Paris is my favorite by far. I have hosted it 3 times with different sets of friends. During one party no one was able to guess the murderer and during each of the other two parties one of the guests had the murder figured out by the second round. A great mystery and highly recommended for some fabulous fun!
1387,HALO Newborn Micro-Fleece Sleepsack Swaddle,1/1,5.0,While we have received a HALO SleepSack for review we've also bought several of our own in cotton and fleece. They are hands down the safest way to ensure baby is warm enough at bed without putting them at risk with blankets. I find them easy to put on and take off of baby and having the zipper open from the bottom makes diaper changes in the night quick and easy. We used these for my daughter and now I'm getting more for our new baby boy who will be joining us in a few months. I highly recommend HALO SleepSacks!
1388,WEN by Chaz Dean Fig Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz,0/0,5.0,"Great product for ethic hair relaxed or virgin. It detangles, has a fresh smell and moisturizers the hair. I totally recommend this product to women of color."
1389,OPI Pedicure Foot File Replacement,0/0,5.0,I once asked a pedicurist the secret to getting my feet so magically smooth. this is it. It's a staple in my bathroom.
1390,"Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack",0/0,3.0,"Noxzema Eyebrow Shaper, 3-pack it was okay but I felt it was not smooth enough for me and was a bit little for me will have to find a better shaper"
1391,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/0,5.0,"Bought this after I lost my littmann. Seems to perform just as well as my lost +$100 stethoscope but at a fraction of the price. There is a slight compromise in build quality, the tubing that inserts onto the bell can be rotated pretty easily when I remember my littmann feeling more sturdy. However, it performs great and when stethoscopes are easily misplaced or stolen in hospitals this is a great option so next time your out a stethoscope you arent paying another 100 dollars."
1392,Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer,0/0,4.0,"I was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer but it worked great. I have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight, with minimal frizz BUT it did die out exactly a year later. So I guess you get what you pay for....but it was good while it lasted."
1393,Krema Natural Creamy Peanut Butter 16 oz.,1/1,5.0,"I found this to be the absolute best Peanut Butter I've tasted. No comparison.You will have to stir your peanut butter as it settles and oil moves to the top.I buy two at a time. Turn them over and let settling occur at the bottom, then stir.My hint is to keep it in the Refrigerator after mixing...not necessary but useful to me.The roasted flavor is like no other. Good to the last spoonful.I found the product is half the cost at my grocer. I came looking for case pricing,but still found it cheapest at the grocer."
1394,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,2.0,"These leak so bad. Any time my 1 yr old goes number two, I have to change his clothes and mine. His PJs are soaked around the diaper if he sleeps through the night. I am terribly disappointed. I love pampers swaddlers for babies and thought I would try these to save some money, well no money was saved because I feel like I use double the diapers to keep my ""baby dry"""
1395,Tiny Love Super Deluxe Lights and Music Gymini Activity Gym,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this item five and a half years ago for my first baby. She absolutely loved all the activities. She enjoyed all the activities from 4 weeks old until she could crawl at 5 months. My son is now using the gym and like my daughter, loves the mirror. The mirror is a little warped but a great activity for babies. My daughter absolutely loved the elephant. She even played with the toy, pulling the string constantly, well beyond the baby years. My son loves looking at all the contrasting images on the mat and enjoys the little sounds he makes pushing down on the squishy parts of the mat. The openings to attach the toys are perfectly spaced for different levels of eye-hand coordination. The gym is well made and even after washings, the mat holds up. The lights after five and a half years, still work. I would recommend this as a baby shower gift if the mom does not have it in her registry. My babies were/are entertained for at least 20 minutes on the mat. Great for belly-time and my son loves it when he can kick the arches and the animals move around."
1396,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,3/3,3.0,It was in an unsealed box. I haven't tried them yet so all i can describe is how the product looks when it got to me. The product doesn't come like the way the picture shows. The shipping was fast.
1397,Kanekalon,0/1,3.0,I bought this hair I was shocked when I got the hair because the color was really off I thought I ordered dark hair but it was kind of reddish or Oberon hope I spelled that right I have never tried color but took a chance it turned out okay but I think the color chart needs to be changed because the picture looks like dark hair and it was totally off wouldn't mind buying more but afraid that it will be the wrong color I did get it really fast so Thanks Amazon 3 stars are for color mistake
1398,"Lamaze Play & Grow Take Along Toy, Firefly",0/0,5.0,I love this firebly my son plays with it hours on end. Great durability and he drools all over it. So cute and fun for babies
1399,Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,2.0,"I was pleased with this product when I first opened the package. It is made of a relatively thick quilted material to protect the seat, and I do like the plastic tubes that fit between the seat back and bottom to keep the cover in place. It actually worked very well for the first week or so. However there are some issues. The elastic straps on the bottom of the cover probably work great on elevated seats, but for nearly 100% of cars since the 1990's that have rear seats that are molded down into the car these straps don't work. The metal hooks that come with the other straps help to keep the cover anchored, but since nothing keeps those hooks attached to the cover, they get lost or misplaced immediately.The straps that hold the top of the cover to the headrests worked great at first, but after a week one of the very cheap, thin, and flimsy plastic buckles snapped from the weight of my dog as he was trying to maintain balance with the cover sliding on the leather seats under his feet. So now the cover looks terrible, sags on one side, and no longer protects the seat which is the entire purpose. I suppose it works if you want to buy a new one every other month, but then you might as well get a more expensive cover in the first place.2 stars because all this product needs is stronger straps at the top and a more clever seat anchoring system at the bottom. And from what I've read, it used to be that way before this company switched to cheaper components to save money."
1400,PURELL Hand Sanitizer 1000ML NXT Dispenser KIT with TWO ALOE or Original 1000 ML BIB Refill Cartridges,0/0,5.0,"I have had my two Purcell dispensers for 3 months now and I LOVE them. I ordered two and each dispenser came with two refills. They arrived as promised. And in perfect condition. I have one in the kitchen and one in the guest bathroom. With two refills still left over for replacement. They were very easy to install. They have a sticky tape backing and a screw wall mount section on back. I used both. I peeled the tape back, placed on the wall then used screws to secure to the wall. Both may not have been necessary but I figured I wasn't going to move it later so might as well secure it now. The refill bags were very easy to put in. Just feed the nozzle through the opening on the inside of the machine like instructed and adjust bag inside square to close lid and your done. To help my kids to remember to use them I give out reward tickets if I ""smell"" that someone has used it without being reminded. Seems to be working like a charm. And using the name brand like this does work better than generic. Some generics really dry out the hands. Not these. These devices are pretty big and they are brownish in color like you see at offices or restrooms so not very attractive but to stay more germ free I will suffer with the eye sore. They are also not automatic so you do have to compress button with the palm of your hand to use. I opted for these instead of automatic because there were a lot of complaints of the automatics wasting batteries and going off all the time with just mere motion NEAR the machine. So said no thank you to the guaranteed mess waiting to happen. Not to mention waste of product. Hope this helped."
1401,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,5.0,"This stethoscope meets all the expectations one would have for a Littman product. The stealth black is very unique and I have yet to encounter anyone else with one. Naturally, the acoustics are crystal clear and I am able to wear this around my neck for a full 12 hour shift without it being cumbersome."
1402,DaVinci Tool & Still Point Inducer,1/2,5.0,"Still point inducer could come with a bit of instruction, but I figured it out with the internets. The DaVinci tool is great, as it has three levels of pain...rounded for mild, jagged for medium, and pointed for let's break/rip something. But, it does work on those pesky knots that you can't reach, so stop crying you sound like a baby."
1403,germguardian LW18 UV-C Light Wand,0/0,5.0,i have cats and use this item to kill bacteria. have noticed a difference. also good to use on bed.
1404,Rainbow Light Men's One Multivitamin,0/0,3.0,"I used to buy these all the time. Now Rainbow Light makes the same thing but.... organic. I am a nerd when it comes to things like that. I wish I ate well enough every day that I did not feel the need for a vitamin supplement. But as it is, I am happy Rainbow Light is available."
1405,Vivid Body Lotion for Women by Liz Claiborne,0/0,3.0,"Vivid is a very good product from past experiences. However, with a recent purchase, the fragranceseems to be fleeting. It seemed to lack something that makes the fragrance long lasting."
1406,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,2.0,"I was replacing a different type of vibrator, thought this one and its sleek design would be just what the Dr. ordered but it is lack luster and the vibration at the highest speed is medium at best. Who knew finding the ""right"" one would be so challenging? I have to keep looking, maybe mail order is not the best way to seek Mr. right..."
1407,"Himalaya Herbal Healthcare MindCare, Mental Alertness, 120 Vegetarian Capsules",1/1,4.0,"I have only been taking this supplement for the last 5 days while studying and reviewing for my board exams. So far, I have noticed that I am more concentrated on my review material instead of gazing into space and day-dreaming. I've tried other prescription meds to help me with my concentration and this supplement seems to work just as effectively. I take 2 pills at lunch and 2 at dinner time. I may need to cut the dinner time portion to 1 pill since I have trouble falling asleep. The only downside I can see in this product is the taste when taking the pill. If you don't like the taste of sea weed, you will have a hard time getting this pill down. It smells awful and leaves a lingering sea weed flavor in my mouth. 4 stars for the product effectiveness."
1408,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Shark,2/3,2.0,Got this remote control toy for my 3 year old nephew for christmas. He enjoyed playing with it until he played with it during a shower and got water into it. This toy cannot get wet otherwise it will break.. now he just plays with it without the remote. Sadly.
1409,"Omron Sphygmomanometer, Black",0/0,5.0,I am delighted with this cuff. It's professional grade and exactly the same one I used to use in the hospital. I've been using it to check my husbands BP and it appears accurate. No problems and very happy with it.
1410,Durex Condoms,0/0,3.0,I ordered this product. The price was okay but I did not like the one with no lubrication. I wonder how would someone use it like that.
1411,Hylands Hylands Calms Forte Sleep Aid,1/1,5.0,"I have used this formula when feeling anxiety or restlessness at bedtime. It works better than other over the counter sleeping medications. It also calms the stomach if I'm having an acidity problem. If I can't sleep after a few hours I take a second recommended dose. That puts me out like a light. I also give one pill a day to my cat on road trips. It takes a few hours to work, but she sleeps well in the car. I would compare this to Rescue Remedy."

1413,"CytoSport Muscle Milk Ready-to-Drink Shake, Banana Creme, 17 Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)",0/1,2.0,"Muscle milk is a very good product that is very healthy for the individual that is drinking it! It's everything that the product maker of Muscle milk say's it is. We drink Muscle milk by the 14oz, 17oz or 20oz container at least once a day. But you have to watch the way they ship it to you. We had out of the case of 12-17oz containers of liquid muscle milk three broken containers and one that was spoiled but we did received 8-17oz in the case that were up to our expectations. Way to go Muscle mlk"
1414,"De Boles Pasta Artichoke Angel Hair, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"This is a staple in this house, my man loves it. Many times I just sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it and it makes a meal for me or I stir fry some veggies and use that for extra nutrients."

1416,PetSafe Pet Door Replacement Flap,0/0,4.0,"This was for replacement in an older aluminum wall door. The tabs that are supposed to hold in the flap are not as thick as the originalsso after replacing this and the dogs going in and out a few times, I looked up to see that there was a hole in my wall where there shouldbe a flap!!My husband fixed this by pinching the frame in just a bit to hold the flap tighter."
1417,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,5.0,"How did I go so many years without having this product as a part of my morning routine? This mirror is able to provide a view of my face while at the wash basin, but also able to stretch to the shower so I can have a real close-up shave while I am there!"
1418,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,1.0,"My 5th grade daughter bites her nails. She wanted to try this product in hopes it would help her stop biting her nails. However, she says that it doesn't taste that bad, and she continues to bite her nails anyway. (I personally think it tastes awful, but I'm not the one with a nail biting problem.)"
1419,Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer,0/0,5.0,"In my opinion, it doesn't get any better than Hope in a jar. This is an amazing product and a great buy for the money. Amazon never disappoints!"
1420,"Booda Byrdy Bush Interactive Bird Toy, Colors Vary",0/0,5.0,"The type of perch here is wonderful. My cockatiel has used a medium Booda for 15 years, sleeping on it every night all that time.After getting it soaked washing the cage it would droop, but then after drying i could turn it upsidedown and it would br great again.That cockatiel was 17 years old and died last march of natural causes.. but the Booda perch is back in use with my new cockatiel. And she went to it as the first place in the new strange cage to stand!I love all the Booda perches. This is a GREAT perch!!"
1421,Bvlgari Aqua Pour Homme Eau de Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,This is one of my favorite colognes. It's not super strong but it's strong enough that the others can smell it on you for at least 3-4 hours. Every man should give this cologne a chance. Especially at the price of $39.99 at amazon. Love it!
1422,"Hohner / 8"" Toddler Rainmaker",0/0,5.0,Great toy for 9 months and up. Once they can hold it in their hand and twist on their own. The adults liked it as well!
1423,Neutrogena Neutrogena T/Sal Therapeutic Maximum Strength Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"My daughter has Native American heritage from her father's side, so she has extremely dark, course, heavy hair. It has natural wave to it so she straightens it often. She started noticing terrible flaking at her crown and her hairdresser said it looked like build-up of some sort. Because her hair is so dark the flakes showed up really well. As a teenager this was a serious self confidence issue. We tried ""clean"" shampoos to no avail. We swapped to ""dry scalp"" shampoo-still nothing. We knew it was not dandruff so I decided to pick up some T-Sal as a last resort. Thankfully, it works wonderfully! Her hair dresser also suggested a cheap deep conditioner so we went with the 3 Min repair by Aussie. She uses this shampoo every other wash with the 3 min conditioner and her hair is more healthy than I have ever seen it, and flake free!But the hairdresser did mention that using a ""reparative"" conditioner could cause breakage when used with T-Sal. So be wary of the conditioner you buy."
1424,Deborah Lippmann Nail Lacquer,0/0,1.0,"I am a nail polish fiend! I love me some nail polish.Imagine how excited I was to try out the Deborah Lippmann line! Sadly, while the nail polish is in a gorgeous color and goes on beautifully, it chips. It chips within four hours. It chips without a base and top coat. It chips with a base and top coat. It chips. There is literally no wear time for this or the other three Deborah Lippmann products that I purchased at Nordstom.I tweeted about it. I sent emails to the company. Nothing. Nada. Worse customer service ever."

1426,Clif Kid ZBar,0/0,5.0,"Other reviewers have said great things both about the Clif Kid Zbars in chocolate chip and about the entire company. All I want to add is that my toddler LOVES these. He will eat one, then ask for more. I am so glad that there is a healthier snack option out there to compete with cookies. And I don't feel too guilty giving him a ""bar"" snack on days when he refuses breakfast. Though smaller than Clif bars, they do seem large for a toddler. But great for kids. I often snack on them too. Just because my toddler eats them, don't assume that they are small."
1427,"Bio Spot Carpet Powder with Linalool & Nylar, 16-ounce",3/3,5.0,"We had a couple bouts of fleas in this hot, dry late summer. I spinkle this on my carpets in the morning and then sweep it. When I come home from work I vacuum it up. It works on my expensive rugs too. I haven't had the fleas come back since. I really only used this and then bathed our dog/ sprayed his bedding with another fleas spray. This product kills fleas and larvae. I highly recommend it."
1428,"Pet Buddies PB5578 FurBeGone Cat Grooming Brush-TPR, Green",3/3,5.0,It is a great way to remove hair. It worked like a charm on our rugs!!!!! Just brush it on the rug/fabric and it collects the hair all to the side.. Then you just vaccuum it up or even pick it up.
1429,Natural Balance HTP Calm,0/0,5.0,"This natural product contains 5-HTP and St. Johns Wort, both supplements recognized for the ability to calm and sooth life's stressors, is amazing. My daughter has been taking this product for some time now and she's noticed a huge difference in her life. She's not so stressed and is able to deal with 'things' in a more logical way. Keeping control and not going down the long path of globalizing little things is what it's all about. Great combo for a very good price."
1430,CarboZyne - 60 Capsules Fat Blocker & Carb Blockers Atkins,1/1,3.0,"I have not lost any weight and it does not curb my appetite. Might work for some, but did not for me."
1431,Wild Thymes Indian Curry Dipping Sauce,0/0,5.0,"Ok, so food is pretty subjective, but I am a huge Indian food fan. I am not the most refined man though.So from my philistine-like point of view, this is really good. I didn't use it as dipping sauce. I cooked up some chicken and cut the sauce with a little bit of water to give it a better consistency for cooking. Tossed some veggies in and served it over rice.It was fantastic. Great flavor, but not overpowering. If you like Indian food and making it for yourself, this is a nice addition to you pantry. I still have some left over, so maybe I'll try it as a dipping sauce next and update my review. But for now, I couldn't be happier."
1432,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"Color is awesome! Easily dressed up or down. Two coats would be best, but the color is awesome once it's put on."
1433,Revlon ColorStay Overtime Liquid Lipcolor,1/1,5.0,"This lipstick really stays on for a full day and probably longer if you don't take it off at night before sleeping. It also stays on coffee cups, spoons, etc. through a dishwasher cycle so check carefully when unloading the dishes to be put away or your house will look like a bad restaurant. I use Neutrogena eye make-up remover to remove it at night and I have read that some people use baby oil. If you want to go all day without worrying about your lipstick, this is the product for you. Sometimes I wonder what exactly is in it to make it stay on so long, but it's probably better for my peace of mind not to know."
1434,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,4.0,"I ordered this for my 95lb Doberman Vito. I thought it would be larger but I suppose I under estimated the size of my own boy. As soon as I took it out of the packaging Vito had to have it. He loves it and all though it's a bit too small for him, he will not give it up. It's of great quality and washes very well. Definately recommend for your puppy."
1435,"Flexi Retractable All Belt Lead, 16ft",1/1,5.0,My dog is about 50 pounds but very strong and this leash help me to take control of her. Never tangled and very good quality.The price is lower that the ones I saw in pet stores for other retractable leashes of inferior quality.
1436,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure,1/1,5.0,"Been using this jojoba oil as a facial moisturizer and it works fantastic! The oil absorbs quickly into my skin. The results are smooth, soft, glowing skin! Couldn't recommend this product more!"
1437,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,0/0,5.0,"I got this as a present for my girlfriend. In the past when I have ordered butterfly gardens they have been poor quality and the caterpillars took forever to ship. I could not be happier with this purchase. The net itself is excellent quality and well made, no flimsy parts. The caterpillars ship very fast as long as you are within the allowed months. The nice thing is you can order caterpillar refills right from amazon. This would be perfect for teaching kids about the stages of a butterfly."
1438,Lovely Eau de Parfum for Women by Sarah Jessica Parker,0/0,5.0,I love this parfume and so do everyone around me.. It is perfect! And it is a great deal with this price..
1439,McVitie's Digestive Biscuits -400g 3 Pack,0/0,5.0,Digestive biscuits are really very satisfying and quite healthy cookies. They are made with whole grains and great for snacking. It is hard to find them in the supermarket so we were really pleased to be able to buy them from Amazon.com
1440,Mystic Smoke,0/0,2.0,"i agree with Elijah5585, its all ""yay"" and fun by the look of the product but... i bought it and it smells, its extremely sticky, and by making the ""smoke"" its like feather weight strings of the liquid that floats. i hope its not toxic, i got animals. Maybe i'll put a video of it soon"
1441,"SE Self Locking Bag 2MIL, 2in X 3in",1/1,5.0,The bags are true to size and excellent quality. I've ordered mini zip locks from plenty of different sellers and these are by far more superior in quality.
1442,"Canidae Dry Dog Food for Senior and Overweight Dogs, Platinum Formula",0/0,5.0,"Because of the price, I decided to only feed this to my oldest (and only overweight) dog (out of 3 dogs). She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy. I adopted all of them, but I believe she is about 11. I haven't weighed her, but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag! I'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks, which is incredible. I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods. We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it; it's actually a great value if you have Prime; which is worth it if you're going to be ordering heavy items such as this."
1443,Triangles,0/0,4.0,Our Early Childhood class had one of these & my daughter was immediately drawn to it so I bought one for at home. I love it because it's bright and it easily hooks to the chain that I would attach to her stroller or car seat. I also like that it is wood instead of plastic.
1444,Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser,1/1,5.0,"I got this product hoping that it would help ease my dogs itching. It Did. About a month after using it daily I was able to notice results. He had stopped itching himself considerably - allowing his hair to regrow in those areas that irritated him, his hair was shedding less, and his coat was shiny and VERY soft. My dog loves the taste and he looks forward to it every morning. I highly recommend this product."
1445,"Glow Stick Necklaces- Tube of 50 22"" Premium Glow Stick Necklaces Mixed Colors",1/1,1.0,"The sleek pillar of a box arrived stamped ""Amazon"" in a bold type. We all quickly gathered around to carefully unveil the contents. No silly paper wadding nor other buffers obscured the broken package of Glowsticks inside. Still dimly shining their dying glow, hopes of maniacal rave dances to come fled into the ether. Luckily, Amazon Prime returns rock, so at least the cash was not wasted. Seek elsewhere your neon delights oh brave soldier, this seller sucks too hard to yet deserve your cash."
1446,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,1/1,2.0,"I did not like the BandIt brace. It was less comfortable and more difficult to adjust than other elbow counter force braces I've tried. Also, I wore it on my left forearm and the exposed velcro completely ruined a good wicking polyester golf shirt in only one round of golf. The velcro rubbed against the shirt on every swing and just shredded it. I've been using elbow braces for many years and never had one damage a shirt before. The BandIt went straight into the garbage can after that."
1447,"StarMark Training Collar, Large, Blue",0/2,1.0,"What you see on Tv or what you read about this collar is alot different than the results you get for the most part. My dog has alot of fur around his neck so it doesnt work so great. Its USELESS as far as trying to keep my dog from jumping up on people, or stopping him from pulling. He still pulls, not always as bad but it doesnt stop him when he has his mind set on something. As far as putting it on him-- RRIIIGHHT---- What a joke! If you can manage to Not get your dog to move for 2 minutes, maybe, but good luck with that! Its a pain in the### to get on him. I honestly stopped using it because its so frustrating trying to get it on his neck. You cant just slide it on or off your dog, you have to mess with it and twist and turn it until it snaps on or off. I could see it working if you have a tiny dog, but on anything bigger-- good luck! I wouldnt reccomend this product to ANYONE!"
1448,"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White",0/0,3.0,"Just assemble it last night and it took me and my husband 4hrs to put it together. Missing hardware pieces for under drawer (Though I can still use it without them) Actual product does not look as cute as picture shown here. Corners chipped. I will diffidently change the knobs (color does not match drawers, paint see through original wood). I did not see any review in regards drawer rails, it's plastic!! Don't know how long it will last..... For your/baby's health, assemble it in open environment and make sure air out before put baby cloths in drawer. For safety issue, I think manufacture should increase the height of the top frame (head and toe pieces) so that baby will stay within (not all parents can find a perfect spot to place this station at the corner of the room)."
1449,Bvlgari White Eau De Cologne Spray,0/0,5.0,I was a bit skeptical b/c the price seemed almost too good to be true but I thought well it is coming directly from Amazon. I received this product within a week and it was in the original box wrapped with plastic. It smells great.
1450,Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,0/0,5.0,"The pillow comes with a flyer showing you different uses for the pillow, you can twist it in different shapes to assist you in different sleep positions. its at the perfect height to support your neck.. i love how it supports the belly i didn't expect that when i bought it.. overall its the best buying decision i have made since getting pregnant :)"
1451,"Florida Orthopedics Healwell Cub Plantar Fasciitis Night Splint Resting Comfort Slipper, Black",0/0,1.0,Did not work for me. Base is too flexible to keep the foot in a good position and the velcro strap across the top cut into the top of my foot.
1452,Wound Wash Sterile Saline Spray,0/0,5.0,"Will not sting or burn, even on open wounds or mucous membranes.Debrides them safely. One complaint---too little for too muchy money"
1453,"Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce",0/0,5.0,As I'm getting older I have been looking for a cleanser that will not dry my face out any more than it already is (I have some flaking on my face). I have tried every cleanser Olay offers and none worked. I used Neutrogena makeup remover wipes so I thought I'd try the cleanser as well and it worked! I use this cleanser the alcohol free toner after and Neutrogena moisturizer for combination skin and I have finally found my combo.
1454,Chuckit! Ball Launcher,0/0,5.0,"This is such a great product...prior to this I was throwing softballs for my highly energetic dog and clearly, I couldn't get it far enough for him. And, needless to say, I was HIGHLY reluctant to pick it up after a few throws as it was just too slimy and slippery with his saliva. I love the ease of this product, the cleanliness and the distance I can get out of it, when throwing for my dog."
1455,Andis 01557 Improved Master Professional Clipper,0/0,5.0,Product is great! And the item got here very quickly. I Love the Andis clippers! Would recommend to anyone in need of hair clippers. It is well worth the money I paid.
1456,Everholder FURemover Broom,0/0,1.0,It wasn't as good as the older ones that were black and yellow. Not as heavy duty. Bends to easily as you are mopping. Blue rubber not as heavy as the black.Just not happy with them. I bought 6 of them for work.
1457,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,"Our groomer recommended this for our two dogs but since they were so expensive, she recommended a knock-off. This is the real thing, at the same price as a knock-off, probably an older model, but works like a charm and my kids say it is easy to use and really removes a ton of hair."
1458,"100% Whey, Chocolate Mint 5 lb",0/0,5.0,"I probably would have given this protein powder 3 stars no matter what just for using all natural products. I can't stand artificial sweeteners - they make me sick to my stomach. But I'm going to give it a full 5 stars because it works. I've been growing at a slow, steady pace in the recent past, though I notice I always seem to have some residual soreness. Drinking two shakes a day of this whey protein has virtually eliminated that. I feel I can go full blast at whatever activity I'm doing without worrying how it'll affect me for the following few days. Whatever it is about this whey protein, it's getting into my body in a meaningful way.You probably want to know about the taste. It's kind of bland, like you might expect from a plain vanilla whey protein powder. Nothing gross or offensive to the senses. Then again all I do is mix it with water and ice then chug. If you mix it in a shake with a little milk, or maybe an extra spoonful of sugar, or a scoop of ice cream, it might be really good. Or you might end up with additional volume of bland. Truth is, I kind of like it that way. If you want something different, try the chocolate or strawberry. But do try it."
1459,Now Foods True Calm Amino Relaxer,1/2,2.0,The Shipping was on time and but don't know if this product works or maybe its too soon to know. I have took half of the bottle and didn't feel and relaxing yet.. I'm still not yet convince if this product work.

1461,Mederma Scar Gel,0/0,5.0,"A few weeks ago I managed to skillfully slice a huge hole in my arm. I was positive I would need stitches, it was quite deep. I managed to get it to heal on its own but I knew that left unattended, it would leave a terrible scar. Everyone I knew recommended I use Mederma. Reading the ingredients, I was hesitant. They seem like things in my spice cabinet for the most part, not something to make skin heal.I am so glad I didn't let that stop me. I am on day 3 of using this and my cut has already gone from blatantly obvious to something that looks months old. If this is a new scar, I HIGHLY recommend this product. Definitely get it as soon as your wound scabs over!Buyer beware"
1462,Alpha CF Cold and Flu 120 Tablets,0/0,5.0,"I found over the years that I started having adverse reactions to conventional cold medications, so was looking for alternatives. I didn't know much about homeopathic but tried alpha cf, and was amazed at how effectively it worked on my cold symptoms.My husband continued to use his perscription medications, which also gave him bad side effects.Eventually he gave in and decided to try the alpah cf too, and almost immediately he declared that he was switching to it, and now always uses it faithfully when he gets sick, and makes sure we always have it on hand.I don't know yet if amazon's price is better than my local Co-op's, but I'm going to check.It's always better to use products that are designed to support the body's own defenses rather than to take foreign and unnatural chemicals that force your body to do what's unnatural."
1463,PetzLife Oral Care Gel Original Peppermint 4oz,0/0,5.0,My dog had the WORST smelling breath ever... I applied this stuff twice a day and after about a week I could actually tolerate playing with my dog! I will definitely be ordering more..
1464,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,4.0,"This isn't the first product we've gotten from Fisher-Price, they are well known for their children and infant products. This one is no different. It is sturdy, and has quite a bit to do on it that my kid enjoys (especially the things you spin). He started using it at 3 months old (he's a pretty large baby), and loves to bounce in it.The seat height is adjustable so you can raise it as your child gets bigger (three height settings). It has an average footprint, so if you live in a smaller house it might take up a bit of space, but otherwise it should be fine. The product seems to be holding up well, and it was very easy to put together."
1465,Optimum Pro-Complex Vanilla 2.2 lb,0/0,5.0,This product is the best I'm telling you !! I've only been on it for about 2 months and with good training you see the resaults.. And that's me eatingMostly whatever which isn't good .. I'm also taking this supp with Pre Load creatine by Optimum nutrition and it's a really good combination ..if u don't work out like a body builder u wont see the results ..
1466,Gladiator Set- Silver,0/0,5.0,"My 4-year-old had decided well in advance that he wanted to be a knight for Halloween so I purchased this thinking it looked like something he might be able to use well after a night of candy and fun. And I was beyond right! It is fun, durable, fits him just right with room to grow yet, and is his new favorite toy! With 3 kids between the ages of 1 and 9, I have purchased many costumes that were way over priced for being worn only once or twice. This costume is a first and well worth even twice its price. I don't know who's more excited"

1468,Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket Plus,2/2,5.0,"When my original PR broke, I picked this one up as a replacement. Wow! Better than the original in many ways. I'd broken two PRs when changing the battery. With the location away from the mechanisms on this one, looks like that won't be a problem anymore. Highly recommenced over the original for this reason. Also like the speed adjustment."
1469,Denman Classic Styling Brush,0/0,5.0,This is one of those rare products that does what it's supposed to do. It's reasonably priced and made of durable materials.
1470,Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord,0/0,3.0,"Worked great until it didn't... I liked the retractable cord for ease of storage, but was disappointed that one morning (without any warning signs) it just didn't work! I blow dry 3-4 x wk for just a couple of minutes each time (I have really thin hair), so this hairdryer was not ""overworked""... Compared to my past dryer that lasted 10 yrs, I'd say this one was not the best quality, but it's also not super expensive, so the buyer will have to weigh the cost vs. the quality..."
1471,BSN N.O.-Xplode Extreme Pre-Training Performance Igniter 2.25 lb (820 g),2/2,1.0,"I was a big fan of this stuff for at least 3 years. I started my senior year of high school and continued through most of college. The stuff works. I have never had a better stimulant. You could be dead tired and take a scoop or two of this and be ready to lift.The pumps are what makes this stuff great to use. INCREDIBLE pumps. After an intense set of bicep curls I thought my skin was going to tear. It will make you look huge your entire workout. The creatine in it also makes you look bigger after a while.Then I had a routine blood test because of an illness.....High liver enzymes. The doctor expressed concerns about my high liver enzymes and asked about my diet. I mentioned I take a pre workout but he didnt seem too concerned with it. He retested me a few weeks later and was perplexed. His concern made me concerned, so I began to examine my lifestyle. I figured the only thing out of the norm was my protein supplementation and my pre-workout supplementation. After a quick internet search I came across similar concerns. I decided to check Amazon reviews and found the others with similar problems. I stopped taking this supplement immediately. About a month later I figured it was out of my system and set up an appointment for a blood test. Sure enough, it was normal.Since there is NO regulation from the FDA on these products, it is up to the consumer to educate themselves on what they are ingesting. DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT. Does it work? Yes. Does it do what it says it will? Yes. Does it damage your liver? YES. That isn't a trade-off I am willing to take. I know of many high school and college kids that abuse the hell out of this stuff and I would imagine they will have unpleasant consequences down the road.I would suggest taking a pre workout without a bunch of crap in it. Amino Energy from Optimum Nutrition is a solid choice. You won't have as much energy or as nice of pumps, but you also won't be slowly killing yourself.BE A SMART CONSUMER. This needs to be pulled from the market."
1472,Maeda-En - Shiki Matcha (green tea powder) 1.0 Oz.,0/0,4.0,This is a great option for every day drinking. If you want something more fragrant try the Maeda-En ceremonial quality matcha.

1474,MILITARY ENERGY GUM - Military Caffeine Energy Gum - CINNAMON - TRAY (24 packs 5pc) - 100mg Caffeine per piece,0/0,3.0,The gum gives you a pep but the taste isn't so good. The gum has a cinnamon taste but a strong after taste.
1475,"Lipton Herbal Tea, Quietly Chamomile, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",1/1,3.0,"Lipton tea co. made the biggest mistake by discontinuing this tea. Now I'm trying to find this tea where I can, but the vendors are taking advantage of the fact that the public can't readily get this tea anymore. Now they want anywhere from 42 to 70 dollars for a 6 pack. Just rob me at gun point would you. This is a lovely tea, very soothing and relaxing. Good sleep aid."
1476,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,I really love the smell of this soap and knowing that there are no toxic ingredients in it is the best part. It does NOT dry my skin. I use a lot of it every time I bathe but it still lasts a long time. It's worth the price! Note

1478,Source Naturals Nadh,1/2,5.0,Source Naturals ENADA NADH is critical for the Krebs cycle. For those of us with excitotoxicity of the brain this is a critical element in restoring natural function. The previous reviewer does not need this product but obviously needs something else. This is for a very specific population and it keeps us functioning at a higher level than we could otherwise. Please don't knock the product out of ignorance.

This year, it DID NOT work at all, and I have wasted over 150.00 on this product. It does not work AT all. Now, I am going to have to take all of them to vet, and get fleas removed from our home! Total waste of money, and no recourse apparantly? I am not sure what they changed in this product, but it is not the same, and I wish they had informed customers like myself, who have been using this for years. Now, I am going to be spending hundreds of dollars to get rid of the fleas!Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens, 6 Doses"
1480,Evenflo Position and Lock Wood Safety Gate,1/1,2.0,"When mounted at a tension that kept it firmly in the doorway, it put enough stress on the wood that it broke. We repaired it, and it broke in a new location. Get this product instead"
1481,Wellgate for Women Slimfit Wrist Support,1/1,5.0,"I purchased this item about 7 months ago. It was a bit uncomfortable for a few days, but it broke in very quickly. I have no idea what is wrong with my wrist. Haven't seen a doctor. It bothers me mostly when I am driving, using the computer, and working in the lab. I wore this thing religiously for a month, and it got 100% better. Then I stopped wearing it, and it started hurting again after a week. Then I wore it for another month, and so on.Now I am wearing it most of the time, ESPECIALLY when I am sleeping, using the computer, and driving. It is a little awkward to wear when writing though. After 7 months of taking it on and off, the velcro is starting to wear out. I can't say I didn't get a ton of use out of it though!As long as I am wearing this thing, my wrist doesn't hurt. It is comfortable on my thin wrist. I'd highly recommend it. I'm about to order a new one."
1482,1 Gallon Bottle Dispensing Pump Standard,1/3,1.0,Purchased for my sister. She states that the product leaks. Not very good . Perhaps for a gallon sized bottle not a mouth wash bottle.
1483,"PetSafe Heated Wellness Sleeper, Small, Hunter Green/Sand",0/0,5.0,"The bed arrived very quickly, and my 15-year-old cat loves it! She sleeps in it everyday. The small bed size is perfect for her, as she is about 10 pounds and has room to spread out. I should have gotten a heated bed for her years ago!"
1484,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,3.0,Bright pink without being fluro pink. With two coats its an amazing color. Add a top coat for perfection and a salon finish at home
1485,"JW Pet Company GripSoft Nail Clipper for Dogs, Medium",2/2,5.0,"My dogs hate getting their nails cut...I didn't realize I was using dull nail clippers until I tried these. Now, they barely notice when I clip their nails and I can even do it when they are asleep."
1486,CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit,0/2,2.0,"I got this and opened it and wondered why they would sell this cat toilet seat with no directions and why they would charge what they did for this piece of plasitc. Then, I looked on the back and realized that it was supposed to also come with a little book with directions but mine did not. Luckily I bought a cat training book separately as well."
1487,Nature's Gate Skin Therapy Lotion,0/0,5.0,"I totally love this cream. It's not too thick and not too thin. A bit ""waxy"" but it spreads well and absorbs well. I like the tea tree scent (some people don't like it at all) and the scent does not linger more than an hour or 2. It's lovely on hot days to cool down and refresh. Not sure that it's all that effective at calming irritation or getting rid of itching. I don't think it's a miracle cure for those ailments. It's by far the best lower priced natural body lotion products I have tried."
1488,Desert Essence Deodorants,1/1,3.0,"This deodorant rolls on really easily. It doesn't pass the Indian Summer sweltering heat test. It doesn't last. it works perfectly fine for everyday use where you won't sweat through heavy exertion or exercise, but if you exercise or get caught in a very hot day, it needs to be reapplied. That's why, for my needs, it's average or just okay. I've found better"
1489,"StoneTech RVC4-1G Revitalizer Fresh Citrus Tile and Stone Cleaner, 1-Gallon",1/1,4.0,"I've been using this brand of granite cleaner for about 5 years, and I love it. It cleans my granite counter tops perfectly and does not leave any smears or smudges. I also use it on the porcelain surface of my cooktop. This is the first time I have purchased the citrus scent. While it is pleasant, I prefer the cucmber scent that I had used previously."
1490,"Bone-A-Mints All natural, Wheat-Free Breath Freshening Bone",1/1,5.0,I found out my dog is allergic to chicken and chicken-by-products. You don't realize how many dog treats include chicken ingredients. These Bone-A-Mint treats are perfect for him. Nice balance of ingredients. Highly recommend!
1491,Keurig K-Cup Coffees Timothy's Columbian Decaf K-Cup Coffee 18 K-Cups,1/1,5.0,You would never know this was a decaffeinated coffee unless you read the label.This is a full bodied coffee without a trace of bitterness. The only satisfying decaf I've found.
1492,"Hear No Evil 1/2 Oz Bottle - Ear Drops for Ear Infections, Healing and Pain Relief.",1/1,5.0,"I had an ear infection, no insurance. My symptom was a feeling of pressure that would not be fixed by holding my nose and blowing. This product had lots of garlic, so If it was a fungus infection it would fix me.After a month or so of using this i felt better. Maybe it was time, or maybe it was the drops, i'm just happy i feel better."
1493,Zeno Acne Clearing Device with 60-Count Cartridge,1/1,1.0,"Zeno is no longer selling/supporting this product, so there are NO replacement tips available, other than at a several hundred percent markup here on Amazon! Do not buy this product!!!"
1494,"Ethical Sponge Soccer Balls Cat Toy, 4-Pack",0/0,5.0,"I am surprised at how much our cats love this toy. I bought these soccer balls because I saw a recommendation on a cat blog. My cats do not like other ball toys, so I didn't have high hopes, but still thought it was a worth a shot.We've only had these balls a few days now, and I'm sure the novelty will wear off, but for now I'm really enjoying watching my cats (both age 3) bat these balls around, then down the basement steps and bringing the balls back upstairs in their mouth. It's so funny to watch and they look like they're having a great time."
1495,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,0/0,5.0,"I love the freedom this provides. No more tampons!! I got it and was hesitant that it would be hard to use, but it was so easy to use! No leakage even from the first use. I don't think I have ever been happier with a period product. Just clean it in the shower, reinsert and you are good to go! I have never had to take it out in public yet, but I don't think I will ever have to since you can wear it up to 12 hours at a time. I also wear nuvaring and they were perfectly fine in there together."
1496,Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover,0/0,5.0,I went to PetSmart to purchase this hoping that it would get the vomit odor out of my carpet. For 3 days I tried scrubbing with many different products and nothing worked. Eventually I found Nature's Miracle and it really works. I would definitely recommend you to buy it.
1497,Saitek Mephisto Competition Game Clock,0/0,5.0,"This clock is a great value. I've used other clocks that are much more expensive and there isn't that much of a difference. It runs on two size ""C"" batteries which makes it very convenient."
1498,"Extra Polar Ice Sugarfree Gum, 15-Stick Plen-T-Paks (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,I have a high oral need and chewing gum keeps me from pigging out all day. Extra has no calories and this is my 2nd favorite flavor after BUBBLE GUM Extra!!! :-)

1500,"Crushed Watermelon Seed, 4 oz.",0/0,4.0,"I love this tea. It's a milky color with a slightly sweet creamy taste. I use it as a base for my green smoothies in the morning, and I add it to the hibiscus/olive leaf tea I drink throughout the day. It cuts through the acidity and bitterness in the hibiscus/olive leaf.I've been drinking the hibiscus tea for several years, which has a strong diuretic effect, and haven't noticed that the watermelon seed tea has made it any worse. I also don't know whether it would have that effect on its own.The instructions say to make it fresh every day but I make 4 cups every other day and store the extra in the fridge.I'm using it because I read it was good for my blood type. I don't have kidney problems.The only thing that would make it better was if the seeds were organic."
1501,"Just for Men Shampoo-In Hair Color, Dark Blond/Lightest Brown H-15, 1 application, (Pack of 3)",0/0,4.0,"I've used this for a few years now.I gave up on professional hair dressers. Tried several and got dark brown, not the light color I asked for. I don't want big change, just avoiding white hair.This is close to my original color. My hair goes white, not grey.I color every 3 weeks, and time for 4 minutes from start of application. Waiting 4 weeks or more leaves white unsightly roots, as well as color fading.Overall satisfied, reasonable price for a good even color. Fooled an old friend of over 40 years who didn't know I was coloring.Be careful about spills or splatters. Cleaning quickly works, but the color will dye floors, walls, etc if left any amount of time.Use conditioner immediately, the color initially gives a strange coating."
1502,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,5.0,"I purchased these support stockings for my mother due to her legs swelling. When she wears them, she has no swelling at all. They have worked great."
1503,"Virbac Knockout Room Fogger, 6 oz",0/0,5.0,"This is a great product. My daughter brought her cat for us to babysit and she had fleas, but by the time I realized it our living room was infested. I tried over the counter products but within a couple of days the fleas were back. My retired vet told me about VIRBAC. We followed the directions and BINGO our problem was solved with no after smell. I plan to get more for the basement to get rid of all the creepy crawlers. GREAT PRODUCT"
1504,Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,I'm wearing it right now. It's a sweatband--and there's NOOOOOO sweat in my eyes! Now if only I could find matching terry cloth stretchy pants...
1505,Bare Escentuals BareMinerals,0/0,4.0,"I received my product on time and its the right color but my container doesn't twist and click to lock into place, so I always have minerals floating around in the lid. Not the biggest problem, I'll live."
1506,Chlorpheniramine 4mg Tabs - Pet Allergy Relief 100ct,0/0,5.0,Ive had this stuff for a month and my dogs hot spots are filling in with hair! Im using this along with an anti itch dog shampoo and couldnt be happier with the results!
1507,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"It is so weird to me that this color looks so different in pictures. Even with my own camera it looks more pretty than in real life. I'm going to upload the picture, but you really won't know what color it is until you see it in person. I can tell you that if you are looking for a Tiffany Blue, this is definitely not it. It's still a pretty color IMO , but in a different way and in a different style."
1508,Liz Claiborne Curve Crush Cologne Spray,0/0,3.0,"This mens cologne product has a strong aroma but pleasant. Shipping the product however is another story. The product does not have a ""top"" to protect it when shipping; it has a ""clip"" type attachment that is supposed to keep the atomizer from spraying during shipping. That ""clip"" does not work. My product arrived timely but there had been some leakage. I think they can vastly improve on that issue by having a normal top to protect the atomizer part."
1509,King Kong in Chains on Stage - Movie Maniacs Deluxe Edition Figure,0/0,5.0,King Kong in Chains on Stage - Movie Manaics Deluxe Edition Figurethis product was well made and very reasonable for the price.it has great details and good size for people who like to collect old king kong models. i was impressed with the quality.
1510,"Designer Skin Bombshell Tanning Lotion 100XX Dark Tanning Bronzer With White Tea Extract, Soy and CoQ-10 Bombshell Lotion Sizzle Bronzer Lotion 13.5 oz",0/0,5.0,"Bought this product when it first came out some years back. Much better then the newer version made recently. I use tingle lotions a lot, so the tingle on this product (at least for me) cools off rather quickly. Get great results. If your not used to lotions with a tingle factor in them, start off with a much milder tingle lotion and then work your way up to this one. Will buy again."
1511,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I decided to buy it after reading the reviews, and I also google the nail polish to see how it looks like and I wasn't disappointed at all when I got it... I will buy it again =)"
1512,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,5.0,"My dog loves her new steps to my bed. Very sturdy and strong, not like those ones that have a covering over them and fall easily."
1513,"Now Foods, L-Arginine & Ornithine 500/250 mg",4/5,5.0,"the combination of both Arginine & Ornithine in a 2 to 1 ratio is extremly powerfulI suffered from 20+years of preiphreial artey disease- my veins bulged out and very painful even to walk , but these supplements cured my problems 100% when moderm medicine couldnt.IN ADDITIONthis combination when taken at bed time will activate your pituitary gland ( it shrinks by 1%every year after age 30- this is 1 of the reasons why we show signs of aging)but this stimulates and makes the gland grow and it produces Human Growth Hormones, ALSO it helps stimulate new growth in your organs, heart,liver etc ALSO it relaxes your blood vesels as to prevent hardening of the arties thruought ur body. Many people take this just to get off blood pressure medicine and report a drop in 30pts or more- of course this is with a good diet.I always trusted the NOW brand and havent been dissapointed , we all need to look to supplements and alternatives to modern medicine cause they only provide band aids not solutionsPlease for refrence stay away from High Fructose Corn Syrup , its in many,many products- read the label people from soda, fast food,ketchup,ice cream,pickles, most sweets etc It tells the brain your not full and u keep eating and drinking more of it.Your body cant digest it and it sits on top of liver causing fatty liver disease,cirrocis,diabetes etc etc check out naturalnews dot com its a wealth of information"
1514,"Solaray - Children's Multi Chew Cherry, 120 chewable tablets",0/0,5.0,We haven't used these but I bought them to donate to an orphanage for a missions trip. The price was good and the nutritional analysis looked good.
1515,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,4.0,"Bought this for my nursing student daughter. Seems really good. She needed a better one than she had and after some research, this was the one she chose. She likes it."
1516,Viviscal Extra Strenth Dietary Supplement,0/5,3.0,I have only been taking this product for 6 weeks. My understanding is that you have to take it for 6 months to judge results.
1517,"Rainbow Light Women's Answer, Food Based, Tablets, 180 tablets",0/0,5.0,"These vitamins are amazing. I have energy all day long. It helps my moods. And I no longer have food cravings. So I ordered the Men's Multi Vitamin for my brother, and he said that it has helped with all of these things, plus it has helped him think clearer. My daughter takes the Active teen Multi. She is 13, and an athlete. Her face has cleared up completely. I don't know about anything else for her, she doesn't notice those kinds of things. But I love knowing that her vitamins are the best available."

1520,"EVE522FP4 Energizer 9V Alkaline Batteries, 4 per Pack",1/2,4.0,"We have not used any of the batteries in this package - not even to ""power"" the little free electric car that was included in the wrapper.I chose the Energizer brand and this size pack because we've been quite satisfied with Energizer batteries in the past, Amazon has the best price per unit and I know we won't run out......unless my 81 year old husband suddenly develops a great interest in playing with tiny little electric cars..........In fact, it is possible the batteries may be in the drawer long after their expiration date.But, heck, Amazon keeps asking me to write reviews on what I buy, so I did my best for y'all out there."
1521,Clean and Easy Waxing Spa Basic Kit,0/1,2.0,"This is definitely not your water-soluble wax kit - easy on and off. I bought this product for my home. I have been home waxing for YEARS successfully and was hoping to be able to use this again and again over time. Now I am rethinking that. I have only used it once, and so far have found"
1522,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",1/1,4.0,"I have resorted to sleeping in the lounge next to the aquarium when I can't sleep! With the purchase of this item I find the soothing sounds eliminate the need ror a tv, fan or aquarium bubbles to help me drift off. The sound can be a bit repetitive if you listen hard enough, but so far it has been an excellent item. Price is reasonable, just need to see how long it will last now :)"
1523,Aqua Mist Add-A-Stone Aerating Aquarium Ornaments,0/0,2.0,I was looking for a new aerator after my old one wore out. I was very disappointed with this. I have four areas with big bubbles close to the hose fitting and nothing else. I ordered more than one aerator and tried another and had exactly the same experience.
1524,"Nylabone Healthy Edible Bone, Bacon Flavored with Vitamins",0/0,2.0,"I agree with the previous reviewers - I should have listened! My Boston Terrier chewed up and ate an entire bone in less than 5 minutes. This may be a good ""treat"" but I would not call it a chew toy!"
1525,API Freshwater Master Test Kit,0/0,5.0,I started up a tank about 3 months ago. Every fish keeper I know swears by this test kit. I understand why. This is invaluable when cycling your tank and helpful afterwards to make sure all the levels are correct. It is also much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores where it runs about $30.
1526,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"It is so weird to me that this color looks so different in pictures. Even with my own camera it looks more pretty than in real life. I'm going to upload the picture, but you really won't know what color it is until you see it in person. I can tell you that if you are looking for a Tiffany Blue, this is definitely not it. It's still a pretty color IMO , but in a different way and in a different style."
1527,"Babble Ball - Big Size - 3 1/8"" in Blue",0/0,1.0,This is a hard plastic ball. My German Shepherds (I have 3) MIGHT push it around once a week. The voices in this unit are garbled and it hurts your toes when you kick it in the dark. Over all this is a lousy dog toy.
1528,"Medela PersonalFit Small 21 mm Breastshields, 2-pk",0/1,1.0,"I got a medela pump at my baby shower and when I used it I was having problems with my nipples hurting, not being able to produce much milk and from what little bit I did get, it leaked everywhere. This was all with the regular 24mm breastshiled that came with the pump. That was when I noticed a picture in my manual stating that I needed a small size breastshield. Well honestly, I don't see a difference between the small and the medium. If there is any difference it is VERY minimal and it hasn't helped me one bit. I'm extremely disappointed since Medela is suppose to be such a good brand."
1529,Prairie View Industries Threshold Ramp,1/1,5.0,"I now have 3 ramps for my wheelchair, all from Prairie View. I strongly reccomed them. Well made, strong and sturdy. If I needed more ramps, I would go to Amazon and Praire View. I would get what I ordered and needed. Don't hesitate with these sources!

1530,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Strawberry Licorice Wheels, 5-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,This is exactly what I was hoping for. A bunch of good licorice. Nothing unexpected here. Didn't take long for me to eat! I plan on ordering another.
1531,Jacquard Tie Dye Kit,0/0,5.0,I have enjoyed using this tie dye kit. The instructions were easy to follow and my tie dye shirts came out nice. I would suggest this item to anyone!
1532,BRUSHPICKS,0/0,5.0,"This is much better than ordinary wood, bamboo or plastic tooth picks that are too thick. These tooth brushes not only do the job of getting rid of food debris between your teeth, but they will not be pushing your teeth further apart and create more gaps for food debris to be caught. Excellent product."
1533,"BATTERY,AAA,24/PK",1/1,5.0,"great came in fast ,just what i was looking for,i will buy again fron here if i need more,i don't know what else to say"
1534,Melatonin,0/0,4.0,"My Doctor suggested I buy some of these Melatonin and I put it off until this last three weeks. I had not been sleeping before this last three weeks off and on, but in the last three I have only slept maybe once every week. This product has brought relief."
1535,Avigal Henna 100% Natural Hair Color BLACK Intense Ebony 4.5 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"I followed the directions in the package (hot water, henna, and some olive oil)...I let it stay 2 hrs and then rinsed with some conditioner. With my long hair, the application was a mess! The mixture came apart easily and fell everywhere - sink, counter, and floor! A little got on my hand, which discolored the area. I was disappointed with the coverage on the gray hair and had to apply the henna again in the area I have the most grays (20 -25% gray). The second application was more successful. Perhaps, I will try the other reviewer's recommendation next time. This product did take the redish color out of my hair and it made it look healthy and shiny. I would rate this product 3 1/2 stars!"
1536,Flexrake 2 Story US Cats Condo 1025,2/2,3.0,I should have read more reviews. This kitty condo is too lightweight for bigger cats. It is better suited for kittens. Too costly to refund and ship back. I will garage sale. :o(
1537,Cho Pat dual action knee strap,0/0,5.0,Used it for many years but after losing weight I had to get a smaller size. Whenever my knee acts up I use this and my knee quickly feels better.
1538,Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,0/0,5.0,"i'm sure it would have been great for support on pregnant women based on it's texture at least! but my sister gave birth at 25 weeks before this arrived. we were planning she'd use this on her 3rd trimester but oh well things happens. i would just like to appear on your generous hearts to pray for my nephews recovery, baby mateo rafel!TIA we'll use this pillow when he comes home, i saw this can also be used while breastfeeding. :)"
1539,Dragon King's Horse Blue by Papo,0/0,4.0,this toy came when expected and is better than described. It is made very well and seems to be durable.
1540,Laura Mercier Mineral Powder SPF 15,1/1,5.0,Laura Mercier knows what she's doin! I can't put my finger on why this powder looks so much prettier than every other type of mineral powder foundation I wear but it DOES!! It looks so good & my skin looks flawless. I have some discoloration spots from sun damage & it covers it without looking cakey & heavy. You can't go wrong with any purchase from Laura Mercier. I adore everything I buy from her!
1541,Pill Crusher -Pill Pulverizer,2/2,5.0,"I wasn't expecting much from this pill crusher since we'd tried others that did not crush very well. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised! We have to crush all of our daughter's pills to get them through her G-tube and this really does the job. I crush them, pour a little water, and draw them up all in the same container. It's also nice and small to take with us everywhere. Life saver!"
1542,Amber Lyn Chocolates - Sugar Free - Dark Chocolate - 24 Bars,0/0,5.0,"Low in carbs and sugar free, this is the best-tasting sugar-free chocolate I have ever had. No weird aftertaste, and definitely a cut above ""American"" chocolate. Though I am not usually a candy eater because it hurts my teeth, this definitely doesn't bother me. I won't say it is guilt-free at 170 calories, but dark bar with hazelnuts and almonds was intensely satisfying. One a day will do me. I found these at a Costco roadshow and will buy them again at Amazon."
1543,"Betty Crocker Muffin Mix, Blueberry, 6.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)",0/0,4.0,"This is a small muffin mix. The package says it will make 5 standard sized muffins; however, I use it to make 18 mini muffins for lunch boxes. As other reviewers have noted, the blueberry chips are artificial, and not real; however, I don't find that this detracts from the taste. Note that to make these more nutritious, I always use only 1/4 cup water and 1 egg instead of the 1/2 cup water the package calls for. I also stir in 1 tsp of powdered milk with the dry ingredients before I add the liquid. To make them a little fancier, you can sprinkle a little sugar atop each before baking; the kids love it!"
1544,Earth Ball 16 Inch,1/1,4.0,"I got my Earthball at Ecotoys in Italy and use it in workshops that I run around the world. I find it interesting how rough some people can be with it, and it has, as a result, already suffered some damage, springing a leak in the Indian Ocean, and the stopvalve has been torn making if more difficult to empty it of air to carry it to a next location.Nevertheless I find it is an excellent way for visualising our Earth in July (from the clouds, that is what season it is). I would dearly like to include them in the kits we are setting up for trainers of the Dragon Dreaming method.Perhaps people just need to learn that the Earth is not a football! A good lesson for our environmentally challenged age."
1545,Lip Gloss,0/0,5.0,I have gotten lots of compliments on this product! I am a big fan! I would definitely order it again!
1546,"Weiman Glass Cook Top Cleaner, 10-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"After having our stovetop for 2 years and multiple old stains that we hadn't been able to get up using standard good old fashioned cleaning tricks, I thought we were simply stuck with these stains. My husband picked Weiman's stovetop cleaner at our local grocery store as it just happened to be the first one he saw. After covering the stovetop with Weiman's and a few minutes scrubbing, most stains are gone and our stovetop looks FANTASTIC! With just the first scrubbing I'm very pleased, well worth the $5 we spent! I am hopeful too with a little more time and elbow grease I'll be able to get the last stubborn areas cleaned up too and have our stovetop looking truly brand new!"
1547,Revlon RV484 Ion 1875 Watt Hair Dryer,0/0,1.0,Only had this for 6 months and it died. I have short hair and only used this once a day. VERY disappointed with the quality of this item!
1548,Now Foods L-Carnitine 500mg 30 Capsules,1/1,5.0,My husband has been taking this for some time. I read in theBeat Your A-Fib
1549,Melissa & Doug Giant Plush Stuffed Sea Turtle,0/0,5.0,I received this product without scratchiness and it is definitely a solid turtle that is adequate to cuddle with. Definitely a stuffed animal to be loved for a long time. Last but not least this is VERY SOFT.
1550,Batman Dual-Compartment Lunch Kit by Thermos Insulated,0/0,5.0,Perfect lunchbox to go with his Pottery Barn Batman Backpack. It is well made and I believe will last the school year!
1551,Classic Wood Chess Set,0/0,2.0,It is smaller than it looks like. The pieces are falling easily. No numbers or letters on the board like they should be. If you want to teach your kids real chess don't buy this set. It is not worthy. And pretty expensive for what are you getting.
1552,Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil,0/0,5.0,"My husband and I started researching stretch oils, lotions, and products right away when I became pregnant as he's a photographer and I've done a bit of modeling. We didn't want any stretch marks! We decided on one bottle of Earth Mama's to try it out. I've had sensitive skin my whole life, so I was skeptical that it wouldn't make me break out. Not only did it sooth those itchy feelings as my belly stretched, it really worked and I never had a reaction to it! I'm 37 weeks pregnant and NO STRETCH MARKS! We've purchased 5 bottles to get me through the pregnancy. I started out a 107 lbs and baby and I are now 130 lbs. According to my husband, I'm ""all baby"" with a basketball in front. This product really helped my skin to stretch slowly and gently. I've used it faithfully 2-3 times/day (no skipping applications). I'd recommend it to anyone."
1553,Siphotrol Plus Area Treatment For Homes-24 oz. spray,1/1,4.0,"One star off a bit reluctantly because it wasn't 100% effective immediately.Fleas are tenacious little buggers. We have two, long haired dogs. It's tough to see the fleas on furniture or in carpet, easier to find them on the dogs. In the past, Frontline Plus seemed to control or prevent the problem and prevent a house infestation, but not this year. Maybe it was the dry weather. It was a battle. We tried over the counter flea bombs, two brands; someplace between immeasurably marginal and a total waste of money.Based on the vet's recommendation, we tried the canned aerosol and this pump sprayer. Either is OK, more for your money with the pump sprayer. Also used a sticky paper Victor Ultimate Flea Trap (Amazon), but we use the flea trap more as a measure of how bad the infestation is; it will not solve the problem. Count the fleas trapped in 24 hours, when it gets down to 1 or 2 you just about have things under control. Zero and you can break out the champagne.The Siphotrol products seem to be largely effective immediately. The label says it kills adult fleas on contact and I won't argue with that but the critters seem to hide or hatch continuously. It certainly knocks down the population but it takes another week or so to eliminate the problem. It did not require a second application. Also, if you've chased fleas you know they're fast and elusive, but after the Siphotrol, if they're still living they're pretty lethargic.We used the Siphotrol product on the carpet and furniture, and Barklogic's Lemongrass Tick and Flea Pet Wash (Amazon) on the dogs, one application each and the problem was maybe 90+% resolved the first day, stragglers gone within a week. The Siphotrol has almost no smell, nothing residual. Though the dogs love to swim, they have always loathed a bath. FWIW there's something about this Lemongrass product that they both liked, very mild, pleasant aroma and you could see the fleas going down the drain."
1554,"Micro Mask, 1 oz",2/2,5.0,"This product is specific to masking of hobby models or other small areas. You typically apply the product with a brush to area on the model that needs to be painted with a detail or design. When the solution drys you take an hobby knife and make an outline cut and pull away any excess material. (Lets say you wish to paint a square - you would make cuts in the material in the shape of a square - peel the square away leaving an area to be painted) It leaves a mask - almost like a stencil or painters tape. You can then paint the area. After painting you peal away the mask material and this leaves a clean line or painted design.It does take a little practice and you do need to use a lite touch when you use the hobby knife so as not to cut the surface you wish to paint.It is a helpful product, but you should practice using it on scrap material before moving to using it on the actual surface."
1555,Melissa & Doug Jumbo Knob Wooden Farm Puzzle,0/0,5.0,My kids really played a lot with this puzzle while they were toddlers.And now that they are 5 and 7 sometimes they still play with it. Highly recommended!!!
1556,Baby Buddy 5 Pack Size-It Closet Organizers,0/0,5.0,Exactly what I needed for the new babies room and closet. Arrived right on time and was a very reasonable price!!
1557,"Philosophy Supernatural Airbrushed Canvas Powder, SPF 15",0/0,5.0,"This product does a better job than my combination of using a concealer, a foundation, and a correcting powder. It goes on in seconds instead of minutes, and it leaves a flawless look. I have very oily skin, and I have always fought with it all day. Not anymore! I have a red tone on several spots of my face, and this powder completely conceals that for hours. Around mid-day I use blotting papers to remove excess oil, and I reapply the powder just a touch in trouble areas. For less oily skin, I would guess that you wouldn't need to reapply at all during the day."
1558,RID-X - Septic System Treatment 1-Dose Powder 9.8 Ounce,0/0,5.0,"have been using RIDX for 20 yrs. Have only have had to have our septic system pumped three times within that time. Have tried other product once, was not happy. Have told all my neighbors about this product, hoping they are using it, but watched three of them have to have their septic pump dug up, along with their yard. Very happy to be able to have RIDX delivered to my home! No more ""OMG! I forgot the RIDX! "". Thank you, Mrs. Beverly Lacey"
1559,Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets,0/0,5.0,"I have an older dog {12 years old} with hip dysplasia and a younger dog {4 years old} that just had knee/patella surgery. My older dog had difficulty going outside and going up and down the porch onto the grass. After 4 weeks of taking Dasuquin w/ MSM he is no longer struggling and running around like he was 6 years ago! My younger dog has been taking this since her surgery 5 weeks ago and it has helped her to recover 4 weeks ahead of schedule. She is running around like nothing happened!This product is worth every penny and will help your dog {and cat} with joint/arthritis issues and recovery from surgery. It is the same product as you would receive from your veterinarian just without the prescription & added cost. This is a product that can help any dog/cat too for preventative purposes, to help them maintain joint health & flexibility their entire life.I will continue to give each of my dogs the maintenance dose of Dasuquin w/ MSM going forward and will be using Amazon to order it. I have seen how well this works with my two ""babies"" and would recommend this for anyone who has been looking for a joint supplement for their beloved dog or cat."
1560,L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System,1/2,1.0,"This product did nothing to my hair. It didn't lighten it at all, just made it kinda shinier...slightly. it also damaged it. My hair, which was smooth and silky before, turned crunchy. Also, the fumes are so strong and I got a little bit of formula on my skin, well it BURNED!"
1561,"Champion # C11 Hard Rubber 7"" Styling Comb",0/0,5.0,I ordered this comb to replace a metal comb that finally lost some teeth. It is very good & is good replacement for my other comb. I am totally satisfied
1562,Malibu C Swimmers Action Shampoo (1 Bottle - 9 oz),0/0,3.0,"I bought this to try to remove yellow build up on my hair due to well water and copper pipes. I don't think it has really worked to remove the yellow, but the discoloring is not getting worse, so maybe the shampoo is helping. The shampoo cleans my hair nicely and has a fresh citrus smell. Overall it's a decent shampoo, but I don't think it's removing the yellow from my hair."
1563,Coco Wheats-Hot Cereal 28 oz - 6 Unit Pack,0/0,5.0,You can not find this item in the eastern part of Pennsylvania. I went to Pittsburgh at the beginning of the year and saw this item in a grocery store and bought 2 boxes. I could not believe it because I thought they stopped making it. We moved to the Philadelphia area about 30 years ago. I decided to order some from Amazon and I was glad I did. I love this cereal. I am 60 years of age but I love my coco wheats.
1564,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,4.0,THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT MY 1 YR OLD GREW OUT OF IT VERY QUICKLY. I GUESS KIDS NOW DAYS ENJOY MORE AN iPad OR TABLET. GREAT TOY FOR IT'S VALUE!
1565,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Soccer Ball,0/0,4.0,"I bought this after getting my two 50+ pound dogs the football. The only problem I've had with it, is it is starting to rip where there is a manufactured hole for making the ball. That seems to be the spot my one dog likes to pick up the ball from. Other than that, it is providing plenty of exercise for them!"
1566,North States Superyard Play Yard,0/0,4.0,loved how its colorful and u can fold it and carry it but its hard to fold it sides overall its a pretty big play pen
1567,"HeadSlick Shave Cream, Mentholated, 8 oz.",0/0,5.0,"Title for Review says it all! Use with all HeadBlade products and you'll be very happy! My husband is ""BBC"""
1568,Dml Dml Daily Facial Moisturizer Spf 25,0/0,5.0,This product is great for all skin types even people who suffer from acne especially cystic acne. When dealing with acne and the harsh chemicals you use trying to deal with acne this lotion helps your skin repair.I use the orange on ewith spf in the morning (also dounles as a primer ladoes) and the white one at night.It is amazing been using it for years. Better then any drug or high end retail brand.I oerfer it over Dermalogica too
1569,ONE STEP AT A TIME FILTER SW-1 Size,1/1,5.0,The quality of the filters is excellent. They come apart easily for cleaning. So far they're working very well. I'm up to the 90% filters and have noticed much less coughing and just feel better generally. I'm sure this will help me finally quit. Definitely recommend them for people who have trouble quitting.
1570,Life-Flo Firma Visage,0/0,5.0,"I love FirmaVisage!! I use it every morning, and it helps to keep my skin feeling soft and firm. Everyone in my family likes it, and my mother loves it so much that she frequently gives it as gifts!"
1571,Lemon Extract JR Mushrooms brand,1/1,5.0,"My Mom is a great biscotti baker, she has traditionally relied on McCormick/Schiling extracts. Since using the JR Mushrooms and Specialties extract her biscotti's tastes even better and aroma is unprecedented."
1572,Omron HEM 705 CP Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with Printer,0/0,2.0,I bought the Omron BP monitor based on my doctors office recomendation for this brand. I had been using a very old Sunbeam BP monitor with built-in printer and loved it but my doctors office put it up against theirs and noted it wasn't getting the same numbers claiming mine needed replacement. So I found the Omron HEM-705CP which has a separate printer provided. Also because of the large circumferance of my arms I separately ordered the Omron H-003D large cuff. I think Amazon should offer the option to order which ever size cuff needed at the same time as the monitor is purchased. I feel the separate printer provided is not nearly as convenient as having it built in. Also I thought it was inconvenient to have to go to a different vendor for the large cuff. To make matters worse not only is the cuff longer as it should be but it's also wider which in my case is a problem. The distance between my under arm and my elbow is shorter then the width of the cuff so the cuff goes under my arm and past my elbow. Besides this problem it is the usual velcro arrangement and because of the subsequent poor fit I either have to ask my wife to help put the cuff on or lately I have managed to leave the velcro attached in the same position and just slide it on and off without detaching the velcro each time. it's awkward. I'm sure the large cuff fits properly on people with a larger frame. Mt doctors office has seen how this fits and thinks it best if my wife helps me with the cuff each time. This is not always an option. Thank you doctors office for the Omron recomendation! lol
1573,Syringe Tray - 7 Compartment Yellow- Made in the Usa,0/0,4.0,"I bought this tray and two others like it for my 90 year old father who is diabetic. While he lives independently, it has been hard for him to remember to take insulin or even whether he has taken it leading to his taking a second dose. With these trays, I put out needles in 3 trays (one for each dose) and by the day of the week. He now is taking his insulin reliably. My wishes for this product are that the compartments closed with syringes in them and that it was labeled with days of the week."
1574,Avon Bubble Bath for Kids,0/0,1.0,"Sensitive skin may be a bit misleading. This has scent, freesia being one of them. For the allergy prone, it is a no go. Wish that it had stated it had scent in the description.NOTE to anyone ordering in California"
1575,Evriholder HR-STD Hi-Reach Cleaning Kit with 10-Foot Extension Pole,0/0,3.0,"I bought this item to clean the solar panels we had installed at the end of May. I wanted it because of the 10 foot length of the telescoping poles. Other reviews mentioned it not really being 10 feet. The one I got is that long. It came with a sponge/squeegee and two other attachments I wasn't really interested in. I used it once washing our truck which is pretty tall and was happy with the extension. This week I washed the solar panels. By the time I was through, the sponge head was half way out of the holder and totally useless. The squeegee works well and the pole length is what I need for these so I don't have to crawl around too much on the roof. I'll have to figure out something else for the sponge or get a replacement. I won't need it until next spring, but having that fall apart on the second use was a huge disappointment."
1576,My Little Sandbox Big Builder,0/0,5.0,"I love Amazon for their reviews. This is my first official review. Felt the need to share how much my son loves this sandbox. Creative, independent play inside or on the porch. He can't get enough of the construction trucks so this gave a new dimension. He has other trucks he puts in here also."
1577,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,1/1,5.0,"Thank god for this temporary concealer, without it I wouldn't be able to leave the house without feeling self-conscious about my thinning hair. I use a combination of the medium brown and dark brown. It takes a little practice, but you can make it really blend with the hair you have.I changed my review from 4 to 5 stars because this is the only temporary solution I can find to conceal thinning hair that actually works. Hair systems at salons that specialize in thinning hair are available, but if you are not ready to spend the money/time per year, and if you still have hair, this stuff really helps and works for men and women (I am a 33 year old female)."
1578,Pacific Health Accelerade,0/0,5.0,"Item exactly as described, good quality, good Value. This is second purchase. Will buy again as good fast service was a plus. Better than store sports drinks. It really helps overcome my muscle cramps caused by diuretic in blood pressure medicine."
1579,MRM TribuPlex 750,0/0,5.0,"Did some reading on guys losing testosterone as they age and my hubby is 48 and I think he was feeling some of that (from listening to him describe the feeling); when he was not tired and getting his rest, he could already ""hit it like a rock star"" in the bedroom but...after trying this product, he told me he feels a BIG difference! I think it varies per person based on their t-levels and what they are taking in addition to this product (but that is just my guess); for us it's a winner! He says he feels more alive and I can certainly tell his mood is better. He seems to me to be like a younger man and we have more enjoyable conversations as a result (although that's not my favorite part...wink, wink); since I'm enjoying the bedroom activities as well being that much more fun, it's win-win for us! So, I'm on here ordering a second bottle now for him; it's only been about a month and it only took about a day or two before my guy noticed the difference (and by the way, he started off taking just one and says that 2 a day is best for him; think it is wise to start slow and then go up if your doctor says it's okay and the man feels comfortable with it)! We like this product and thank you, to the guys who reviewed it. I felt they helped my hubby decide if he wanted to give it a try and he's VERY glad he did; so am I! Signed, a very pleased, a little bit sore and truly loving it, Wifey! :)"
1580,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,"My review title says it all! Great educational toy, and great fun for a 8 years old. He played with it since he was 7 year old when he received this as his birthday gift."
1581,Original UNO Card Game,0/0,4.0,"This product is good, I like it so much, I might buy more of this game for my friends because they like it too"
1582,Disney Easy Grasp Flatware,0/0,5.0,This is the best fork and spoon set that I've tried! My 20 month old can handle them perfectly. Will be buying more!
1583,Lovely Eau de Parfum for Women by Sarah Jessica Parker,0/0,1.0,I do not like this fragrance. Smells cheap and to me its not good! Test at a store before buying! It may smell good on some people I guess.
1584,Natures Alchemy Pure Essential Oil Clove Bud,0/0,5.0,I actually mix a little bit of this with orange oil and put it in my diffuser and it smells wonderful.
1585,"Suave Cocoa Butter Shea Body Lotion Unisex Body, 18 Ounce",0/0,5.0,This was a blessing for my pregnancy! I used it all up till I was about 7 1/2 months pregnant (because I ran out) and I had NO stretch marks what so ever and I just put it all over my belly and hips before I went to bed or when my stomach felt itchy and it did wonders.. Wish I woulda ran to the store for another bottle because after a couple weeks of thinking I'm not going to get any stretch marks BAM there they were! I was a petite girl before the pregnancy then during gained about 50 lbs and still waiting for my little girl now. The product works wonders! Get it and don't stop using it!!!!
1586,American Baby Company Cotton Terry Contoured Changing Table Cover,0/0,5.0,Great basic colorCan't go wrong with this. Good quality for price. Would purchase again for sure. Cheapest price I found yet still good quality.
1587,Mirra-Coat Nutritional Supplement - 1 pound powder,0/0,5.0,This stuff works great to help keep my show dogs in shape. I have long haired dogs and their hair grows much faster with this product.
1588,Green Pet Aspen Supreme Pellets Pet and Bird All Natural Litter/Bedding,0/0,5.0,"I use this product for my angora rabbit's litter box. It doesn't get caught in her long fur, and it clumps pretty well after she pees in it. The clumped pee can turn into ""sawdust"" after a long enough time. Very easy to scoop out with a standard litter scooper. Also, the litter hides/absorbs the odor of the pee very well, compared to other beddings I had tried."
1589,Malem Ultimate Selectable Bedwetting Alarm with Vibration - Royal Blue,11/20,1.0,"The beeping part comes with a plastic stick and an array of buttons to program. You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out. You will have to open the unit and use the stick to change the music.We lost the stick, so now we are having difficulty with the product. Anyway, the product is not working even after 3 weeks. We have broken the easy clip and had to pay for replacements which in my opinion are not worth it.I was waking up 3 times a night and cleaning the sensor with a toothbrush as recommended. In one week, it's all rusty and potentially dangerous. Nope, this isn't going to work for us."
1590,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/0,3.0,"It works great for the first 6 months, but than it begins to become more weak. I found I had trouble with it holding a charge or the speed of the blade. The plastic pivot points used to open the head for cleaning are weak, mine broke earlier this week after 9 months of sporadic use. Was actually going to buy another one until I saw the price is now 25$. I'll hold off or buy a different kind."
1591,"Little Lamb Sheep 17.72"" by Hansa",0/0,5.0,I purchased this toy to use as a prop in a crib for a retail store location. I was expecting it to be cute by the pictures but when I received it was even more surprised by how soft and cuddly it is. The pictures do not do it justice - it is so cute - it is made from a very soft fabric that could probably not stand a lot of abuse but I would purchase this again just not for an infant or really small child.
1592,Viva Cream,0/0,1.0,nothing more than vapo rup. hot menthol.used buned us both ky product much better. not for us. will not try other menthol products.
1593,"Better Than Bouillon, No Beef Base, Vegetarian, 8 oz.",0/0,3.0,"This product is extremely concentrated, so take care to dilute as recommended, if not even more than recommended. The taste is very beef broth like."
1594,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,The polish was nicely packaged and also it came on time. It came as described and the polish was bend new.
1595,Bassinet Waterproof Mattress Protector - Size 17x31,0/0,4.0,"This is a fine product, but not really necessary. It provided some cushioning in the bassinet more than anything else. I had a mattress, this mattress pad, a sheet, and then a Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Waterproof cover, which was easy to change out whenever it got wet. So a waterproof mattress pad wasn't needed. But if you want to add a little cushion but still have a relatively firm surface for the baby, this is a good option."
1596,Alex fashion weave loom with fluffy yarn ages 7+,3/3,4.0,The brand of the weave loom I purchase is different but the contents is exactly the same. Rainbow color yarn balls and the wooden loom. I purchase it bcuz I am always looking to expand my crafting skills and enjoy trying new things. With winter around the corner I wanted to learn different ways of making a scarf for Christmas gifting besides knitting and crochet. So I bought this wooden loom. I must admit it's a bit pricey but sorta worth it. The instructions aren't very detailed but YouTube has loom weaving vids that help make instructions alot more clearer to understand. I had to knock one star off bcuz of that and the fact that the box states 75 yards of yarn but really it's only good for making one scarf. Good thing I have a large stock of yarn and also it's kinda difficult to make a scarf bcuz the length of your woven item is short so the way you make a scarf is to weave up to the top of the loom then sew several pieces together to make it into a scarf length. It's really tedious and this loom is probably best only to make potholders or small pouches but not scarves or anything of that sort. Overall I think it's an okay gift to purchase but keep in mind if the gift receiver doesn't have much patience or unable to sit for long periods this may not be the best gift as it's very time consuming and requires lots of patience sitting on your caboose.*EDIT

Next I took after 5hours in 3PM, and I went to lunch half an hour after. Nothing happend...I was hungry as usual and thats like every 3-4 hours if I eat around 500kcal per meal, and I eat 4-5 times per day with snacks. Around 2000-3000kcal per day.

1599,Guardian Gear Pet Rain Pet Jacket - Blue,1/1,1.0,"Really wish this had worked out. The smell is absolutely horrible. We hung it outside in the fresh air under our patio umbrella for 3 days. The smell is so strong, it still stinks up the entire house & gives me a headache. Tried washing it in the machine on gentle. Still smells like gasoline. When is the deadline to return it? We cannot keep this in the house."
1600,Hypafix Dressing Retention Tape,0/0,5.0,"I am an insulin pump wearer. The adhesive on my Omni Pod insulin pump is OK if you don't move around much or sweat. I work in construction and am physically active outside of work. This tape holds my insulin pump solidly in place. I have even caught it on doors getting in and out of my car. Have used lots of other tape, this is the best."
1601,Avalon Organics Conditioner Strenthening Peppermint -- 11 fl oz,0/0,5.0,"I have only used this product for about a month, but I Love this conditioner. hair feels stronger and more manageable. Would recommend."
1602,Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Nipple Protector,0/0,5.0,"I ordered both these and the Medela shields and the Avent came in first. We had had trouble bfing since we came home from the hospital and were dealing with poor latching, tongue thrust and pumping every 2 hours! I had resigned myself to formula feeding when a L&D nurse and close friend suggested these. We tried them out as soon as we got them and the feeling of relief and success brought me to tears as soon as my baby started nursing. I am afraid I'll lose them, so I plan on ordering a lot more just to have some in standby. I've read a lot from lactation consultants about how these hurt breastfeeding, but at this point I am just grateful that she is nursing."
1603,Walkabout Harness - Medium/Large,2/2,5.0,"Absolutely the best harness for dogs that still have some function left in their hind legs. I have an 11 yr old blue merle collie who has mobility issues. I've been using this for about 6 weeks and as soon as I put it on and help my dog to his feet, he's ""up and running""!! I've noticed better muscle tone, a renewed interest in his walks and an allover improvement in him. It really gives the amount of support needed, I only have to hoist him to his feet and then keep a very slight pressure so as to allow him to still walk on his own. In the event he trips, I have control of his back end and he doesn't fall anymore. When he tires, I'll give a little more support to him in order for him to make it back home. His walks have gotten longer, and the other day, he even got up on his own. I'm hoping I will see more improvement in this area, but even if he doesn't ever reliably get himself up anymore, this harness has been worth it's weight in gold. I believe it's extended his life as I see a different attitude in him. I've used other harnesses, this is definitely the best!!!"
1604,Flora Udos Choice Oil Blend,0/0,5.0,"I take two capsules each day to regulate me. The capsules are rather large, but they are easy to swallow gel capsules. A friend recommended this product to me several years ago, and I've been using it since. The friend is a nutritionist and she said it would remove toxins in my body."
1605,Lady-Comp Fertility Monitor - Fahrenheit,3/3,5.0,"I have been using Lady Comp for over a year to avoid pregnancy. I started using it after my first child was born, and it was a lifesaver during the erratic first few months of my body adjusting back to ""normal"" post-pregnancy, even during breastfeeding and very irregular sleeping patterns. We recently decided to use it to help us conceive again, and we were successful on the first try! Definitely recommended. Only side effects with this are patience through the red light days and the ability to relax knowing that you're in control without hormones, rings, etc, etc."
1606,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,3.0,"Littmann Classic II SE stethoscope was received. Postage took longer than expected by a week, but that could be because I live in Darwin. The color is NOT AT ALL like the picture, tubing is very dark green and metal ear pieces are gold not silver. Makes the whole thing look very mismatched not at all pretty like it displays in the picture. Slightly disappointed as this is my very first stethoscope but I do not have 6 weeks plus to wait to get one that I am happy with. Maybe the description/photo should be amended?"
1607,Whole Life Pet Pure Meat All Natural Freeze Dried Chicken Breast Treats 4 oz,1/1,5.0,"I was giving my cats the Whisker Lickin's treats but wanted to give them something healthier. They love this freeze dried chicken. I rehydrate the chicken in some warm water for a few minutes and my cats go crazy for it. Nothing added, just chicken._______If you belong to Amazon Prime be sure the item in your cart is a Prime item. I missed it on this one bought from Gulf Coast Pet Supplies which was not Amazon Prime."
1608,Fantasma Toys Dice Cloning - Over 10 Illusions,0/0,5.0,"This is one of the perfect magic effects for magicians at any level, particularly young beginning magicians.Producing the main effect is simple with little preparation needed. It is very visual effect and can be shown from virtually all angles except below. Alone, it's a fast trick, but it can also be incorporated into a routine with some slight of hand. It takes less than a minute to reset the trick. It's built to last for years, but it can be easy for kids to lose the small dice.I bought it for less than $7, which was a great deal for one of the best effects in the Fantasma collection."
1609,Eau Du Soir Eau de Parfum for Women by Sisley,1/1,5.0,I have been eyeing this product for quite awhile. I finally bit the bullet and ordered this wonderful fragrance. I was not sure what I was going to get- however it met all my expections and more. It was everything that was promised. Wonderful packaging- beautiful bottle and the contents were fabulous. The fragrance is long lasting especially when layered with the Eau du Sour body cream by Sisley.Thank you Amazon- again.Shannon Pera
1610,Bruce Half Gallon Hardwood/Laminate Floor Cleaner Refill,0/0,5.0,"The product was delivered in an Armstrong Floor Cleaner Bottle, and I was skeptical, as my Bruce hardwood floors have been cloudy and show footprints with other cleaners. The seller said that ""it's the same liquid in the bottle."" They're right, and it's great!"
1611,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"I read some reviews complaining about ""horrid"" smell, and really felt kind of bad for this product. It's really not that bad. I bought the package, and it smells exactly like Valerian is supposed to smell"

1613,"Claire and the Unicorn happy ever after 13"" Soft Toy",0/1,3.0,"I bought Capricorn to go with the book for my granddaughter (Claire - 6 yrs old) for Christmas. I know she will love both! I hesitated buying the unicorn, but the price went down a little so I decided it was worth it to have the toy that went with the book. I'm disappointed with the look and feel of the mane and tail (a coarse, not very attractive material that will fall apart if brushed), and I had to fix one eye that had a black thread running from the eye and attached to the neck. An obvious slip through quality control! My granddaughter will be thrilled, but I'm not sure how the mane and tail will look after much play."
1614,CytoSport Cytomax Sport Energy Drink,0/0,3.0,"Been using Cytomax for 5 years now & have been very satisfied . . . until now. Tried Accelerade 4 years ago, but whey, a dairy product in Accelerade, caused stomach cramping, which was why I preferred Cytomax. Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax. Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey. For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey. Who knows?I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula. As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon."
1615,"100% Whey, Chocolate Mint 5 lb",0/0,5.0,"I've read a lot of reviews and some complain about it not tasting like chocolate. No it doesn't taste like a bar of chocolate, its not suppose to. To me the taste is kind of like ovaltine. It mixes well in a shaker , I don't have any lumps. I usually make it using almond milk which adds flavor and some thickness. I really like the taste but don't compare it to a milk shake."
1616,Goldwell Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"This is a great product that actually penetrates the hair shaft and forces the outer cuticle to lay flat.I have very dry, extremely thick, coarse hair. My cosmetician recommended Kerasilk to me years ago and I've been using it ever since.Kudo's to Kerasilk from this ""hay head"" gal needing to tame the mane."
1617,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,1/1,5.0,"It's very mild (though not tear-free) lathers up really well, and makes me feel clean. I bought this also in bar-form, and think I will continue to buy bars, as they might be a bit cheaper and last longer, but that's not a failing of this product, just a personal preference."
1618,Buster Food Cube Interactive Dog Toy (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,I've been very happy the the cube. We received it before it was supposed to which was great! We have a 20lb Dachsund/Terrier/Beagle Mix. Seems to be a decent size but he can pull the whole thing in his mouth so we are trying to teach him to smack it around instead of just chewing on the whole thing. The crazy guy has also figured out how to pull the cork part open. We were recommended this from our trainer and she said she has never had a dog figure that out. It only took him about 20 mins to do so now we just watch him very carefully. I wish I could find a medium size but I'm not sure they make one in the size I need. I still give it a five star because I can finally eat a meal in peace.
1619,Nature's Way Pomegranate Standardized Extract,0/0,4.0,I use this product in combination with other supplements to naturally help the prostate. The item arrived early and as described.
1620,Zillionz Talking Cash Register,1/1,1.0,Received the first cash register and it did not work. Returned it and got a second one which also did not work. Returned the second one for a refund.
1621,"Trojan Magnum Condoms, Lubricated, 36 Condoms (Pack of 2)",0/0,4.0,"Loved the price on these condoms you can't get them that cheap anywhere, but when opened individually there is a rubber smell that I just do not like."
1622,"Vanilla, Amber, Musk Perfume Oil -- 1/3 oz Roller Bottle",0/0,5.0,Love the Amber scent. Its all I have worn for perfume for years. Its so natural and nonperfumey smelling. I get compliments all the time.
1623,"Gustaf's Dutch Licorice Coins, 6 Plastic containers - 7-Ounce each",0/0,5.0,"This traditional Dutch licorice is chewy and on the salty side--the way the Dutch like them. They 're shaped like Euro coins. This ""drop"" is very satisfying, but doesn't taste like the American licorice straws."
1624,"Clif Bar Builder's Bar, 2.4-Ounce Bars",0/0,5.0,"As others say, get the Chocolate Mint. It's delicious. One bar is a 20 gram meal substitute. I love them and have one every day. I get them on subscription. I may actually get more every month."
1625,"Johnson & Johnson Flexible Fabric Adhesive Bandages, 1 x 3, 100 per Box",0/1,2.0,"I love these Flexible Fabric Bandaids. WHAT HAPPENED??The batch I got last week at the local pharmacy is falling apart!The fabric is unraveling on the ends, and it starts about an hour after you apply the bandaid.Have they started to make these overseas? Or have they changed the manufacturing site to someplace new?These have always been GREAT bandaids..but now I may have to try an off-brand or store brand to get a better quality.I also don't like the new ""pad"" that's quilted. It has some ""plasticy"" coating, and it tends to fall/slide out of the bandaid after a couple hours.Why'd they take a GREAT product like this and screw it up?I'm really ticked."
1626,"Farmer's Market Foods Organic Canned Pumpkin, 15-Ounce Cans",1/1,5.0,"We're huge pumpkin lovers in this house, but it's one of the few things I prefer canned versus fresh. This brand is excellent. There is a huge difference between this brand versus Libby's, or any store brand for that matter. Farmer's Market is thicker and has a much stronger pumpkin taste. And to top it off, it's not only organic but now the label says ""BPA free lining"" (I don't remember seeing that in the past, so maybe it's a new thing for the company?) which is a huge plus."
1627,Mavala Switzerland Correcteur for Nail Polish Nail Polish Removers,0/0,5.0,"This is the best idea for a person who does their own nails. If you don't have a steady hand, no problem. Any overlaps are easily removed."
1628,Futuro Stabilizing Back Support,0/0,5.0,"I recently purchased this product (I am a 62 year old male) to replace another Futuro lower back brace that I have worn out. Futuro no longer makes the brace I was using. This brace stabilizes a larger area of the lower back than the previous one I owned. When I first received this item I was skeptical that it would work as well, but have been surprised that it is an improvement over the older brace and so far it seems a bit more comfortable to wear. I have spinal stenois in my lower lumbar region caused by disc degeneration above and below L4 (comfimed by recent MRI). I need additional support from a brace like this for golfing, power walking and doing chores around my house that may irritate my lower back. This is not a brace for heavy lifting, but for giving your lumbar region extra support and keeping the vertebra lined up. Golfing is one thing I do that can really bother my lower back, but I can walk 9 holes in hot humid weather and not end up having a sore back the rest of the day. As I use this item through the next months I will update my review with any pros or cons that I have about this brace. However at this time I would say that if you need lower back support for spinal issues I would highly recommend that you try this item. The cost is modest for the benefits as far as I am concerned. One comment I would make is about the sizing, make sure you measure yourself around your naval area and do not use your pants waist size. I have a 34 inch waist and the small/medium size just fits me. I do believe that the material will streatch over time, as did the previous Futuro back stabilizing brace I replaced."
1629,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"This booster is perfect. It cleans easily, 6 month (now 9 month) baby loves it. This chair travels well but it also used everyday at grandma's house. I spent hours trying to be sure I bought something that baby would be comfortable in, but was also easy to clean and use. This chair is perfect! There is no cloth to need to wash, it wipes down easily. The best part, you can't beat the price!"
1630,"Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 3 Count, 2 Ounce Bottles",1/6,1.0,first off and will be very brief and get to the point.1. do not buy if you want it to fix hair line- it is only designed to work for the back of head (vertex)2. it didnt work for me and used it faithfully as instructions showed3. leves white cracks in head and made scalp look an ADDTIONAL 20 YEARS OLDER ITS WRINKLY4. ROGAIN WORKED MUCH BETTER ITS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT AT LEAST WORKS PROPERLY AND REGROWS HAIR AND NOT JUST FOR ONE SPECIFIC SPOT
1631,"Premium Cat Tails Litter CAC00031 Premium Choice Extra Scooping Litter Jugs, 16-Pound",3/3,4.0,"Not sure which is easier to clean...the dust from regular clay or these crystals. Still, the odor control is so good that I would say it is overall a good choice."
1632,Spectrum Essentials Cod Liver Oil,1/1,5.0,"if you took vegetable oil and took a lick and add a little lemon, that is what this stuff tastes like. it's clean and it's not offensive. plus, it's about a 1,000 mg of Omega3 fatty acids per 1 teaspoon serving. this bottle contains 47 servings."
1633,Mendota Products Slip Lead,0/0,4.0,We've used this slip lead several times and I like that it is soft yet strong. My dog and I are in dog training classes and this leash was recommended by others in the class.
1634,"Philips AVENT BPA Free Nipple Protector, Small",0/0,5.0,I love these nipple shield. It has made breastfeeding bearable. I like that it has more skin to skin and only covers the nipple.
1635,Revell 1:77 Ford Tri Motor,0/2,1.0,"I WAS VERY DISAPPONTED AFTER L OPENED MY PACKAGE AND SAW THAT L WAS ONLY MAILED JUST THE WING, INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTHING ELSE.THIS IS JUST SAD."
1636,Clinique Long Last Soft Shine Lipstick,0/0,4.0,"Since my lips tend toward dryness, I have a difficult time with ANY long lasting lipstick, but Clinique's version is only SLIGHTLY drying and thus a good choice for me to wear to work. As another reviewer stated, Blushing Nude isn't as pink as it sounds, but it IS a nice neutral tone that tends toward a natural brownish pink without overpowering my lighter coloring."
1637,"simplehuman Under-Counter Pull Out Can, 30 Liters / 8 Gallons",0/0,5.0,"COuldn't be happier with the product. SHipment arrived on time. And fits my cabinet perfectly fine. Its also very easy to install. My husband put it up together in less than 15 mins. Love it!!!No more carrying the sink leftover to the ""trash"" and making mess. Its a bliss to have a perfect under the cabinet trash can."
1638,Matrix Biolage Ultra-Hydrating Balm 16.9 oz,0/0,1.0,"I've used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I'd now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it's time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don't fix it if it ain't broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)"
1639,Make Up For Ever Face & Body Liquid Makeup,1/1,5.0,I keep coming back to this foundation after trying other brands. If you are looking for full coverage this is not for you. This is very sheer and does not make your pores look big.
1640,Burt's Bees Herbal Deodorant,1/1,5.0,"My Teva rubber sandals started to smell, despite being scrubbed. Even an overnight soaking in disinfectant (Dettol and water) was ineffective. I thought I was going to have to toss them out when I came across an article that recommended Burt's Bees deodorant spray for getting the smell out. IT WORKS!!! The herbal, minty smell is a bit strong at first but way better than foot odor. I now spray my Tevas liberally with Burt's Bees before each wear. There's not even the hint of foot or sandal odor ever since. Great product!!"
1641,"Jell-O No-Bake Peanut Butter Cup Dessert, 16.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)",0/0,3.0,"After opening package I was a little disappointed at how small it was. However, it was a great project to involve my grandson in as no oven was involved. It was very easy to prepare. Once taking my first few bites and tasting its richness, I realized there was plenty."
1642,Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Wet/Dry Straightening Iron,0/0,5.0,This flat iron is awesome! My daughters and I now own 3 of them and would not usae another flat iron. Wet/ Dry feature is truly a life saver!
1643,"Hartz Bird Diet Food for Large Birds, 8-Pound",1/1,2.0,"The large bird seed is getting to be like mediumbird seed. What happened to the peppers, peanuts,and pellets that used to be in it? The seeds are very small. My birds don't like it."
1644,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,This a very dramatic/sparkly red which I have simply fallen in love with. I definitely plan to wear it frequently and especially during the upcoming holiday season. I will definitely order again.
1645,"Drawstring Yard Bag, Clear 39 Gal",3/3,3.0,"These bags are as advertised but I failed to note (it's not obvious) how thin they are. They are too thin for all but the lightest of loads, say leaves that have not been mulched and without any twigs. Otherwise, they easily tear."
1646,Tea Rose By Perfumers Workshop For Women. Set-edt Spray 4 oz & Body Lotion 4.4 oz,1/1,5.0,This is so wonderful. I have gotten so many compliments on it. Mind you I haven't tried the lotion but the perfume is awesome.
1647,Dr. Bronner'S Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile,0/0,5.0,"Met my expectations, cleaned my dreads better then the bottled soap. Made more suds like a shampoo. Make sure you put it in a soap container to keep it from getting all gross."
1648,"Hefty Easy Grip 9 Ounce Cups (Red/Blue), Case Pack, 50 Count Packs (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Exactly as pictured. I bought them to put in a chain link fence to create words (school project). The 12 oz. size fit my fence @ home, but not @ school. These 9 oz. cups fit well, but don't stay in as well in the wind. Nice product. Shipping was slow."
1649,Original Himalayan Crystal Salt Inhaler,3/3,5.0,"I was skeptical that something so simple could be effective. After suffering with an allergy-related cough for months, I decided to give it a chance. After only a few days of using the inhaler, my cough has disappeared. Whether it is all in my head, coincidence, or the salt inhaler, I guess I don't know. I do know that for the first time in six months I am cough-free. I whole hearted recommend you try it if you are having upper respiratory issues. The seller was also great! Quick shipping, etc. I am a satisfied customer."
1650,PLASTIC TEST TUBES W/ CAPS 12/PK,0/0,5.0,Great item! I filled these test tubes with tiny candies to put in the loot bags for my son's Mad Science Birthday Party :-)
1651,Fiberchoice Prebiotic Fiber Chewable Tablets Sugar Free Assorted Fruit 90 Tablets (Pack of 2),0/0,5.0,Fiber Choice has been my choice for fiber supplements since my doctor recommended it 5 years ago. It's easy to chew and tastes good. The sugar free variety fits with my diabetic control. A great product.
1652,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"pampers is the best! We tried other brand (maybe the no. 2 brand), but we came back to pampers and would not try any others."
1653,Exotic Pearl G-Spot Glass Dildo 8 Inch (colors may vary),1/1,3.0,I like the firmness and that it is easy to clean up and sanitize but It just doesn't have enough girth to do anything for me.....
1654,Ginger People Original Ginger Chews 3oz Bag,0/0,5.0,"These are amazing for me.If you don't like chewy sticky candies or spicy food...then don't get them. Also, Trader Joes has this bag for $7. Don't buy on here. Crystallized ginger is a joke and way worse for you as far as sugar intake goes. And the white sugary powder is so that the paper doesn't stick to the candy. That's how they are packaged. The packages still stick to some candies, but so do wrappers to starbursts, sugar daddy's, and every other chewy candy product. It's a fact of life. If you have a real complaint about this product, it's just because your own personal taste buds just don't like it. The real complaint is that amazon sells these for more than double the price. No thank you. I'm giving 5 stars to this company, not to amazon. Geez. Get a grip amazon, it's just candy."
1655,BeautyBlender Sponge,0/0,5.0,"best sponge blender I tried love it, is really soft and blend the foundation really well and the price was a very good price compare to other websites"
1656,"Promax 12 per pack, 2.64 oz. each",0/0,5.0,I purchased the Promax Nutrition Chocolate Mint bars as an alternative to the smaller Atkins diet bars I usually eat as I'm diabetic. These bars are almost twice the weight and at 38 carbs are only good between meals or can be used as meal replacements. The taste is outstanding with a chewy dark chocolate mint flavor without the sugary taste of milk chocolate bars. Using Amazon's subscribe & save plan you can have them for the bargain price of a bit over $1.00 per bar along with the usual quick checkout and delivery time frames.
1657,"Reflections Heavyweight ""Looks Like Silver"" Disposable Flatware for 40 with BONUS Pack of 40 Forks - 160 Pieces in All",0/0,4.0,"So I had taken the flatware out of its' box and it was on my kitchen counter, when my neighbor walked in, looked at it, and asked why I was using my grandmother's good silverware for a casual baby shower! Now, granted, she was a bit across the room, but still! My only comment on the negative side, but it's a quibble of the product wording, is that it is by no means ""heavyweight."" Doesn't feel any sturdier than any good quality plastic ware. But I'm happy with it."
1658,"Konriko Creole Seasoning, 6-Ounce Shakers (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"This product was discontinued in my shopping area. I found it on the web and ordered a case. This is by far one of the best cajun seasonings I have ever found and I've done a lot of shopping for different flavors for my chili and beaf jerky. Every time I make a new batch of jerky people say that the last batch was much better. Usually the only difference was that I left out my old standby Konriko. I have turned every meat I can get into jerky. I know a little bit about what people like. Spicy, not hot."
1659,Zero Carb Isopure,1/1,5.0,I always have some on hand but it's mandatory when shedding the wet weight. I prefer ketogenic in my first few weeks of serious fat loss coming out from a bulk to clean my system from high carbohydrate dieting so to eliminate anythign from my whey is beneficial. It's an absolute must for me when preparing for competition. Having an easily available stream of amino acids with little GI breakdown helps keep water weight out and feed my system to keep lean. Not to mention no artificial sweeteners which can make or break your abs for a show/photo shoot. I have my shakes preworkout as some amino acids have a positive cognitive effect in battling fatigue and having an energized feeling pre-training
1660,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I really enjoy this fun color and it didn't stain my nails like other polishes I bought on Amazon. Also arrived quickly.Not much else to say, it's polish after all!"
1661,"Nioxin Scalp Therapy System 1, Bionutrient Actives Scalp Therapy (select option/size)",0/0,5.0,I have been a return customer of Nioxin products for many yerars. My hair never felt as good as when I use the shampoo & conditioner.I do not use the conditioner on a daily basis as my hair does not require it.The shampoo has given my hair body & I use it monthly.Great products.

1664,Oreganol P73 Travel Shipper - 8 ml,2/2,4.0,"NOTHING beats Oreganol P73 for killing the common cold and knocking out a flu in just a day or 2.I've been preaching the benefits of Oreganol P73 for years now and when I saw these 8ml bottles, looking at the picture, I thought they were actually going to send the >12-bottle container pictured&lt;.Admittedly I thought the price was a bit low for 12 bottles, but in my defense, I couldn't tell from the picture the actual size of the bottles.My other reasoning was as ""samplers"", anyone who tries them would end up continually buying the product since it's that amazing, so a low priced ""sampler"" was a no-brainer!I wanted to sit the 12 of them on my file cabinet at work where those interested could finally try out what I've been praising for eliminating colds, flu's and other ailments.I only received ONE BOTTLE so I'm posting this review to warn others who may be misled by the product photo posted above.Again, NOTHING wrong with the product, just a bit misleading on what you get based on the photo shown.I'm keeping the bottle (of course) since it is a nice small size that fits into my briefcase easier than the usual bottle of P73 I carry with me daily.I was really looking forward however to setting this out for people to try since it's great stuff..."
1665,"Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces",0/0,3.0,"We have an Alaskan Malamute puppy who goes nuts for this stuff. We put the bottle on the coffee table and I caught him trying to chew on the cap to get it open. I tried spraying it in his mouth when I caught him chewing on some things and he did not react like he hated it; in fact, he started licking at the bottle. I had to return it. Make sure you spray some in your dog's mouth when he does something bad, before spraying this stuff on your cords and other possessions, in case he likes it! I gave it three stars because we've had a few dogs over the years and the others hated it (all except for a shepherd mix), so it was mostly successful as a training aid. It just won't work for all dogs!UPDATE"
1666,Jake Musical Mobile,0/0,1.0,"The only good thing about this mobile is that it matches the Lambs and Ivy Jake set. Other than that it is absolute garbage.The cheap plastic molding of the assembly scratched my $600 crib and it is still not very secure. The mobile squeeks while playing music and it plays virtually for about 2 minutes. Then you have to wind it again. This Item is really good at it's main purpose however, which is suckering you to pay $30 because you have the rest of the set. If this piece was included in the set, I would expect this kind of quality, selling it as an extra cost is ridiculous. The good reviews must be based on looks alone , avoid at all costs."
1667,"bareMinerals MATTE SPF 15 Foundation with Click, Lock, Go Sifter",1/1,1.0,"I used to use the original Bare Minerals, it covered well but it was too shiny. It didn't help that I have an oily T-zone. When I saw this product I thought it would be great since it's for oily skin, but I was wrong....so wrong. After about an hour, the makeup ""slides"" off of my nose and chin and clumps up, leaving bare spots. So of course I have to reapply to those areas, but it looks horrible since it's all clumped. There is no ""smoothing"" it back out. I ordered the fair shade but it's still too dark for me. This matte version does not cover well at all. I've tired with just the matte makeup, using with the Bare Minerals primer, and with concealer, but it still doesn't cover the redness on my skin. Oh, and if you have even the smallest wrinkles, it will cause them to stand out horribly. I will never waste my money on any of these products ever again."
1668,Burt's Bees Baby Bee Dusting Powder,0/0,5.0,I love this powder! It smells amazing and makes my baby's skin feel so soft! I use it at night to help with the wetness for over night cloth diapers and minor chafing he gets with his large thighs.
1669,Today's Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow,0/0,4.0,I bought the pillow once I was no longer able to sleep. The pillow helped a ton! I do wish the portion where your shoulder is would have been shaped a little different but other than that it was and is great.
1670,"POOF-Slinky 100 Metal Original Slinky in Box, Silver",0/0,1.0,"Very very disappointed. I bought this toy for my granddaughter's birthday thinking that she would get a kick out of seeing the slinky go down the stairs and it did not happen. What a dud. The slinky was not flexible. It was stiff, looks like it was cut in half and the color was a very dark metal color, was not at all like the slinky I remembered. The add was very misleading. To return the slinky for a refund will cost me more than what paid for it. Very disappointed."
1671,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",1/1,2.0,"My sister told me about this popcorn, saying it is the best she ever had. Wow, I must have gotten a bad batch. Mine is very dry, crumbly and hully. The kernals fall to pieces and have so many pieces in hull in them, they are impossible to eat. Will Not purchase again!"
1672,Climat By Lancome For Women. Parfum .47 Ounces,0/0,4.0,This is an old Fragrance by Lancome which has been discontinued and I was thrilled to discoverit at Amazon and to my amazement it is the same. I have received many compliments as it isso different from many of today's scents and suits me perfectly. I certainly hope it remainsavailable!
1673,Lipstix Lipstick Sealer,0/0,2.0,"In my opinion, Lipstix Lipstick Sealer does not work at all. Every time I have coffee, I have lipstick on the cups and I have to wipe it off. I used another product for 15 years. I am very disapointed in this product."
1674,"Imperial 715C Swing Arm Extension Mirror 8"" - Chrome",6/6,4.0,"This mirror works fine and extends nicely around our very large bathroom mirror.Seems well made although the mounting bracket of stamped metal is a little on the cheesy side. The instructions state to turn the mirror, not by flipping from one side to the other but by actually turning it on the pivot where it mounts to the arm. Pivoting the mirror is a little stiff and flipping causes the screws to back out. To solve both issues, I backed the screws out and applied a small dab of Loctite and re-screwed to a tension for flipping the mirror that held it nicely at the desired angle. Since there are not threads on the bracket, the screws now rotate with the mirror and don't back out. An easy fix, something they should do in manufacturing. Four stars because of the mounting plate and screw issue."
1675,StarMark Add-A-Link,0/0,1.0,"I ordered the ""add a links"" when I purchased two small collars, based on the advertising that they worked with the small collars. The packaging even states that they work with small collars. Not so! They are bigger and will not snap onto the small collars. Money wasted!"
1676,"Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces",0/0,2.0,"First of all. The spray doesn't come out like a mist. Its limited to about a 4 inch distance since the liquid comes out in a forced dripping sort of way. Other than that it works, but I would like it to actually spray to cover a wide area like cables and wires and not drip out."
1677,TeleBrands Deluxe Doggy Steps,0/0,1.0,"This product is difficult to put together, my little dogs will not go on it because of it's lack of sturdiness. A waste of money, do not recommend."
1678,Petmate Barn Home Dog House,0/0,5.0,"I would recommend this for anyone. I got this for my dog when he is misbehaving and needs a timeout outside. The top can come off for the summer, or be put on for the rainy seasons here. Its great."
1679,"Bachmann Trains 5""- 6"" Pine Trees - 6 Per Box",2/2,4.0,"I am building a train layout, and needed trees. The price, and quality is acceptable. I Would purchase this product again!"
1680,Nature's Way Red Raspberry,3/3,5.0,"I had painful, irregular periods since I was 13. When I was 30, my husband and I started trying to get pregnant and had no luck. My cycles were very irregular. After 3 months of taking the red raspberry leaf pills once a day, my cycles became regular and we conceived a little boy who is due in three weeks."
1681,Premier Jour Eau de Parfum for Women by Nina Ricci,0/0,5.0,"It is a beautiful aroma and I feel it is an elegant one, the price is right and I love the bottle."
1682,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,4.0,"Having purchased a new bed, we were concerned about the ease of our Yorkie getting onto the bed. We decided that the Pup stairs might be the answer. Our Yorkie is getting the stair process quickly. Although I think the steps seem slightly slippery, the dog manages just fine."
1683,Super Nail Fungi-Cide 1 oz.,0/1,2.0,"I was excited to get this product as I have issues with all toenails on one foot. Have been using over a month and no change in nail growth noted. I will continue to use, but not holding my breath."
1684,"Dibucaine Ointment 1% USP,Anesthetic Hemorrhoids Ointment - 1 Oz",0/0,5.0,Good stuff. Dibucaine Ointment relieved my PITA (caused by hemroids). I recommend it and will purchase it from Amazon. Was surprised Amazon carried medical products. The response in receiving the item was outstanding.
1685,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,2/2,5.0,"Sure Frontline Plus for Cats costs more than what you MIGHT be tempted to buy Over The Counter at the drug store or the Supermarket -- but those OTC products have killed or neurologically (seriously) damaged too many cats and dogs-- and I wonder why those OTC products are still being sold. As a new pet owner 20 yrs ago, I almost killed my cat with an OTC product-- I frantically called the vet immediately -- seconds after applying it and seeing my cat have a reaction -- and luckily all I had to do was put my cat under a warm shower and wash her off -- if I had waited any longer I would have had to take a very sick cat to the vet, with no guarantee of a full recovery.That being said, paying a little extra for Frontline For Cats is worth it -- in the long run you pay MUCH less than you would have to pay if you had to tke your cat to the vet for a life-threatening reaction to an OTC flea product(make sure you get a Cat product and not a Dog product as Cats' livers process chemicals differently than do dogs' livers- i.e., a cat CAN get poisoned by a dog product)Frontline Cat Plus starts working in (as I have observed) less than 24 hours-- make sure you apply it as indicated on the package. My Big Bad Baby Twinkle cat can turn her head almost 270 degrees, and she tries to lick it off the back of her neck, so I have to put a (soft) Elizabethan collar on her and monitor her for about 12 hours to make sure she doesn't walk into walls (that collar may impair her line of vision).Please DO montior your cat to make sure s/he does not have a (rare but it may happen) reaction to Frontline, but I have never seen that happen in all my 3 cats. At any sign of a reaction call the vet immediately.Other than that, when the fur dries, your cat is protected very well. Then it's up to you to remove the source of the problem - the fleas -- in blankets, bedding, on rugs, etc. Ihad to do that-- it was a chore but it certainly was worth it -- for me AND for my cat(s). If the infestatin is very heavy, please call your vet to see what else can be done. (I had to do that too)"

1687,Jobst Coverlet Large Finger Bandages 2 X 2 1/2,0/0,5.0,Custom made just for the finger tips. They cover your entire finger tip well and stay on. We have used about 10 bandages so far and they really work well.
1688,"Zadro Triple Vision Gooseneck Vanity and Wall Mount Mirror, Chrome Finish",0/0,2.0,"Item To heavy to mount on mirror or wall with suction cups provided. Item to heavy to carry on a plane in suitcase. I read some of the reviews before buying but still thought the item would work, but i was wrong."
1689,Traditional Medicinals Teas Breathe Easy Tea,0/0,5.0,"I steep in half the water for 15 min and drink it down. It certainly seems to open up my passage way, and moreso clears my chest fairly quickly. It's a simple, easy, fast remedy when you feel like 'heck' all over. I was shocked how it opened up my airways.. as if I took a shot of an inhaler. But HOW NICE, it was not! I didn't need to drink it all day either... a cup or two a day did me good on a typical congestive day. Try it at least once as an alternative to heavier drugs."
1690,Tresor By Lancome For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,I received this perfume as a birthday gift from my mom. The smell is so sophisticated It's clean and fresh. I feel grown and sexy when I wear this perfume.
1691,CytoSport Muscle Milk Light,0/0,5.0,"I have had a few different flavors of muscle milk light, and all of them taste delicious! the chocolate tastes like chocolate milk and the banana tastes like banana pudding! tastes great and no chalky after taste."
1692,E-Flite Gear Puller,0/0,3.0,"The product did not work properly. This is because the pins would not slide into the shaft on the gear puller. They would not slide in, because metal filings left over from the boring of the set screw hole were in the way. I had to force the largest pin into the shaft to knock lose metal filings. After that, the pins installed ok.The product was not manufactured properly and should NOT have been shipped. No quality control was involved whatsoever."
1693,CHAMPS ELYSEES For Women By GUERLAIN,0/0,5.0,"I have worn Champs Elysees for years! Customers have stopped and walked back to ask what I had on! A man said ""I want to buy this for my wife!"" A connection with the Tour de France when I wear this perfume! Cheers!"
1694,Spade Set for Pet Waste Removal,0/0,5.0,This product is an excellent product I use it not only for my dogs but around the yard and for all my other animals I live on a farm so you know how many animals I have.
1695,"ButterBuds Butter Flavored Mix, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Butter Buds are a dieters dream. Everything made with BBstaste better than buttery and I don't have to worry about the fat! Sinceusing BBs my cholesterol has returned to an acceptable leveland I'm eating more vegetables and actually enjoying them. Also, fish sautedwith a a BBs and lemon juice sauce tastes like something from a gourmet restaurant!"
1696,Hugo Boss Hugo,1/1,4.0,I bought this perfume last month and the smell is fantastic. I want to warn anybody who wants to purchase this product the smell only lasts for 1-2 hours and I was disappointed with that and I was hoping for more. If you are going to use it for a short period then that is OK otherwise look for something else.
1697,Enviro-Magic Mildew Stain Away Non-toxic Cleaner 32 Oz.,0/0,1.0,"I so much wanted Enviro-Magic to work, but it did not. I tried it in a shower, and nothing, absolutely nothing happened even though I scrubbed with a sponge. Same thing with my refrigerator that had grown black mildew in the folds of the sealer. In this case, I managed to scrub the mildew away with a sponge, but the same thing occurs when I only use soap and water. Also, this product does not prevent mildew from coming back. I hate to use bleach, and I wish there was a safe product out there that got rid of mildew, but this is not it."
1698,Hudson Voldyne Volumetric Exerciser,0/0,2.0,"I purchased 2 Voldyne Volumetric Incentive Spirometer 5000ML each $8.42 and I received a little cylinder with a red ball and a mouth piece. I posted a picture for everyone to see. This is not what the description says for this I give 2 stars. I wanted the one from picture, since I don't know what I am doing and there is no chart to help just a piece of paper that tells how to use it and a short explanation what is used for. This one advice you to account seconds and multiply the number above with the seconds. Should I inhale or should I count? I don't know what to do first lol."
1699,Classic Etch A Sketch Magic Screen,1/1,5.0,"This is a GREAT toy! It is exactly like the one that everyone grew up with. By moving the white knobs, horizontal and vertical lines as well as curves can be drawn, allowing the user to draw countless objects. The objects can be cleared by simply shaking the screen.The Etch A Sketch can be dropped and banged around without breaking. It is fun both for adults, as well as children, although it is probably better for the 5+ age group rather than the 3+ age group, as advertised. While children under 3 can use the Etch A Sketch, it is a bit too difficult for 3-4 year-old children to make interesting objects with the dials so that age group often gets bored with it.While the Etch A Sketch has no bells, whistles, or computerized parts, it seems to be the toy that kids keep coming back to. Its simplistic design actually keeps it from becoming tiresome. I very much appreciated the quietness of the toy.The Etch A Sketch is particularly good with children who need to develop hand muscles, as continuous use of the dials requires intricate hand movements. Also, it shows children the different objects that can be drawn simply by combining vertical and horizontal lines with curves."
1700,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/0,2.0,"I bought this for my daughter who is 1 month old. The moment I put her on it, I knew, she would not be comfortable.I think, this rocker is designed for kids 1 year and above but certainly not for infants."
1701,BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original,0/0,5.0,"My wife and I received the carrier a few months before our baby girl was born. We couldn't be happier with the fit, color, and comfort. Highly recommended!!! Even our cat likes to be carried in the BabyBjorn!"
1702,Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,"I have used Sonicare at home for many, many years but since I have retired and am traveling for extensive periods of time and could not charge my toothbrush, I purchased the battery operated Sonicare. Love my Sonicare and cannot do without it."
1703,F.A.S.T. Nisim FAST Shampoo & Conditioner 12 oz. each For FAST Hair Growth!,0/0,5.0,"just used this shampoo and conditioner combo for the first time today and my hair is very soft and there wasn't as much breakage as there usually is. i can't say too much about how much my hair grew since i just started today, but i will continue using this just because of how healthy my hair looks and feels."
1704,Neurosmith Jumbo Music Block,0/0,5.0,I bought this toy 14 years ago for my son when he was 1. He is blind and profoundly autistic. I also bought every music cartridge I could get my hands on so that we wouldn't have to hear the same 6 songs repeatedly. He is nearly 15 years old now and STILL plays with it! It still works. All the parts are in tact and the sound is still clear. He is very rough on his toys but all Neurosmith toys have survived extraordinary use and abuse.
1705,Maybelline Expert Eyes 100% Oil Free Eye Make-Up Remover - 2.3 fl oz,0/0,2.0,"I agree with one of the other reviewers...you have to wipe and wipe, and it STILL doesn't remove all the makeup! I guess I'll have to try a more ""oily"" one."
1706,Lovely Eau de Parfum for Women by Sarah Jessica Parker,0/1,1.0,Love SJP but was disappointed in her Parfum. Very common and one dimmensional; lacks sophistication and complexity. Didn't find it subtle and couldn't wait to shower it off. That's just one girl's opinion; I'm sure there are others who might feel differently....
1707,EHEIM Classic External Canister Filter with Media,0/0,4.0,"The filter itself works great but since I've never had a canister filter before, I had to rely on the instructions, and they were terrible. Also, the box that the filter came in said that the shut off valves weren't included with the filter, but they were. Same with the filter media. More was included than what was advertised on the box. I'm not complaining, but it created some confusion during setup."
1708,Kikkoman Instant Shiro Miso (White) Soup (3 Pockets) with Product Brochure and Pier Mall Home Recipes - 1.05 Oz,0/0,5.0,Hi! I'm pleased to have purchased Kikkoman Instant Shiro Miso. This soup is very easy to prepare. Simply add hot water and stir. Outer envelope contains 3 individual serving packets. Salt content might be on the high side for some users. Best to check product details. The soup does not taste salty. I would buy this miso soup again.
1709,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,"It took me several days to get the hang of this water flosser. I've never used one before, and there was a lot of splashing at first. But it works great, especially with a about 1/3 Listerine in the tank. Just make sure you rinse and run a cycle with just water afterwards to clean out the plumbing.After using this flosser daily for about a month, my dentist noticed a major difference. They also advised me to use string floss at least once a week, but they said it's really just a formality."
1710,HYPNOTIC POISON For Women By CHRISTIAN DIOR Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Sexy, sexy stuff, you ought to have to show I.D. to buy it:) It is the quintessential romantic scent. It smells like every deliscious thing to eat and then some. People will definitely notice this one and it is strictly for fall and winter evenings. Goes well with an expensive bottle of French wine and then use your imagination. Enjoy!"

1713,L'Heure Bleue Perfume by Guerlain for women Personal Fragrances,0/2,2.0,"I bought this a few years ago-not here- when I was first delving into the fragrance classics and this was so raved. About. Perhaps I got a fake, who knows, but the juice I received I would describe as just boring and nondescript as hell. You could wear it to the office and nobody would be offended, because it just smells like generic soap and powder. Subtle, yes, romantic, I don't think so. Reminds me a little of Shalimar without the personality or Lauren. Remember this came out before WW I, perhaps it was easier to excite people in the days before radio. I wore it a couple of times and I should give it away. Check the Salvation Army near you."
1714,Remington Tangle Tamer Wet/Dry - Cord or Cordless Convenience W/ On/off Switch,0/0,3.0,"I have Curly/Kinky hair that is transitioning to natural. My hair is thin but highly dense. The true length of my hair is 20 inches total. Of those, 6"" are natural, the rest is relaxed. I don't find it difficult to detangle as is, it is just very time consuming. I was in the market for something to reduce the time I spend at it and found this here on amazon. This comb does what it says it does"
1715,Giant Microbes White Blood Cell (Leukocyte) Plush Toy,0/0,5.0,I purchased a number of the giant microbes related to blood to keep in my office. I work for a national blood bank and I enjoy showing them to co-workers and blood donors. As a blood and platelet donor myself I think it's cool to have plush toy versions of components I donate.
1716,"Bump Fighter Aftershave Skin Conditioner, 4 Oz",0/0,5.0,"My husband swears by this product. Great for African American males with bump problems. He's learned that the company will no longer distribute the product. Oh well, when this runs out he'll be trying somethingelse!"
1717,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"The color is AMAZING. obviously, its not 100% Tiffany Blue(copyright infringement and all that) but its VERY close. that being said, I wasn't really crazy for the way this polish goes on, its not very forgiving to mistakes, you have to be very specific about the pressure you use, otherwise, half of the nail will have color, and the other won't. also, this color starts to get tacky VERY quickly, within about 5 seconds, normally, that would be wonderful, but you have to go over this to correct it when you mess up, but when its tacky, it doesn't really behave the way you want it to."
1718,Skybar {Seven-Up Bar},0/0,1.0,"I'm sorry...I am not reviewing the actual product, but just the misleading information, with the parenthetical {Seven-Up Bar}. This is NOT a Seven-Up Bar. Believe me, I KNOW. I used to steal money from the top of my Dad's dresser, sneak to the corner market, buy one of these and a Richie Rich comic book, and it was HEAVEN!!! Shame on Sky Bar for this misleading advertising."
1719,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure,1/1,4.0,"Can't explain why this was helpful in soothing my daughters scalp, but for some reason when I began to apply to other areas of her body, she broke out into an itchy rash tht was quite uncomfortable. It was all over her bad, shoulder's belly and some on her face. She's always had sensitive scalp so we can only use hypoallergenic products, but the dermatologist recommended jojoba oil as an alternative to the prescription Dermasmoothe. I will use, but will no longer use on my four year old. Back to Dove Sensitive body wash and lotion."
1720,Teatime by Haba,0/0,5.0,Who knew there were little pretend wooden tea bags for toddlers? My 2 yr. old grandaughter loves to place the tea bags in the Melissa and Doug tea cups set. It's great pretend play!
1721,"Chicken Soup for the Kitten Lover's Soul Dry Food, Chicken Formula, 15 Pound Bag",0/0,3.0,"When I started buying this for my kittens it was $23/bag. When I returned a couple of months ago to purchase again and saw the HUGE price spike I took my biz elsewhere. The food itself, at least from the west coast plant which is where mine came from, is excellent quality and I fed this to my kittens and fed the dog food to my dogs. However I won't be buying it anymore since the price hike and I actually ended up switching to a local brand where I know exactly what is going into my ""kids'"" food and I'm getting the same amount for $1.50 more. Better deal all the way around.I suggest looking elsewhere for a different food. Chicken Soup is becoming more and more scarce."
1722,K&H Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed,0/0,3.0,Bought this for my no hair cats. worked okay but it does not get as hot as some other cat warmers that I have.
1723,"Simple Solution Stain & Odor Remover, 32 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I have a male and female chihuahua. Though they both are fixed, the male feels he must mark everything in the spring and fall.I was at my wits end when I finally saw this product.I don't know why there are reviews that say it has a strong odor. I am very sensitve to this and did not find any odor at all.Just spray, dab and let dry. I used it on old and new spots. Works perfect the first time on the new spots and they do not reapeare. On old spots that have been gone over with a rug cleaner containing hot water, I did find that I need to do it again since they reapeared after a couple of weeks. The 2nd try worked perfect.I also used it on some blueberry pie filling my son dropped on the rug, which had dried. For this I had to do twice also, but it did work.As the bottle recommends, you really must saturate the area or it will not work well. After going through 2 bottles, I found that tilting the bottle and spraying the rug from an angle, as opposed to straight down, you will use much less, yet it will work just as well.I highly recommend this product."
1724,"Urine Off Odor and Stain Remover for Cats, 1 Gallon",0/0,3.0,"This would be a 5 star review if it hadn't been for a couple little quirky things that I will mention first:Cons:1) shape of the jug and handle creates a mess when trying to pour product into a smaller spray bottle - I use two of theseRubbermaid Commercial FG9C0301 HDPE 3.3 cc Spray Trigger. I have experienced a little more waste than I would like. This was solved by a funnel.2) This product seems to be much stickier than any of the other enzyme products I have used such asMisterMaxAnti Icky Poo - 1 GallonandNature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover, 32-Ounceamong others. When using this product on vomit or urine / feces on a laminate floor, it tends to leave a sticky residue where the others have not. This product seems a little thicker in viscosity.Pros:1) I like the smell, it's almost fruity. The smell does not bother our cats at all.2) We use multipleBooda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box, Titaniumboxes for our 6 kitties and this stuff does a remarkable job of cleaning any urine spray off of the sides/edges of the dome. Some of our older cats aren't quite as accurate with the litter box because of hip issues. Urine off cleans old urine smell and stains off of litter box surfaces with one swipe.This is strong stuff. It is working for cat smells (urine, vomit, feces). It isn't the cheapest nor the most expensive.I'll definitely keep using this going forward despite my 3-star review. It seems to do the best job compared to the stuff I've bought off of Amazon and from the Big Box stores."
1725,Traditional Medicinals Teas Mother's Milk Tea,1/1,5.0,"I had my twin babies at 29 weeks via c-section. I had the odds stacked against me for milk production, so I researched anything and everything I could do to improve my production. My lactation consultant suggested Mother's Milk Tea. Boy, am I soooo glad she did!! Although, I seemed to do ok producing enough on my own (about 2.5 oz per pumping session) I drank 2 cups of the tea and the next pumping I produced 6 oz!! Yep, SIX OUNCES!! I was ecstatic and plan to drink 5-6 cups a day now. It has made me feel great that I can now provide the much needed nutrients that my preterm babies need to grow and gain without worry!!"
1726,Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster,0/0,4.0,I bought this for an one year old's birthday. It worked out great for her. We normally left it on the floor with the tray locked in place but not tight so she could get in and out as she wanted. It was great for her to eat all her meals in and we could easily move it from one location to another. The washable back was a teddy bear not the giraffe like in the photo but it looked great and cleaned up easily. The chair also looks just fine without the washable back in it. I am very happy with this purchase and it was three years ago.
1727,Ultimate Nail Studio Kit,2/2,2.0,hi i got this and i think that it is ok and the nail polishes take FOREVER to dry i got this a couple of years ago not today. the dryer is nice.
1728,Invacare Supply Group Reusable Bedpads,0/0,5.0,This is the second Blue Bed Pad I ordered. I bought one and was so satisfied that I had to buy the second. They are washable and reusable. My wife is bed ridden and these are used to turn her to help prevent bed sores. They are large enough to get a handhold and move her about and turn her. They protect the bed linens and reduce the washing of those items.
1729,Tweezerman 3-in-1 Pedicure Tool,0/1,4.0,"I must say, this product does the job.You can take off a lot, be careful.The add-on's are OK, but I don't use them.~I use a pumice stone and the razor.~"
1730,Burberry Brit ~ Women 3.3 oz / 100 ml Eau de Parfum Spray,4/4,1.0,"I have used this perfume before and that was the reason I ordered it. This one is a complete fake, it does not even last for 60 minutes. Will not buy perfumes from Amazon."
1731,L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System,2/2,4.0,Due to some health issues I cannot get out to the stores as I used to. I chose this product because I could set it up with regular shipments and the color looked close to what I wanted. My natural color is now almost 100% gray. It is also very thick and course. I was sure I would need 2 boxes. Well I was wrong. One box was more than enough to give me beautiful blonde hair. I could only give it 4 stars though because I had to add extra conditioner to tame down the fuzzies. I contemplated bringing it up to a 5 because the man in my life wouldn't stop kissing me...but that may have had more to do with the catnip I just added to his new toy also purchased from Amazon.
1732,Drueke 907.00 Roll Up Chess Board with 3 3/4-Inch Chessmen,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this chess set for my son and I. My aim was to get a functional chess set to play games at home, where the board and pieces were large and easy to see and felt stable. I was not looking for a beautiful chess set to leave out on display. I am please very pleased with my purchase.The roll up board is the same material as a mouse pad. It is heavy and stable. It does not slide on the table and pieces feel more secure than on wooden or cardboard surfaces.The pieces are much larger and heavier than out old set. They have a nice substantial feel. Though they are not as attractive as carved wooden or stone pieces but they are easy to recognize and seem durable.The board and pieces are well matched for size with the board not seeming crowded making it a little easier to see moves on board.The case is quite functional. It is made with the same material as my kids backpacks for school. It appears sturdy and well made but certainly not fancy. It has zippered two compartments which hold the black and the white pieces. The board and pieces fit with some room to spare for a small chess clock, a couple of paperbacks and a couple of bottles of water.Over all I am please with the purchase and would recommend it to a friend."
1733,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,5.0,have 5 small poms & w/a large pillowtop matteries very hard for them to get to the bed. they love this as I do nice & strong & the non slip applicators is great since they love to run up & down when someone is @the door. cost is great so many are over priced for no quality.storing is great to since it folds down & I can store it on it's side.

1735,Medline Aluminum Forearm Crutches,2/2,5.0,"I needed to have new crutches. I was unsure because the cost was less than half price of all the others. I took a chance. They are excellent value, excellent and immediately ready to use. I wish the upper handles, the one that goes around the top of the arm, were able to be smooshed together to be tighter...but that is my ONLY complaint! GOOD CHOICE1"
1736,ABO Gear Dog Digs Pet Crate,0/0,5.0,"My service dog Sam and I really like his new crate. It's light, easy to open, close, pack, and carry. We do talks for Kingdom Dog Ministries and find it ideal for per-presentation comfort and convenience. Thanks for a high quality product, Fred Simmons , Simmwood Gun Dogs"
1737,"Futuro Lower Back Sacro Brace, Small (30-35 In), 1 Brace",1/1,5.0,"I suffer from chronic lower back pain. Lumbar spine has three herniated discs. Thought I would give this a try to see if would help ease my back pain when gardening. While it is not a cure, it has velcro straps that allow me to tighten it as much as needed, and the hard foam insert seems to relieve some of the pain in my back as it puts pressure on my spine as the belt provides additional support. I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this product."
1738,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,My cats love to chase this ball and the cardboard inner lasts forever I just love this toy so much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great toy with a double purpose
1739,"Aurora World 12"" Scruff The Dog",1/1,3.0,"My husband ordered Scruff for our 16-month old because he was constantly asking to hold our four-year-old's stuffed dog lovey. Scruff arrived and the little one was THRILLED! He took to him immediately and they are now the best of friends. The fabric is wonderfully soft and cuddly. Unfortunately, after just one day with him at daycare, Scruff came home with a huge hole in the seam on the back. Luckily, our son hadn't noticed, and Scruff still had all of his stuffing and beads. I was able to ""operate"" and sew him back up to be used. However, I'm very disappointed that after just one day of use (and not rough use), Scruff needed repairs. My four-year-old's dog was mine when I was young and has never needed fixing. As long as you can sew any busted seams, it's a worthwhile purchase. However, if you're at all uncomfortable with a needle and thread, I would skip this stuffed friend to find another, more durable, choice."
1740,Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Left Brace with Dorsal Stay,0/0,3.0,"The description didn't say how long it is but I thought in the picture it looked longer, but it's not; very short."
1741,L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl,0/0,1.0,"I have a couple of different nursing covers [Bebe Au Lait, MyBrestFriend, & Udder Cover] but I decided to try this one because it covers the back too. I thought this cover would provide great 360* coverage, but what it really provides is only front & back coverage with insufficient side coverage. Especially if you have a squirmy baby! The front & back are a good length but the sides are drastically shorter, making the entire cover full of gaps. It is also hard to see down inside of the cover without the rigid neckline that comes standard in a Bebe Au Lait. The fabric is about twice as thick as my other covers, so I think it'd be unbearable during summer. But I do tend to run warm these days! ;)Lastly the little pouch is a nice idea, but who has the time to fold a cover up once baby's done eating? Usually I am trying to get baby right side up to burp while putting myself back in order.And in response to this product touting itself as a versatile 4-in-1, all the things this product claims you could do with any other cover, so don't let that be a buying point for you."
1742,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,0/1,5.0,Makes being a cat owner more enjoyable than owning a dog because I don't have to deal with kitty going potty everyday and can deal with the mess and odor on my schedule. A necessary item for any cat owner and I think kitty would agree too. Purchase this with the forever litter tray.
1743,Indestructo Pill Box - 6 Per Package( Assorted Colors),0/0,5.0,"I have now ordered another package of these pill boxes to share with others! I had also previously ordered ""Mother's Little Helper"" & ""Give Us This Day Our Daily Meds"" chrome pill boxes with a clasp but they kept coming open in my purse. I now keep them on a shelf with a certain hour Rx in them."
1744,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my niece and she loves it! She is learning how to let go of items and walk on her own, so this is great for her because she has to let go of the handle to play with the items on the front of the toy. The item is colorful and teaches all kinds of stuff from numbers to letters. My niece would push it around like a shopping cart."
1745,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,0/0,3.0,"I have a large dog. After 2 doses, she is still scratching a great deal. We do spend a lot of time in the woods. Maybe after the 3rd dose, it will subside."
1746,Ole Henriksen Invigorating Night Gel,0/0,3.0,I'm not sure if it made any difference. All I can say is that I had break outs that I never had before. I will stop using it for now.
1747,"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack",0/0,5.0,The product is very good when you take it according to the instructions that come with it. I have started to see results and am very happy about it.
1748,"Pair of Swede-O Ankle Lok Lace-Up Ankle Brace, with set of side stabilizer inserts, Black",0/0,4.0,"I have used this ankle brance before and this is a lightweight but very supportive brace. It's allows the ankle to move more than the ASO ankle braces and a lot less bulky so it wont stretch out your shoe. The drawback is that the plastic inserts rub against my ankle bone and starts to be painful but luckily you can remove them and you still have really solid support.Sizing is a bit of an issue I am a standard size 12 feet but when I ordered the large size I have to lace it as tight as it goes that didn't happen last time I got these so perhaps I just got an wierd sized pair. Lastly, I got a pair for 39.99 and at that price it was a steal."
1749,"Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula Dog Food, 5-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"I have a miniature schnauzer who experiences skin irritations each summer. This past year, we switched from Natural Balance to save money and saw a huge change in our dog's skin and coat. Our dog was bald on each side of his back from dry skin, itching and irritation. Along with other remedies to help, we switched back to Natural Balance food and within a week our dog was again growing fur back in the irritated spots. We used other things topically to help, but we really do think that the food quality of this product helped. We recommend this highly."
1750,Prestige 5.5 inch Nurses Utility Scissors,0/0,4.0,"There isn't a whole lot to say about scissors. I purchased them to have in my emergency med kit. The edges are a little bit sharp, so I will probably file them down a little to ensure no snagging. Other than that, they are quite sharp and cut well without binding."
1751,Lafeber's Classic Nutri-Berries for Cockatiels (4 Lb. Tub),0/0,5.0,My birds have been eating these for a many years and I was so glad to get it delivered right to my door!
1752,Enzymatic Therapy Acidophilus Pearls,0/0,5.0,A friend pointed me to these saying they had done wonders for her lactose-intolerant husband. I've been taking them once a day for a few weeks and wow.. I'm still lactose intolerant but not nearly with the severity of before. These pills really have have helped my overall digestive system.
1753,Forever Elizabeth Perfume by Elizabeth Taylor for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,3.0,"I ordered this eau de parfum because I'd previously ordered ""Lavender Eyes"" by Elizabeth Taylor, and I love that fragrance. ""Forever Elizabeth"" is a lovely scent, but, within a few minutes after I put it on, the fragrance is gone. Too bad that it doesn't last - that's why I gave it only 3 stars."
1754,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,1/1,5.0,Very fast service and my choice was just as ordered. I would order from this company any time I needed a product.
1755,"Duro-Med Acrylic Cane, Clear",0/0,5.0,"This cane is a little heavier than I expected in contrast with my hospital wooden cane, but other than that a very steady cane. Super fast delivery... Thank you"
1756,Just Once - Kids' One Multistars,0/0,2.0,"My kids would not eat them. It was a battle over them taking them with tears and all, but then I realized they do taste horrible. What a waste of money... in the trash they go. On a side note, I bought the smarty pants gummies afterwards and they like the taste of those. Should have started there."
1757,Papo Set of 4 Big Cats - Lion Family and White Tiger,0/0,4.0,"The price is great since it includes 4 very well sculpted figures. After finding out how much they costed each alone, I was really glad to find this package. Definitively worth buying."
1758,"Farmer's Market Foods Organic Canned Pumpkin, 15-Ounce Cans",1/1,3.0,"I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the ""Amazon Frustration-Free"" packaging). The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the ""Farmer's Market"" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order."
1759,Lansinoh Breast Milk Storage Bags 50&#45;pk&#46;,0/0,5.0,"I am a busy working mom, pumping 3 times a day (at least). These bags work great. I carefully refined my pumping process for minimum time and effort and for maximum return, and these bags are an important part of the system. I use a double electric breast pump, and I screw a rigid plastic bottle on to one of the breast shield assemblies, while I hook one of these bags to the other breast shield assembly with good quality masking tape. When I'm done, I pour from the plastic bottle into the bag, label it, and stick it in my cooler. I have used hundreds of these bags for collection, storage, transport, and freezing of breast milk. Only one has leaked over the course of 9 months - that's a darn good track record, in my opinion. I can't say enough good things about these bags."
1760,Adam And Eve Adams Pleasureskin Dildo 7.75 Inch Natural,0/0,5.0,"I was finally decided to get a dildo for myself, and I am so pleased with this product! It definitely could be considered too big for a beginner, but after some gentle play is very comfortable. Do not buy this unless you want something big to fill all the crevices. for anyone with a stronger pelvic floor and some more experience with toys, this was so good that thinking about it is exciting!"
1761,"Ethical Puppy Pacifier 4-Inch Latex Dog Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,My dogs favorite toy. This is his second one and the first one has lasted him for years. He loves it! Thanks
1762,Williams Williams Mug Shaving Soap,0/1,1.0,"Been wet shaving about a year now and like it. I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS. Again, I find that you get what you pay for in life and this was lousy but cheap. Work hard to lather and it will dry up before you can pick up your razor and go to it. Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate. It sizzles like alka-selzer in a glass of water! I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here. I really didn't mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that, so I can't say that it smells bad. That's my advice."
1763,Koolatron Electronic Pet Flea Zapping Comb,2/2,3.0,I found the zapper would not work on my american bulldog at all because he has short short course hairs; with my two who are calico mix it would stun the fleas but not kill them. not really impressed with the product and would not recommend it to anyone.
1764,Saft LS14250 - 1/2 AA 3.6 Volt Primary Li-SOCl2 Lithium Battery Cell (Same as LS14250C),0/0,5.0,item came fast and did what it was supposed to. great! yes yes yes yes yes yes! yes yes yes
1765,Hohner Kids / Pair of Mexican Wood Maracas,0/0,5.0,"These are almost full sized maracas, but my 9 month son is able to hold them. I wouldn't recommmend them for too much younger though. They did seem to come with some kind of shiny finish on them, but we wiped them down with a wet paper towel and that seemed to remove some of the glossiness which we didn't want him to eat.He has banged them on our hardwood floor quite vigorously and a lot and these show no sign of breaking or cracking. They are currently one of his favorite toys."
1766,Escape by Calvin Klein for Women,0/1,1.0,My bottle has a cheaper top/cap system and the contents does not have the lovely smell of my previously purchased bottle (from a department store). The real shame is that I was to busy to actually open the package until after my 30 days had lapsed. My fault; please learn from my mistake! Posted by his wife :-)
1767,"Wild Chokecherry Jelly, 11oz",0/0,4.0,"I am a chef who is American and lives in England...I was asked to create a gourmet burger that represented the Mid West..particularly a North Dakota burger...I made a burger topped with homemade style German Russian potato salad, topped with Schnitzel, topped with your Wild CC Jam..It was a perfect accompaniment..The only thing I had a problem with is that you do not send internationally I did have to have it sent to my mothers in R.I. and it did make it more expensive but the jam itself was wonderful...Thank you!AnnieAnnies Burger Shack[...]Heres a pic![...]"
1768,Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Dome Caps,0/0,5.0,These caps were hard to find at this price!They have been a lifesaver! I have referred a friend to also buy them!Good quality and came quickly!Very happy with this purchase!!
1769,Merry Pet Products-Cat Washroom And Night Stand,0/0,1.0,"One star is being quite generous... The idea behind this is great -- but the shape is just wrong for every litter box I could find (aside from the really small, shallow ones for kittens) -- it just isn't deep enough. I ended up buying a small dishpan to use, and it just barely fits -- my goal was to have the cat get out of the litterbox inside, so that litter wouldn't end up all over the floor. This is next to impossible. And I fortunately listened to other reviews suggesting that the furniture piece be lined with contact paper before using, because if you have a cat over 5 pounds, there just isn't enough room for them, and they are constantly peeing over the edge of the litter box. So great idea, but poor design. Assembly was okay -- we found that some of the screws didn't go in straight, and ended up poking through the cheap wood side pieces. I would NOT recommend this item for a cat, and there is NO ventilation, and the ammonia smell burns my eyes (even after we clean up the ""misses"" -- can only imagine what our poor cats thought. Back to the old style of boxes for us."
1770,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"Love having the diapers delivered to my door vs. having to lug them from the store to my car and from my car inside my house. Plus, it is cheaper."
1771,"H.B.H. Enterprises AHH30026 Carbon Pad for Aquarium Filter, 10 by 18-Inch",0/0,5.0,Received the filter in a timely manner for my new GE Microwave. I have no external vent so rely on the carbon filters. Cut one for the top to double that filter then cut one for the grease filter underneath. The item is thick so I tore it in half and it is held in easily above the grease filter. Yes it released some carbon that is imbedded in the mesh but now I will get at least a total of four filters for this low price. Do it yourself and save.
1772,Scott's Cakes Maple Walnut Fudge Balls in a Decorative Bag,0/0,1.0,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
1773,Garden of Life Primal Defense Ultra Ultimate Probiotics Formula,1/2,5.0,"I ordered this Friday, 10/12/12, it was expected to be delivered 10/18/12. It arrived Monday, 10/15/12. Much sooner than I expected. Instead of the 180 count, I received a 216 count bottle! I can't attest to its effectiveness, but given the positive ratings I'm sure it will work fine."
1774,"Ecover Limescale Remover, 16-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This stuff is perfect for limescale build up in the shower head, toilet bowl and shower glass. Not to mention anywhere else lime scale annoys you, this stuff just melts it away. I work in a renovation and maintenance company, and when we have to redo bathrooms, this product gets sprayed on first to loosen and remove the limescale that has accumulated.Highly recommeneded"
1775,"Polo by Ralph Lauren for Men, Eau De Toilette Natural Pour",3/3,1.0,"I have been wearing Polo cologne for over 25 years. I have always purchased from a major department store or a major retailer. When I ran out I recently decided to use an Amazon gift card and purchase my Polo on Amazon, thinking I could save some money.The product was sold through a marketplace seller. I had read reviews about customers receiving counterfeit fragrances from Amazon marketplace sellers in the past, so I weeded through the sellers to find one that appeared to be legit. In hindsight, I should have spent slightly more money and gone with the nationwide fragrance chain store that was also selling on Amazon. Then I could have been certain that what I was ordering was legit and I could have stopped into their bricks and mortar store here locally if there were issues.The product packaging for my order was all top notch and very genuine looking. The labels, wrapping, box, and even the printing on the bottle was all crisp and precise. It passed my visual test.The fragrance smells the part, so that passed my sniffer test. I thought all was good.After a few weeks of daily use, here is what I can say"
1776,"The Ultimate Life - The Ultimate Meal, 1200 g powder",1/1,4.0,"The taste of this is not the best, but now after a few months of trying a few recipes and going heavy on things like vanilla and fruits, I now like taking this without having to worry about taste. A perfect choice for a breakfast meal."
1777,"Demeter Fragrance Library - Spirits, Champagne & Cocktails - Cologne Collection",1/1,5.0,Have been using this cologne for years. Not much on wearing perfume but have always enjoyed this light and unusual fragrance. Actually refreshing especially in the hot summer. Wish the scent lasted longer on my skin.
1778,Throughly Clean Face Wash - Original - 8 oz. (250 ml) - Liquid,0/0,5.0,"We have used this soap not just as face wash, but body wash and hand soap as well for years. Nothing else even comes close and we would never use anything else. (For hand soap, we dilute it with a 1/2 solution of acid water from our Orion Jupiter water filter that is anti-septic--so gentle, and such a natural way to disinfect without chemicals of any kind.) Every time I have to use some other soap or we are without it, I realize how much I rely on this stuff and how great it is. It cleans so gently and thoroughly without any residues of any kind. Highly concentrated, you only need a very little amount, so it goes a long time if you use it appropriately. We dilute it for this reason especially with the kids as they have the tendency to forget having to use other soaps at school and other places where you need a whole lot to get clean. They often complain about how other soaps 'don't wash off' no matter how long you rinse for, and it winds up drying out their hands as a result and in winter, it cracks them and hurts! I have highly sensitive skin so I'm very careful about everything and anything I use on my skin, and this is so gentle yet powerful, natural and leaves no residue at all! It is simply the best. Also it doesn't smell which is really nice-- just a very light, almost non-existent lemony type smell--just clean. Great for the chemically sensitive or peeps who just hate strong smells. Soaps usually stink too! This doesn't. So nice. This brand is better than anything else--and it has to be the face wash--or else you just get what is castile soap basically without the benefits of the tea tree. My family generally has very clear skin-- but for the occasional blemish, we'll put a drop on the blemish and let it dry overnight, and usually by morning it will be either gone or greatly diminished especially after a hot water compress first. With two teenagers, this helps them tremendously keep clear and free of acne. I would highly recommend this product, even more for people who have sensitive skin, chemical sensitivities, or skin issues in general. We love this stuff. Also, buying it in the 32 fl oz is a huge savings and a great deal. Can't go wrong with this one."
1779,Probar - 12 Pack,1/1,1.0,"I am sorry, but I have to give a bad review. I found little hard things in some to the bars, like wallnut shells or little rocks? But I can't eat them, this buy was a loss, money down the drian.."
1780,Personna Shaper Blades,0/0,5.0,"Really sharp, and if you're using them for personal use like shaving they'll last 5+ shaves even if you have thick facial hair."
1781,Ravensburger Make 'N' Break - Family Game,1/1,4.0,"This is a pretty fun game for kids. On a player's turn a card is drawn with an image of a structure that the player has to build with the blocks. Some require the same colored blocks in the exact places, and other cards only require the structure, so colored blocks can be used any way desired. There is a timer and a player can build as many structures as they're able until the timer goes off. There are also two decks of cards, an easier group and a harder group. Even with me using the harder cards and my 8 y.o. using the easier ones, I really had to purposefully slow myself down in order to make the game seem close and not beat her with a landslide.Our daughter loves games and we try to find games that we can play with her without us having to ""dumb ourselves down"" (for lack of a better description) and pretend it's harder than it is in order to play it with her. There are a lot of games out there that adults can play with kids in which they can fully use their own skills and knowledge which makes it more enjoyable (forbidden island is a great example and is our current favorite kids game). To us it feels patronizing and untruthful to have to ""pretend"" that a game is harder or more interesting than it really is in order to play it with our daughter. We'd rather play games that really are engaging for all ages rather than pretending that they are.If you have kids that will play together then this game would be great for them. For adults playing with kids, you'll have to pretend it's harder than it is or else you'll easily beat the kids which isn't very fun or fair for them."
1782,Donkey Pinata 8&#34; (Treat Filled) Bird Toy,0/0,5.0,"Our African Grey parrot, Janey, who is a Congo,loves to rip these to shreds. But Mac, our Timneh, who is also an African Grey, is not one bit interested in them. He would rather have the box it comes in to destroy. You just never know about African Greys!"
1783,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,We lost the pet mat (bed) we had and looked for another one similar to the one we had lost. This one is an excellent replacement.
1784,Hamadi Shea Leave In,0/0,2.0,I have the shea spray and saw rave reviews on this leave in so thought I would try it..not too impressed. First of all it was VERY expensive and the ingredients weren't very different from other leave ins I have tried that weren't as expensive. I used it once...about a nickel size amount and knew I would never use it again so I contaced the seller to return it and I was going to have to return it as a used item and have a percentage taken off and pay for return shipping. This little bottle was almost $40...give me a break!!! If I bought directly through Amazon I could have returned it for a full refund...just like if I would have bought it from the salon. From now on I will only deal directly with Amazon. I am keeping it and putting it the graveyard hair product box. Huge disappointment!
1785,Bebe Au Lait Nursing Cover,0/0,5.0,I love this cover. It is the perfect weight and thickness. I would recommend this to any of my friends.
1786,Body Wash,0/0,5.0,"This is the most refreshing way to start a day! This gel is so nice and comforting on the skin, I wouldnt' use any other. I literally awaken my senses the moment the cap comes off the top and I begin to lather the gel on my skin. Such bliss!"
1787,Cholula Original Mexican Hot Sauce with Wooden Stopper Top - 12 oz,0/0,4.0,"""Hey, just because this is a highly recognized, readily available brand doesn't mean it doesn't deliver the goods"" according to Scott Roberts. Who is Scott Roberts? I didn't have a clue until a recent NPR show. It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement.On my own, I've been taste testing hot sauces, unaware of Roberts or an entire movement of ""chili-heads"". I've purchased about 40 hot sauces and began taste testing them - day after day - week after week - writing up notes. (Everyone needs a hobby)What I found is Cholula is one of the best and it is near the top. BTW"
1788,Candy Blocks 2 Lbs.,0/0,4.0,This product came on time. It was a large quantity of candy. The colors were not as bright as the picture but there was no denying it was lego candy. I made 35 little bags out of the 2lb package. I got the bags from a craft store and tied them with lego colored ribbon. I don't think you would want a child eating more than the 2 oz in one sitting. It is hard candy that is clearly all sugar. You could build with the candy which was cool. I did have a peanut allergy at the party and the mom said she checked it on line and he was able to eat it. Which he did with no problems.
1789,The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup,0/0,1.0,"I feel like I've tried 10 different types of sippy cups so far, and these ones are the worst! While I appreciate that the sippy cup doesn't spill, it is also impossible to drink from! After seeing my son get frustrated when he tried to drink, my husband and I both tried it. No matter how hard I sucked on it, i could not get out more than a dribble. The only way to get them to work was to cut a hole in it, which then made it not spill proof. Do not buy."
1790,Kidkusion Hearth Kushion,0/0,3.0,It worked very well for the application in which it was use. I installed it on a Conductor's Podium. Our Music Teacher keeps walking into it.
1791,Smackaroos Diet Treats Plain Low Carb Crackers,1/1,2.0,"I was so dying for a low carb cracker so I could enjoy some Atkin's approved tuna fish or egg salad on it, that I ordered four boxes of these crackers in different flavors. I anxiously waited a week for their arrival and immediately dug into one....Let me tell you what these taste exactly like. When you were young, were you ever feeling adventurous and wondered what your pet Fido's dog biscuits tasted like? I did and used to chew half-heartedly on one now and then. Remember that hard, mealy taste?Smackaroos crackers taste exactly like dog biscuits. Flatter, thinner dog biscuits.I mean, I'm eating mine because I laid out $25 for four tiny boxes (and yes, the boxes are tiny) and don't have money to waste. But I can't decide if they're better than nothing.So if you want to sample Smackaroos, go to a PetSmart or your neighbor's house and borrow a dog biscuit.Same darn flavor."
1792,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,4.0,"My dog is a puller and likes to slip out of her harness. The easy walk works pretty good to stop both. My dog seems to like this harness a lot. The thing is I don't use it. I use the Gentle Leader Head Collar which is the greatest dog collar/harness ever made. The easy walk helps the pulling, but the Gentle Leader Head collar eliminates it. It's a catch 22. Go with the easy walk and still have a bit of pulling, but your dog won't mind wearing it. Now go with the head collar, you won't have pulling but your dog won't be as comfortable (my dog got use to it and now wears it with no problems)."
1793,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,When I ordered this polish I was thinking more of a ultra bright green glow stick color. It was far from that. I find China Glaze does dry rather quickly but to achieve the color I wanted I needed about 5 coats. Which is a little ridiculous because who has time to sit and wait for FIVE coats of nail polish to dry?! This color is a disappointment for me but it will not stop me from purchasing or recommending other China Glaze colors to others.
1794,Pureology ShineMax Shining Smoother (select option/size),1/1,1.0,"The Shine Max product that I was looking for was actually a ""smoother"" not the spray. (This product has been discontinued by Pureology.) SO... when I saw the picture of the product, I was thrilled. Unfortunately I did not read carefully! The product that was being sold was a spray- but that is not what is pictured!I really feel that it was a misrepresentation of the product."
1795,Tuli's Classic Gel Heel Cups,0/0,2.0,This product didn't help my plantar fasciitis at all. There is a thicker one that helped slightly but still not very well.
1796,"7"" Foam Ball - Assorted Colors; no. SLT247",0/0,5.0,I would definitely reccommend this product to anyone with young children. It was purchsed to be used for parachute games for my 3 year old Grand daughter. The ball is safe to use indoors since it is light weight and soft and will not harm any household items.
1797,Guardian Martingale Pet Collar - Black,0/0,5.0,We had tried many collars on our two small dogs. They just didn't do the job. My dogs are rescued dogs and I have tried to train them not to pull on the leash. These collars have worked the best for us and they do a lot less pulling with them.
1798,J.L. Childress Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag,0/0,5.0,Great product- easy to carry as a backpack. We had two flights (both with connections) and it was great. I would recommend putting something on it to easily identify it as yours though...
1799,Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"I found this as a sample from one of my hotel stays and found it to be gentle, not too stinky, and cleans well. I find that it is gentle enough that I can use it every day. It makes me mad when I go to buy a product that I like, I find that it has been discontinued. I already purchased it again."
1800,Carex Universal Bath Bench with Back,0/0,5.0,"This is a great shower chair for the larger person. It is very stable. I feel very comfortable sitting on it. It comes with the back, but you do not have to use it. I put it together myself, no tools, in 5 mins. The height is adjustable by unscrewing the legs."
1801,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,We lost the pet mat (bed) we had and looked for another one similar to the one we had lost. This one is an excellent replacement.
1802,Brut Cologne by Faberge for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"This was so perfect. A friend of mine who lives in the Czech Republic received a bottle as a gift years ago and has been nursing it ever since, afraid to run out and have none left. So I checked on Amazon and low and behold, there is was. I ordered 5 bottles so he will be set for life! It was great to see how excited he was. It is still the best fragrance that Brut has had for years. I am so glad they did not try to change anything. Even the bottle with the medallion remains the same."
1803,Melissa & Doug 20 Animal Magnets in a Box,0/0,5.0,We have had these animals in the kitchen on the dishwasher off and on this past year. Great for reinforcing animal names and sounds. I think the quality is really great and it keeps him busy while I am cooking or cleaning up.
1804,"Source Naturals Relora, 250mg",0/0,5.0,"I alternate this with my Passion Flower that I purchased on here. I have only been on a week, but it also takes a edge off my anxiety. I take this during the day. Only been on it a week, but I will let you know how it works as far as a stress eating reducer. It interacts with Cortisol, and helps curb stress eating also. Which I need."
1805,Bicycle Poker Size Standard Index Playing Cards (Blue or Red),0/0,3.0,These cards are sufficiently stiff when new. They do wear out at about an average rate when compared with other cards. They're definitely better quality than the giveaway swag-type cards you'll find at corporate events.
1806,Booda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop,0/0,1.0,"I liked the holder for the scoop however the scoop was flimsey & bent & cracked while scooping.Booda Scoop'N Hide Litter Scoop, Titanium"
1807,Nupro Joint Support 5 pound,0/0,1.0,"Seems there are counterfeit tubs of nuPro being sold. Go to the website and buy direct.This product did not look like nupro, did not smell like nupro and didnt work like nupro. Tossed it."
1808,"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 3 Pack",0/0,5.0,"I use these on Evenflow bottles for freezing breastmilk. They are great, much better than the other brands I have tried. I would definitely recommend these!"
1809,OXO Good Grips Soap Dispensing Palm Brush,0/0,4.0,"Great product. It makes washing dishes so much easier. It is especially helpful with greasy items - pots and pans, in particular. I also use it (without the soap) to wipe off plates before putting them in the dishwasher.The only downside about this product is that a lot of soap comes out. I wish that there was more control over that. But, it's really it isn't that big of a deal."

1811,Scott's Cakes Gourmet Caramel Popcorn in a Decorative Bag,0/0,2.0,"So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."

As I mentioned I have been using Fast since April and my hair has not grown any faster, if you are looking to grow your hair, this is NOT your answer! Try using vitamins like biotin, or some other form of hair vitamin supplements, or don't cut your hair!"

1829,Pampers Swaddlers,1/1,5.0,"We've tried Huggies, Luvs, generic big-brand stores etc. Pampers beats them all. Very few if ever have any blowouts, or leaks with these diapers. Huggies came in as the worst, and Luvs are not too bad but we still found these Pampers to be the best.These hug him around the legs really well, and the absorbancy is huge. The diaper bloats out like a balloon sometimes overnight but keeps the sheets and him dry.Our older son is just about out of Diapers and also used Pampers all throughout his first 2 years. Never any issues. And if there are no issues, then isn't that what it's all about?"

1831,Gy-Na-Tren Oral/Vaginal Kit 14 Day Supply New & Improved - 1 - Kit,0/0,5.0,"This product was a last resort for me prior to seeing a doctor, who most likely would have prescribed antibiotics. I had been dealing with bacterial vaginosis for several weeks and had tried hydrogen peroxide douches (which evidently has worked for many women) as well as another product, femdophilus. Nothing had worked for me yet. And at first, I did not think this product was working either. It is supposed to be taken regularly for 14 days, and the two weeks was almost up before my symptoms ceased. But the symptoms did go away by the time the 14 days was finished. That was about two months ago, and the infection has not returned.I was hesitant about the effectiveness of the product simply because I ordered it. I've read on the web that the heat a product like this might be exposed to during shipping might damage its effectiveness (and I placed this order in August!). But the product worked nevertheless."

1834,Individuel Eau de Toilette for Men by Mont Blanc,1/1,5.0,"Wow..!! That is my first impression of Mount Blanc's Individuel. I later purchased Mount Blanc's Cool Presence and Star Walker, but less impressed with those. I first noticed the bottle and clean sleek design with the Mount Blanc logo on top of the cap. Easy on the eyes and a classy design. The fragrance comes out clean, fresh, and smooth - I detect hints of fruit and (call me crazy - maybe cinnamon).As noted in other reviews, I generally consider the following areas"
1835,Boiron Oscillococcinum,0/0,5.0,"Oscillococcinum is the reason I don't get sick. Anytime I feel under the weather or before taking a plane (where getting sick is common), I take a dose right away (I always have some in my purse) and it goes away quite quickly. If I don't take it right away, I need to take a dose every couple of hours and it works too. I LOVE this 100% natural product from France."

I'm an idiot.Anyway.I know this is raw, and I'm not calling the Sunfood folks liars, I'm sure it is, and I've bought and liked a number of their other branded products (from their website), but"

I can get get Lipton Onion Soup, Beefy Onion and Savory Herb, but the Onion/Mushroom has disappeared from the shelves. Ask the managers - well they're not much help and claim they have no idea either. Yet it's always been a favorite in my family for not only soup but also as a seasoning in meatloaf, stews, etc. not to mention the teriffic gravy it makes. Another favorite of ours - onion/mushroom soup mix stirred into sour cream for a dip. Absolutely delicious! I had ordered these from Amazon before and the shipment of 12 boxes goes a long way. Just happy they're still available and at a reasonable price, which is always a plus. This time I put it on ""Subscribe & Save"" and even it it's only a small saving, I'm hoping that it will still be availabe in the future.

The formula is GREAT....very creamy and easy to apply. This is THE perfect black with just a little bit of shine (I use a clear topcoat on all of my polishes for a super high shine).My only rant about the polish is the price....of course it is on par with the brand and the rest of the nail polishes they offer. This was my first NON glitter polish (I also own Across the Universe, Bad Romance and Glitter in the Air)....It's my favorite go to for a plain black nail."

They also love building things.We were really excited to try this one out- to see if it is challenging enough for the adults but not too hard for the 7 year old.The basic premise is that you have colored blocks. You have a set time to try and build structures with the blocks from a picture card. The successfully completed structures earn points, which accumulate towards winning.We enjoy playing it, and I think the idea of making 3D structures from pictures is a really important skill to learn.Pros"

I was having a problem finding it in drugstores, as it's an older shade. However I got it easily through Amazon and at a good price, too. For a glam occasion I like to use it on my finger nails. The name conjures up France and sipping a deep red vintage. That's a good description of Bordeaux."

1865,"CLR PP 4-5 Power Plumber Drain Opener, 4.5 oz Pressurized Can",1/2,1.0,"I used 6 can of these, but it did fix my problem at the end.the only reason I used 6 can is that because i didn't cover the water overflow too well [especially in bathtubs], and the pressurized air [$$$$$] just went out through the overflow instead going down to the drain.. I bought it from Ace Hardware [11.99+tax], and it was a quite expensive first experience for me, but once you get the trick, one bottle should last you a long time. [1 (one) fast press ONLY, if you continuously to press it, your can will be empty in 4 seconds [That is how i wasted my 6 bottles], and it might be damaging your pipes if you had pipes that are connect with lose a No Hub Coupling couplings..] and it did blast all over the place for me.. tons clear up, and all the stink stuff just erupted from the pipes.. so do inspect all your pipes before you are going to use it. if not, you will have a stink house for weeks. I learn it from the hard way, hope you guys can learn from my mistake if you want to give it a try.As those bad reviews, you should get 6-7 bottles of these and learn how to use it. Because you will miss out if you give up too easily because of one can.I give 1 star for the price and let people know what they should be caution about before using this product ..- but it is well worth it if you are calling a plumber to do your work."
1866,Thermoskin Lumbar Support in Beige,1/1,4.0,"I use it when my back is causing me to not be able to stand upright. Without it I have to lean forward and use a cane to support myself. I still use the can along with it at times. I sometimes wear it at night because by accident I found it helps with some of my neurological problems. I found that it helps to relieve my Neuropathy in my legs, arms and chest. I have actually had to wrap my arms and legs in ace bandages before I got this brace. I don't know if it will work for you; but I was really glad I found it. The only things I would mention is that it does get warm sometimes. I tend to become very warm when I sleep. Also I wish it was a little longer. Otherwise I would recommend it."
1867,JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,0/0,5.0,"I love this thing! Purchased as a ""partial coverlet"" for my twin bed because of small dog with an incontinence problem. Luckily, I have not had reason to test the serious waterproof ability yet, though it does handle other simple spills well. There was no smell at all when product arrived. Colours were perfect match. For my purposes, I could do without the straps and flaps designed for tote style, but it's a nice option to have. Laundered in a normal home washer/dryer with no problems. Overall, it was much more supple afterward, though the tote panels remained sturdy as intended. Looks great in the room, and even with two dogs on it daily, does not show dirt or wear. Silky top side also feels nicely ""cool"" in Summer."

1869,Kose Sekkisei Lotion (Refreshing Toner) 200ml/6.7 fl.oz,1/1,4.0,"The toner is quite hydrating, absorbs fast and leaves no residue to the skin. Some people may complain about the alcohol content in this toner, so I wouldn't recommend it to the people have sensitive skin. But for normal/oily skin it is quite good. Since I have dry skin, I usually use another thicker toner after this one to make my skin more hydrated. Sometimes I use it with the compressed mask, which is also from Sekkisei. The smell of this toner is kinda light and refreshing, so it's pretty pleasant to pat on.As to the brightening effect of this toner, I haven't seen much change(I have fair to medium skin tone), since I've only used half bottle."

I don't tolerate much heat, I always look for flavor. This one is comparable to the Smoked Chipotle sauce by Tabasco, found at Chipotle (the burritos place), with a little more heat and a little more flavor."
1878,Hugg-a-Planet Hugg-A-Planet,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old is super curious about the world. This globe gives us a durable way to show him where one place is in relation to another, the oceans, continents, etc. ""Real"" globes are expensive and not really appropriate in the hands of a toddler. This is perfect for this age! I also bought one for his classroom. His teacher was thrilled with it. Minute details are hard to make out, but when you are 4 it is awesome."

Today I sliced my finger pretty good when pruning and my dad brought me these new band aids he has started using that stay on well when working; and wow do they hold! I needed to apply quite a lot of pressure for 15 minutes to stop the bleeding first, and when I put this on it sticks so well I was able to wrap it to apply a lot of pressure. It even stayed nice and tight after taking a shower. Like my dad, I have always had trouble keeping band aids on throughout the day, but these definitely do the trick! Plus, they look awesome with this woven white and tan pattern. I think this helps a lot staying on because it flexes around contours nicely adhering to more surface.I RECOMMEND these to anyone covering a wound. They apply can apply a lot of pressure if you want it to, stay on a lot time, and actually look great!"

1887,NaturVet GrassSaver Chewable Wafers 300/Pk,0/0,5.0,"We tried to use some of the special rocks to no avail, but these tablets seem to work for our 69 pound Labradoodle. Grass is not turning brown/no burn spots, our dog loves them and seems to be doing just fine - no changes in her behavior or stool due to the tablets."
1888,Flexrake Deluxe Carpet Scratch Post 1047,2/2,5.0,"We have two small kittens, and this is the perfect size and height for them to ""attack"" - it keeps them away from the furniture"
1889,Suction Grab Bar 16 Inches,0/0,5.0,I ordered this product after my wife damaged her knee and experienced problems getting into and out of the shower. It has been in use for about six months now and has never lost suction or had to be re-installed. It has been a terrific physical assist which provides support and confidence to my wife.
1890,Tigi Bed Head Cocky Hair Paste Thickening Paste for Fuller Looking Hair,0/0,5.0,"Seriously - a few years ago the woman that cuts my thick, straight hair recommended this stuff to me. She showed me how to use just a little pea sized amount, with a little water, to scrunch up my hair a bit and give it some body. This stuff is totally amazing and, since you use so little, it last like an entire year! Seriously.. an entire year's worth of hair gel would cost like $200, but this great product is under $20.Recommend to anyone and everyone and you should buy it here because it is hard to find."
1891,78007 1/350 USS Enterprise Carrier,0/0,5.0,"I enjoyed putting this model together, and it reminds me of when I served on the Big E as a 20 year old in 1966-67 in VAW-112 in Vietnam."
1892,Natural Calm Natural Vitality,0/0,4.0,NATURAL CALM is a great relaxing magnesium supplement. This product will balance your calcium intake and restore healthy magnesium levels. This product also helps reduce stress after a hard days work! Use as derected.
1893,H415 Eight In One Ultimate Crunchy Ferret Diet 4.4lb,1/1,1.0,"I bought one bag of this food and it was fine. The food in the second bag was lighter in color than the first. Not a big deal, but I've noticed that since starting this bag, their poops are quite mushy and not well formed."
1894,"Bed Wedge-Foam Wedge Pillow. Good for Acid Reflux, Snoring.",5/5,3.0,"This is a revised review. Changed from 4 stars to 3 stars after using it for a while.This review is for the 12"" BED WEDGE Pillow by DMI (Duro-Med Industries), distributed by Briggs Medical. I've posted photos with additional details.I purchased this pillow for my husband's regular use and my occasional use. My husband uses it for two reasons:1. To reduce congestion my husband experiences in his nose, throat, and chest during sleep.2. To be able to see the television better while lying in bed.It allows you to elivate your head so you can see the television while lying in bed (we still have to add one or two regular bed pillows for comfort), which is better than piling up 4 or 5 pillows as we've done for years. And (more importantly) my husband's sinuses don't drain into the back of his throat and make him choke & gurgle and snore while sleeping. But we have a few other comments.THIS IS AN ADDED COMMENT, ENTERED ON 11-16-12, AFTER I FIRST CREATED THIS REVIEW ON 10-20-12:At first my husband told me he was very happy with this pillow, after he used it for a few days, but now that he's had it for about 4 weeks he rarely uses it. He now says it makes him feel like he's sliding down onto his elbows and it puts pressure on his elbows and butt. Another reviewer said the same thing. I honestly really do not understand how this could be, because he has been piling up pillows to produce the same reclining position for years. The only thing I can think is that the firmness of the pillow is the problem - instead of your body sinking in and getting comfortable, you slide down it like a, well, like a slide, because it's so firm. This is why I changed the star rating today from 4 to 3, because my husband now doesn't like to use it to sleep. He only uses it once in a while to watch TV while lying down. Not worth the money I spent. I think they really need to make these pillows softer. All of the other information in my review, below, still stands as true.OKAY, BUT COULD USE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS:My husband and I both feel this pillow is a bit too firm, but we also realize if it were softer then it wouldn't do as good a job of lifting his head - his head and shoulders would instead sink down. So, we feel the firmness is needed, just not as firm as it is now. To make it more comfortable against his body he places a layer of soft pillows on top of the wedge. Suggestion to manufacturer"
1895,MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation - Choose Colors -,0/0,5.0,"I LOVE this powder, it goes great with my foundation, giving me amazing full coverage. But, when I'm in a hurry, I can apply just the powder to my skin and still get a great, quick cover up. I'll never go back to Bare Essentials!"
1896,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"Any man wanting to wear a beard or mustache should consider buying one of these. I started wearing a goatee about a year ago and decided then to buy it. It's been the perfect tool for maintaing a well groomed appearance on a day to day basis and it has performed without a glitch. The adjustable depth blade guard provides for easy control, and consistency, of the length at which the beard is cut. It's also great for keeping eyebrows trimmed if your inclined to do so. Remove the guard and one can easily use the trimmer to carefully shape the limits of facial hair or otherwise get rid of unwanted/unsightly hairs. After nearly a year of service I expect to be using this trimmer for many more."
1897,"Bamboo Quick Control Extra-Large Collar, 22-26""",0/0,3.0,"The collar is nice and good quality... as just a collar it is a good deal. However, the built in leash is a little questionable. Maybe it is just because it is new or maybe because my dog is not a 'puller', but the elastic that 'is the leash' is so tight I nearly lift my 120 pound dog off his feet to get it to extend. Basically the leash is a big rubber band built into the collar. Problem is the rubber is so strong and requires constant pressure to keep extented, it is really ONLY for EMERGENCY use. I do not see it being useful as I daily use leash. Also, the extra material does add some weight to the collar."
1898,Social Light Ambiance Antiqued Brass Lighter,1/1,1.0,This looks pretty and worked for a couple months so i ordered another.As soon as i ordered the new one the old one stopped lighting becauseof something going on at the end of the tube. I could only light it with a match.Drained it and did all that good stuff and didn't help.I sent it back to a place called 'Intergral' out of Florida.They 'repaired' it which amounted to having the same defect untouchedwith an additional defect which had Butane gas leak abundantlyand noisily out the back end. A pretty but pretty poor lighter with horrid service.
1899,Hinged Elevated Toilet Seat,4/4,5.0,"I have three American Standard builder-grade toilets in the home, all with builder-grade seats and lids, nothing fancy. For the two upstairs (more private) toilets, I purchased two ofInvacare Raised Toilet Seat. For the downstairs, more public toilet, the Hinged Elevating Toilet Seat fit the bill perfectly.Installation instructions are exceedingly sketchy (picture on the side of the box without explanation, and some assembly required), so here are my tips/tricks:1) Clean and remove completely the existing toilet seat and lid, setting aside ONLY the bolts holding them to the toilet. You won't need these again unless you uninstall the product.2) Identify the tops/bottoms of the hinged raised seat and bracket holder (my names for them). The top of the raised seat is absolutely smooth, with a small rim on the bottom side (installed towards the toilet bowl rim). The top of the bracket holder is completely smooth and the bottom of the bracket holder has a plastic recycle code on it.2) On a secure surface, such as padded carpet, place the bracket holder flat side down (curved side up). Align the raised seat with the ""slide into place"" slots on the sides of the bracket, making sure both sides match as to ""up"" and ""down"" in the final installation (completely smooth side of seat aligned with the completely smooth side of the bracket). Here's the tricky part"
1900,Chicco C6 Stroller,0/0,3.0,"I got this stroller b/c my friend raved about how wonderful it was. I already own a Maclaren XLR and wanted to downsize to a sturdy smaller stroller b/c the Maclaren is too heavy. After I bought the stroller online and pushed my baby around in it, I realized I didn't like it (Babies R Us didn't have one to test out) b/c my feet kept kicking the back wheels every time I took a step (and I'm only 5 ft!). And it was totally front heavy. It was much more difficult to maneuver than my $20 Babies R US stroller (which I LOVED, but it got worn out after a year...hence the search for a better quality umbrella stroller). I wished I had sucked it up and bought a Maclaren Triumph.Update-I ended up buying a used Maclaren Triumph (I HIGHly recommend this!) and keeping the Chicco umbrella stroller. One for the car and one for at home. The only things I liked about the Chicco are the color (beautiful blue!),the sturdiness, canopy, bag, and price."
1901,SE Small Pill/ID Holder Keychain (Set of 6),0/0,4.0,Can't wait to hide these buggers! These will be triky for people to find I can tell! Cool product! Thanks!
1902,REGDAB Airbrush Lubricant 1 oz.,0/0,5.0,"Using it on my Iwata CR, seems to work great and you get more (Iwata lube is .3oz & costs more). Purchased mine from Cream City Hobbies, good seller/shipper."
1903,Omron Body Logic Fat Loss Monitor model HBF-306C(Silver),1/1,3.0,"The fat percentage seems right to me given what I see in the mirror, but for the life of me I have no idea why this things also tells you BMI, which is simply generated from the standard height weight calculation and is the exact sort of useless number you buy one of these to replace. I wish I had bought one that also estimates hydration, since differences in hydration can affect the numbers this spits out. If you already have a scale you like, this is an okay choice, if not get a scale that does this too."
1904,Moom Nourishing Hair Remover,0/0,5.0,"I love this stuff! I bought some years ago because I was sick and tired of spending an hour in the bathroom plucking my eyebrows one by one. Too time consuming and it was always painful. Wax... well, after seeing my mother use it on herself (and I still can't get the smell of microwaved wax out of my memory, ewww!) and how she struggled with it, I never wanted to even try that stuff. So I'm so glad I found Moom. It works very much the same way as wax, but smells much better and doesn't hurt nearly as much as I was afraid it would. Not going to lie, it is going to hurt a bit. You are ripping little hairs from your body, it's just inevitable there will be pain of some sort.Moom is nice in that you don't HAVE to heat it up, but there have been times during colder months that I find it's more solid than usual. In that event, I do pop it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds and then wait for it cool down a bit before I use it on my skin. The muslin strips are also a nice touch. There are two sizes of strips- small and HUGE and I rarely ever need to use the latter. It includes two sizes of ""applicators"" as well which are really nothing more than wooden popsicle sticks or tongue depressors, again one set thin and the other wide (I use the thin one). The sticks and fabrics bits are easy to clean, just use soap and water and let them air dry.Moom is easy to apply, almost too easy. I'd caution anyone who uses it that LESS IS MORE! You can always remove more hair, you can't replace it once it's gone nearly as easily so take your time and apply with care. Oh yeah, remember to wash your face BEFORE you use it. You really do need to remove any natural oils otherwise it won't work nearly as well (I've forgotten a few times with frustrating results). And always have some moisturizer on hand afterwards to apply to the spots where hair was removed, it will be tender and might get dried out. Moisturizer will help that. Definitely recommended!"
1905,Bioderma Crealine H2o Ultra-mild Non-rinse Face and Eyes Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"I found out about this product from Lisa Eldridge who is one of the top makeup artists in the world.[...]I feel that if she uses it everyday it must be good because since she has access to so many products and also because she is in the industry she has tried many. So I gave it a try. I used to use the Clinique eye make up remover and comparing the two, I found that the Clinique one was too oily and could have the tendency to get in my pours and cause problems. The Bioderma Crealine H20 solution feels like plain water but it takes all makeup off within seconds. If I have false lashes on all I do is apply some to a square cotton pad, press pad on eye for about a minute then just slide the pad down everything comes off without any rubbing or pulling your eye. Plus, it helps to not wreak the lashes so you can use them again and again. It is an amazing product. We all know it is so important to not rub the eye area anyway. We want to prevent wrinkles not make them!"
1906,Nestle Quality Street,1/2,1.0,They sent me this package on 10/24/12 which has an expiry date of 11/2012. I would not have bought if it was from a store.
1907,Yerba Prima Psyllium Whole Husks,1/1,5.0,This product has been working great for a few weeks but the real test came after last night. I had Chinese food and a bunch of beers and when I went to the bathroom this morning it was business as usual. It was unheard of. I highly recommend this product. Life changing .
1908,duri Miracote .61oz,0/0,1.0,It was as if it was a nailpolish designed to chip. The topcoat allowed me to literally peel of any nailpolish I put on. It was terrible I wish I could get my money back.
1909,Venus Liquidity Art & Motion Item 2361 (Colors May Vary),0/0,1.0,This item is much smaller than it appears. It is made out of cheap plastic and you could probably purchase something of similar quality at the dollar store. The entire black side does not work at all on ours. I see that I can ship it back but there are no exchanges.
1910,HAND MEDIC -- 8 OZ.,0/0,4.0,"I love this product. Works great for rough hands...especially if you wash often. I have noticed if you leave the pump bottle in direct sunlight, because it is black, it can sometimes expand and leak out the pump nozzle....with the bottle was white!"
1911,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,1/1,3.0,That's all I can say. Lathers better and is thicker Doc Woods. I will try another brand the next time I order. This was relatively inexpensive given how much I paid for the inferior Doc Woods product earlier.
1912,"Ricochet Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint, 100-Count Mints (Pack of 6)",1/1,5.0,"These mints are made exclusively with xylitol. Almost all other mints have sugar and artificial sweetners, which oddly enough can give you bad breath as the leftover sugar feeds bacteria in your mouth. Bacteria don't like xylitol, which makes these mints perfect for oral health. They also taste great!"
1913,Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Freezer Trays With Lids,0/0,5.0,"I bought these so I could store homemade baby food and I like them a lot. It's a great deal comparing to other baby food freezing trays.I was a little concerned when I read the negative review about:1. how it's hard to get the cubes out2.how the tray cracks easily3. The cover does not fit.Well, these problems are nothing to worry about.First of all, when you get the trays, it says in the manual if the cover does not fit right, submerge it in hot water, then put it on the tray and let cool. This will make sure the cover fit perfectly. I did this since the covers were a bit hard to put on, and it worked out perfectly.Second, like other reviews mentioned, when you are getting the cubes out, you need to run it under hot water for 30 seconds or so, then it's so easy to get them out.This bring the third thing,the trays are hard, not flexible, so you can't twist it to get the cubes out. Like I mentioned, I run the frozen tray under hot water, flip the tray so the cover is at the bottom, then I smash it lightly on the counter top, you could hear the cubes got loosened from the tray. Most importantly, NO CRACKS."
1914,Munchkin Three Stay Put 3-Pack Suction Bowl,0/0,3.0,"my biggest complaint is that the design of the smallest bowl doesn't allow the suction cup to really stick. the other's stick fairly well. my 1 year old can still pull them off of her tray sometimes but like someone else mentioned, they are good for holding the bowl in place while she is using her spoon by herself. i often have to press them down several times to resuction but that is fine. i'm pretty happy with these bowls aside from the suction being useless on the small blue bowl."
1915,"Max Factor MAXeye Shadows, 0.12-Ounce Packages",0/0,5.0,"I shave my head, and I used to get razor bumps, particularly on the back of my head. I tried many aftershaves to no avail, I read a review about tend skin and tried it. My head cleaned up in a matter of days and have not had any since. I never realized how dirty one's head is. Tend Skin cleans it all up and leaves you with smooth clean skin."
1916,OSCAR For Women By OSCAR DE LA RENTA Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,"I have been in love with this scent for over 30 years, matter of fact it is the only fragrance I use. The spray bottle saves in longer lasting value. The price with amazon is the best you can get. It was packaged correctly and you can buy it for a gift or yourself. I do both mostly during Christmas gifts. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
1917,Andis 29775 Headliner Trimmer,0/0,5.0,This trimmer met all my expectations... it's easy to use.. powerful.. and the on/off switch is very convienient when using it.. I have a beard that I like to get creative with.. and the om/off switch makes it easy to stop and check the progress of my latest design without worrying about messing it up because of a mistake handleing the trimmer!
1918,Dome Top Parrot Cage with Stand,0/0,1.0,I would rare it a zero if that was an option. No one has contacted me to tell me why it is not here
1919,Tend Skin,0/0,5.0,"I shave my head, and I used to get razor bumps, particularly on the back of my head. I tried many aftershaves to no avail, I read a review about tend skin and tried it.

1920,Conair Pro Universal Finger Diffuser,0/0,5.0,"The diffuser works well on one of my hair dryers, but not both. It simply needs a long enough shaft to fit onto. The ""springs"" inside fit snugly so it does not fall off. Great buy!"
1921,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats",0/0,5.0,"My dog would do anything for his liver treats! ...and whenever any of his playmates are out for a walk they drag their owners to our house so they can have a liver treat as well (in fact most of their owners now buy it for them). It is healthy, a great training treat, and they all love it!"
1922,PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack),0/0,5.0,"I couldn't find this anywhere. Lowes sold the system, but no replacement batteries. The pet stores in my area didn't carry them. I'm really glad I could find them online at least. I recommend getting a few extras incase."
1923,Ring-Neck Pheasant - Audubon Plush Bird (Authentic Bird Sound),0/0,5.0,"Why not make the review request of this item more involved. People might want to spend hours to tell the world that this damn bird isgreat looking, educational,healthy, political correct, etc. etc. etc. I would just love to receive hundreds of emails from peoplewho want to waste their time to send commends to me relating my review and kind description of this stupid bird !For God'd sake get some live and don't wast time of your customers."
1924,PoochPad Pet Training Pad,0/0,5.0,Purchased for my handicapped and semi-incontinent cat. The pads absorb urine and odor very well and hold up well to clawing and regular laundering.
1925,Tourniquet Latex-Free (Pack of 10) Disposable,0/1,3.0,I was happy with this product b i dont like going to get blood drawn from me and they are using same tournaquet.
1926,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",3/3,1.0,This noise maker added more sounds than what it is supposed to. I tried all sound options and the same thing happened throughout the night. My husband and I tested it in the daytime to see if sounds were not as they stated. Sent it back. Very disappointed.
1927,Vicks Baby Rectal Thermometer,1/1,1.0,"It will not turn on! Haven't replaced the battery yet, but I am just so frustrated that in the middle of the night when I needed it (just after being shipped) it would not turn on! Had to run to Safeway at 2am to replace it. Not happy."
1928,Smokin' Hot For Men 2oz Fragrance Spray Cologne,0/0,5.0,This is a great product. Not very expensive and smells exactly like Armani Code. Also it got to me on time.
1929,Duro-Med Heavy-Duty Sliding Transfer Bench with Cut-Out Seat,0/0,1.0,"I ordered this product about a month ago for my brother who weighs about 200 lbs. When he was trying to transfer, the cut out would pop up out of place and cause him to nearly fall. Then we epoxied the cut out in place, then the notch which is suposed to keep it from falling through broke off and once again it was not secure."
1930,Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer,1/1,5.0,"I'm not going to say a lot about this little trimmer, you can read all the other reviews about it. A+ get it, you'll be happy."
1931,Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond Tingle Hot Sizzle Indoor Tanning Salon Tan Lotion 8.5 fl oz.,0/0,5.0,My wife has used many different indoor tanning lotions. She tells me that she does not use much of this product for each application thus the bottle will last for quite while. She loves the natural color that this product produces after getting out of a tanning bed. It's the best!
1932,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this polish in white (blanc). I was worried that like some other white polishes I've seen that it would end up looking like I'd put white out on my nails. Or that the color wouldn't be a true white. But this polish went on very smooth and the color is wonderful. I've never used Essie before, but I think I've found a new favorite polish."
1933,"Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor, 100 Extra-light Natural Blonde Chamomile",0/0,3.0,"Lightened my medium-light auburn hair with dark brown roots, But made my roots a light orange blonde and a darker orange for the rest! I look crazy!!!!! :("
1934,Clinique Stay-True Makeup Oil-Free Formula,0/0,5.0,"I have used Clinique Stay-Ture Makepu Oil Free Formula 03 Stay Beige for 20 years.BUT at $199.50 that is really taking advantage of customers! A couple of weeks ago I bought it at $22.00 a bottle on Amazon. Clinique has discontinued this product, so I hope no one buys it from you."
1935,Coralife Aqualight T5 Freshwater Dual Lamp Fixture,0/0,1.0,"So I ordered one of these, 30 inch versions of the Coralife dual strip for freshwater, which comes with a 6700K and ColorMax bulb. Within 12 hours, the 6700K bulb stopped lighting up. Amazon replaced it. The 6700K bulb on the replacement unit blew within 24-48 hours of use. Total garbage. Apparently this model (T5NO) has known issues and is no longer being manufactured. If this model is defective, then why is this item even being sold on Amazon?"
1936,Glyco Flex III (120 Tablets),0/0,5.0,they have a fair price and arrived as promised. I have ordered this probably four times now. Our dog has not had any problems with the product. Who knows if it really works.
1937,Break Your Own Geodes,0/0,2.0,"These geodes were very hard to crack open. It took several good whacks with a hammer to crack them and then they tended to fly into lots of tiny pieces. They were interesting to look at once open, but not very colorful. Mostly just darker shades of grey. I'm not an expert in any form of geodes, but these were not at all what I expected."
1938,Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller,0/0,4.0,"The absolute best investment for twins! I don't leave home without it. Very user friendly, convenient and durable. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a cup holder for the rear seat and the tray is more like a guard rail than something helpful for holding drinks and/or snacks."
1939,Vicks Cough Drops Menthol - 20 Drops/pack,0/0,5.0,"I have allergies to dust, mold and mildew which means I get to coughing about every time it rains. These Vicks cough drops are the only kind that clears my throat. I like these rather than using cold medicines. These are great life saver for me to make me comfortable."
1940,Melissa & Doug Geometric Stacker,2/3,5.0,"I bought this toy for me. Why? Remove two of the stacks (I remove all but the round ones), take off the top piece, and voila, you've got the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. I gave the pieces I didn't need to my baby to use with her single stacker, that came with just the round ones, and she can stack any of the three sets. My five year old still plays with it creatively. After about 7 years, the pieces have held up rather well, but some of the paint has come off---not all, or even most, but I wouldn't want to give it to a teething kid. [Towers of Hanoi puzzle"

Great buy."
1942,Fantasia IC Leave-In Moisturizer Hair and Scalp Treatment Extra Dry Hair Formula Aloe Complex 16oz,0/0,5.0,I love this product and am so happy to see that it is available again. It works for me when other products don't.
1943,Ambimed Inc Inject-ease Automatic Injector -Injections Made Easy,0/0,4.0,"I almost returned this product before I spoke with someone who has used something similar. So glad I didn't. I dread giving myself injections. Eventhough I know the pain is quick and minor, I still struggle to stick the needle in my body. This is a sure stress reliever. The first time, even using this, I hesitaed before pushing the button. But after doing it once and realizing that I didn't even realize the needle had penetrated my skin, I no longer hesitate at all. Great little product and well worth it, just to relieve the anxiety associated with a self stick."
1944,Source Naturals Pycnogenol 100mg,2/2,5.0,"I read that this may help for hot flashes so thought I would try them. After having breast cancer I have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years and got bad hot flashes many times a day. After taking Pycnogenol my hot flashes lessened greatly, and if I am in a cooler temperature, I don't have them at all. What a lifesaver. I told my doctor about this and she said she would recommend it to other women on Tamoxifen."
1945,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Doll Furniture - Bed,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It was simple to assemble and looks great. She absolutely loves it and there is always at least one doll or soft toy ""asleep"" in it. She has even managed to lie in it herself (although we don't encourage this) and often sits on the end whilst playing. Highly recommended"
1946,Scat Mat Electronic Pet Training Mat,0/0,5.0,"Product works as described and was shipped so fast that the Amazon shipping alert came 2 days after I had received the package. I ordered 2 12x60's and they are the perfect length for my sectional. The dogs have tested it once and after 3 days, I don't even need to leave the unit on and they stay away. I am master of my couch once more."

1950,Transformers G1 Commemorative Series I Hot Rod Reissue Figure ( Rodimus Major ),1/1,5.0,"Hot Rod is my favorite Transformers Character of all time. When I was little I begged and begged my parents for Hot Rod for Christmas,my birthday and every other holiday and I never did get him. Finally upon High school graduation I got two gifts. One of which was a Gibson Les Paul modeled after Sully Erna's from Godsmack and...Hot Rod. Bet you can't guess which was my favorite.I was super excited to get Hot Rod finally after waiting 15 fricken years.My grandma always told me ""dont worry you'll find him one day"" (I would make here sit down and watch Transformers with me...then later on actually got her into Gundam) I never did believe her. So....this is a review 15+ years in the making.Hot Rod transforms into a modified Lamborghini Countach, Red with flames on the hood and sides...and lets not forget the big yellow spoiler and chrome exaust pipes. Before I actually get into this review I'm pretending any Transformers product that came out after G1 Does not exist so I can give a better review. Vehicle mode is really nice. Rolls super well and like a lot of G1 figures holds into place very well.Hot Rod sports rubber wheels. I prefer that over plastic any day. I think it adds a more realistic touch. There is also a peg hole in the exposed engine block where you can peg in one of two weapons that Hot Rod comes with. I think it looks better with no weapons but that's just me. Vehicle mode is a little over scaled compared to Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus but Hot Rod can easily fit on Ultra Magnus's Trailer. Hot Rod is also as screen accurate as you're going to get. Some of the G1 Transformers transform ridiculously complex in the show and movie so Hasbro had to compensate in both Vehicle mode and Robot mode.Transformation is a breeze.Simply pull the legs back and flip out the toes.Flip the arms on each side so the exhaust pipes are parallel to the car.Flip out the hood, Rotate the engine block to reveal Hot Rods head and snap in place. Next Rotate his ""belt buckle"" around and bring the hood down to peg into the top of the belt buckle. Rotate the spoiler/cab section around so that the Spoiler is behind Hot Rods Shoulders.Next just pose the arms and you're done. Pretty simple.Robot mode...to this day still looks awesome!.There isn't that much poseability except in this elbows and wrists and mid bicept.Head sculpt looks great. Not like Optimus Prime's where it vaguely resembles the actually head of the bot in the show. Hot Rods is pretty much dead on.Both of Hot Rods weapons can be held. Makes him look pretty bada$$ too.Overall this is a GREAT figure. I am not being bias when I say that. This really is a must have for your collection. It's a Classic, A great looking car and robot...well...It's Hot Rod. nuff said."
1951,Innotek Lap Dog Trainer,1/1,1.0,"The collar only has 4 levels. My dog ignored level 1. He yelped and jumped for level 2. The training said a level with that reaction should only be used for behavioral corrections and not basic training. The support line was no help. No background questions of where the collar was placed or how I was trying to train to brainstorm how I could get the product to work for my dog. At minimum, I thought maybe I should loosen the collar, or move the prongs to the back of the neck, or remove one of the prongs. But there were absolutely no suggestions other than being told there was no 1.5 level, which was of course obvious.I was also concerned with the training collar coming into contact with metal on his other collars. The support line told me he should not be wearing other collars and should have a harness. No where else was this mentioned. My dog is an Italian Greyhound. His chest is too deep for a harness and must wear a martingale collar.I was told I would have to check with the retail store to return the collar. Returning the product is not an option asI had already opened the package and cut the collar as instructed (since it was so long my dog was tripping over it--too long for a product geared to lap dogs). There was no discussion that maybe the collar was defunct and that another might not have Level 2 set so strong."
1952,Source Naturals Life Force Multiple Capsules,0/0,5.0,"My wife and I have been using this vitamin for a few months now and its a very good multi vitamin. This vitamin comes with or without iron your preference just make sure you ordering the one you want. Don't be scared but it does make urging yellow cleaning you out, and the price is not bad."
1953,Laci Le Beau Laci Super Dieter''S Tea,0/2,1.0,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
1954,Metabolic Response Modifiers - Metabolic Whey - 10 lbs (4540 g),0/0,4.0,"pretty good results so far, seem to be making progress on my goals. This mixes a lot better in just water than milk, as it seems to clump more in cold liquid. One trick to mixing in either, is to stir then let sit for a minute, then sit for another minute. It may sound tedious, but it really doesn't take long. I like the taste better in water than milk; as it tastes like hot chocolate to me."
1955,California Exotics Decadent Indulgence Arouser,0/0,1.0,After purchasing a few of these. This one was the most expensive & the worst of the group. I wasted $50/
1956,LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,0/2,1.0,"This toy just arrived tonight in a larger box with 4 other packaged toys. This toy was the only one not contained in proper packaging, but rather in a plastic bag in the bottom of the larger box. No instruction booklet, no warrently info, and most importantly - the table legs are missing. It appears that whoever packged my purchases tried to get them to all fit in one larger box. They may have taken the one toy out of the original box to make it fit. Regardless, the toy is worthless as it. If there was a way to communicate with Amazon to just send the table legs, I would. I have no choice but to return the toy. What a pain!"
1957,"GOOBER BEAR 11""",0/0,5.0,Very cute and goofy looking bear. He looks so sweet and I just know his fat little tummy is hungry for more honey and that's why he looks so puzzled wondering where did all his honey go? I renamed him Bumbles Bear because he can charm the honey from all the bumble bees with just his cuteness.Why are you so puzzled? Just bee patient Mr. Bumbles Bear and soon the bees will make more honey for you to charm away!
1958,Comfort Zone with Feliway for Cats Diffuser and Single Refill,2/2,1.0,"This seemed fine for nearly two weeks of use. Ran quite warm but not hot. Then today, thankfully someone was home to notice the burning smell before it was too late. It emitted a distinct odor of burning electrical components. It was plugged in to a fully functioning outlet and was not ""sagging"" in the outlet. I believe this event could have developed into an electrical fire if not no one was home to notice the stench and unplug it in time. These are dangerous. Whether or not the pheromone is effective is a mute point here as the delivery system is hazardous. If you dare to use one of these be vigilant. I requested a return authorization based on the defective nature of the product and received a pre-paid return shipping label with no hassle so I give credit to the seller for that good customer service. Purchased from Monster Pets (Fulfilled by Amazon). Good service in spite of bad product."
1959,Lice and Nit Eliminating Natural Mousse with Foam Applicator Kit,0/0,5.0,"We experienced lice for the first time last year (my daughter caught them in her kindergarten class) and tried everything--even the poison stuff! While the essential oils and diligent combing worked better than Kwellada, none of these irradicated the little buggers. In my many trips online, I had read about professional nit removing companies using enzyme-based products to get rid of the bugs. So, I ordered this (and the Terminator comb--you must spend the few extra dollars on a good comb from the start--the drugstore ones do not last, as the ""fingers"" start to loosen and move) on Ebay and could not be happier. The bugs and eggs were gone from all of our four heads in one treatment/combing session. I am writing my review 14 months after first using this as I stopped by to find the link so that my mother, who is a school teacher, and has been feeling crawling on her head, can order her own treatment and comb! I told her not to bother with anything else as this worked like a charm. I was even able to comb everything out of my own long hair on my own (I didn't need someone to section and comb it for me--simply leaving the product on my hair and combing on my own, worked just fine!)"
1960,"4-Way Saline Spray-1, oz.",2/2,5.0,"This is a great product. Unfortunately, it is no longer in production. The sky-high prices being asked are due to limited availabilty. I have a few bottles left and then, sadly, it's off to Ocean or other salines. Enjoy."
1961,"Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces",0/0,5.0,"Just got a 10 week old English Bulldog that has a crazy strong unrelenting bite. After she got ahold of my big toe, I decided it was time to put a stop to the behavior. I ran out and bought this on sale at my local pet store (on sale for a Lincoln)and sprayed it all over me-my arms my hands & most importantly, my toes. The pup got one taste of it and was completely turned off by it. No more biting. I also followed her around and deterred her from chewing other things like wires, the couch, the stairs, the credenza, the puppy gate, teh pillows, a blanket and an ottoman. She likes to chew, but she is still pretty awesome.On the other hand, my mom has three weiner dogs. One of them decided a corner of the wall tasted delicious, so she went out & bought bitter apple. The chewer was thoroughly deterred from chewing, but in a wacky twist of fate, another weiner dog loved the taste--he would sit and lick the walls like a tootsie pop. He is a weird dog though. Adorable, but a weirdo."
1962,"Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express Golden Brown Sugar, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,I love the the brown sugar oatmeal! I wish that Target and Giant Eagle would stock it in their stores. It is a great breaksfast to take to work and micowave.
1963,"Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,"My toddler son, My wife and I all enjoy Late July Crackers. They are little bit on the salty side for our taste that's why I took one star off. But they are much healthier than the RITZ Hydrogenated oil crackers. Give them a try if you are looking for a healthier alternative to ritz for your kids or yourself."
1964,"Blue Diamond Nut-Thins Cracker Snacks, Almond, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,Those of us who must avoid gluten often have to accept mediocre flavor and texture. Nut-Thins rises above expectations with great taste and great texture. I eat them regularly in place of crackers with gluten. I highly recommend this product.
1965,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,4.0,My daughter loves her puzzles! Unfortunately the design on the pieces is a paper base so my daughter has destroyed some of them by putting them in her mouth.
1966,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,1/1,5.0,"Buy this item in april-08-2009 and work perfect. 3 year of use not problem, for methis product is 100% recomend."
1967,Revlon Age Defying Makeup with Botafirm SPF 15 Dry Skin Foundation Makeup,1/1,5.0,"I like this foundation and have worn it for years. It has light coverage, a little sunscreen which is good. Last time I got the wrong color--nude beige--which is quite fair, but I wear it anyway and it seems to blend in without making me look too ghostly. Will order a little darker next time."
1968,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"I hadn't even finished taking this toy out of the box before my cat demanded to play with it. She loves to chase me around the house with the toy and rescue her parents from the snake like string. Should I stop moving the toy around she'll start crying at me to play with her some more. This is certainly the best cat toy I've ever purchased, but beware your cat will demand constant play time once she's seen it!"
1969,Party Pooper - Fake Poop,0/0,5.0,Bought this to prank a co worker. I've had so much fun passing this item around to various people. Even when they know what it is the shock value is still funny. I only wish I would have purchased two. It's been passed around my work place I have yet to get it back. But knowing who has it isn't hard to tell I'll just follow the laughter and screaming.
1970,"Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Not only was this a great buy, this coconut is delicious. I put it on ice cream, mix it into a low-carb chocolate candy I make, mix it in fruit salads, and eat it with peanut butter and whip cream. I plan to buy this again."
1971,Travel Chinese Checkers,0/0,1.0,We had high hopes of playing with this while on the road. The set is cheaply made and the pieces are hard to handle. A disappointment overall.
1972,"3M Microfoam Foam Surgical Tape - 4"" wide",3/3,1.0,"The product works great but the company advertised the items price as ""$9.59 ($0.80 / Item)"". The ad never says how many of the item you are ordering, but when you divide $9.59 by .80 for get 12, which one would assume means you are ordering a box of 12 rolls for $9.59. Instead I got one roll, which I could have bought for a quarter of that price from dozens of other companies."
1973,Puzzle Mat Roll o Puzzle 24x36 Inch Stow and Go Green Felt with End Caps for More Storage,2/2,5.0,"Every once in a while, a product comes along that just plain makes sense! This puzzle saver is one of those ideas that you use, and immediately think ""Why did it take so long to invent this?""Larger, more complex jigsaw puzzles can take a lot of time to complete. If you don't want to dedicate a whole table to the task for days, or even weeks, this Roll-O-Puzzle mat is just the ticket.The felt makes a great surface for building the puzzle, and the unfitted pieces tend to stay where you put them. Then, when you are done for the moment, just roll it up! When you're ready to work again, simply unroll it on the table, and there's your partially completed puzzle, all set and ready for more work.Simple, effective . . . genius! Treat yourself!"
1974,T Cologne by Tommy Hilfiger for men Colognes,1/1,5.0,This cologne has a citric smell that provides a sense of freshness all day long. Had used this many many years ago and order it as soon as i came across this on amazon (this isn't manufactured anymore hence not easily available in shops). The package arrived in perfect condition and the product was as promised. Happy with the supplier and going to order one more!! :)
1975,Nature's Way Horsechestnut Standardized Extract,4/4,5.0,"I started ordering horsechestnut sometime in the fall of 2011. I was using a different brand until trying this one. I think they're both good brands but I like this one better. If you have problems with edema in your legs due to vein problems like spider veins or varicose veins then give this a try. As long as I take this twice a day, my legs feel so much better.Also try some hydrotherapy and avoid a shower head with forceful water pressure. Use a shower head that let's the water run out gently on your skin. I found that the forceful water pressure on my shower head was adding to my leg aches and circulation issues, it made them worse. When your done showering, let a little cool water or cold water run down your body or just your legs for a few minutes (not too long) or take a cool bath OR a warm bath with epsom salt.Aloe vera gel is also good for soothing leg aches due to painful varicose veins. You should also give that a try in combination with horsechestnut. And definitely research about hydrotherapy, it really does help. And good luck, I hope I've helped someone out there."
1976,Graco Pack N Play Sheet,0/6,3.0,"Hey! I purchased this pack'n'play yard because it is convertible and so multifunctional which is important for us. I must say it is not so easy to assemble it. Other cons:- the changing table is inclined to the left and nothing can be done. When you put the baby on it he will roll to the left:(- the bassinet is so hard to set up, actually my husband had to apply so much effort to establish it. I don't think any woman can do it- wheels are only on one side, thus means you cannot roll the crib to sooth your baby.- the crib is rather small especially when your baby is longPros:- it is convertible nevertheless:)- has mp3 speaking system- I love especially diaper containers on the side. This allows you to have everything within reach.Overall it's not bad and I give it 3 out of 5. Never tried play yard as of yet so cannot say much about it."
1977,"Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen, 3 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I'm a mountain biker, and live in the Caribbean, the sun really hurts here. I have use lots of different sunscreens, this one is the best, at the moment you applied you can note kind of whiten your skin but about 20 minute you won't note it. It really feels the difference with and without it."
1978,"Carlson 0930PW Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door, White",0/0,4.0,"Overall I'm happy with this gate. It was very easy to install with clear directions. It is made of metal and seems very sturdy. The only problem I have is that my 30 lb. Cattle Dog mix can fit right through the cat door! I bought the gate to keep him from getting to our cats food. He is only 6 months old, so I hope once he is full grown - maybe another 10 or 15lbs he won't be able to squeeze through! The cats love it, and having the actual door built in so we can walk through it great!"
1979,Magna-Tiles Clear Colors 100 Piece Set,0/0,5.0,We've had this set and a smaller set for a couple of years. I hesitated to buy them because my son's preschool classroom had them and I thought if we had them at home too he might get bored with them. I got them on sale at a local independent toy store but I can tell you this is the best investment I've made in ANY toy. He's built so many different things with magna tiles
1980,Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,0/0,5.0,"affordable, easy to set up and keeps my kids stuff off the floor. good size, and seems sturdy. Shipped just in time to, was gonna make daughter get rid of a bunch of toys. yay for her!"
1981,Skyfoil&#8482; Frameless Parafoil Kite,0/0,5.0,"I bought this kite because I wanted to teach some kids at A+ how to fly a kite. Because the kite will be flown by many different hands... I wanted something durable, easy, and just overall fun. This kite fit the deal perfectly...Because it is frameless you do not have to deal with the issue of frames snappingIt was easy to get in the air as long as there is a breeze and with trade winds there is almost always a breeze out.The length of string was the perfect length! long enough to amaze but short enough to quickly reel it in for another kid to have a turn.Overall a great product for the price!"
1982,"Conair 124AR Vagabond Mini Turbo 1600-Watt Dryer, Blue",0/0,3.0,"Bought this when my hair dryer finally gave up after about 15 years of use. Since I like to travel, the dual voltage is a nice feature. Unfortunately it is not obvious which way to turn the switch to change voltage and the instructions don't mention it, so you have to try it out to see. Once that's solved, however, the hot setting is quite strong and should make short work of drying even long hair. It's worth the price paid, packs up small, and ought to do the job. No attachments, just a very basic hair dryer with two speeds."
1983,CET Pet Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,Soft bristles on a head angled to do a proper job of brushing those back teeth. Works very well on a small mini poodle.
1984,25000 IU Vitamin E Age Renewal Moisturizing Cream by Jason 4 Ounces,0/0,4.0,"I ordered this cream to use on extremely dry heels and elbows. It has worked well and is not greasy or heavy. My only issue with this cream is that the smell is a bit offputting. Its not horrible, but it doesn't smell like sunshine and roses either. The best adjective I can come up with is ""chemically"". If the benefit is worth the smell, then buy it. It does work."
1985,"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",0/0,4.0,"Very useful, very good quality, i totally love it! i did not give it 5 stars because after three months of using it, it changes its form."
1986,"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack",0/0,1.0,"Started using this product last year with great results, then it went off the market due to the main ingredient shortage. Then about 2 months ago found it at Walgreens. Started taking it with no results, by that I mean no oily discharge after eating bad. Thought it was a bad bottle so last week bought another bottle at Costco, same thing no oily discharge. Sounds gross but that is the way you know if its working. Something has changed with this product and will no longer buy it."
1987,Ferrari Black By Ferrari For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Oz,0/0,5.0,"As with any cologne, you should probably smell it in person before buying online. Considering the cost of this at the Ferrari store, this is quite the bargain. The cologne holds up for quite a while throughout the day... I guess it depends on how much you sweat though... I don't... so there's that."
1988,Bluebonnet Nutrition Super Earth Multinutrient Formula Iron Free,0/0,5.0,"I try to order supplements smaller companies not yet bought out by larger conglomerates. I cant always to this, but I figured with so may multis out there, I could. I love that this is a whole food vitamin as well, and so far so good, No adverse reactions. The dose is 3 pills, and they are horse pills for sure, so if you have an issue with taking pills, you might want to try something else. I dont always take three a day since I take other supplements, and because of that, these are a great value."
1989,The Original 46-inch Bozo the Clown Bop Bag,0/0,2.0,"Thought this would be cute for my kids...but it started leaking air right away. We pump it up but then a few hours later it's falling over. Kids really like it, but it doesn't seem that durable!"
1990,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,5.0,"I have a 60+ pound mix (boxer/lab). He was constantly pulling me around whenever we went for walks. The trainer suggested the easy walk and I have to say ""WOW"". It really works. No more pulling during our long walks. Forced him to stay on the sidewalk and stopped him from peeing on every bush/tree/mailbox we passed.Worth the price."
1991,"Seventh Generation Automatic Dishwasher Gel, 45-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,This product works very well for us. Not sure I notice any degredation from our old brand. We now try to buy as much natural product as possible and thus recommend this cleaner.
1992,Malem Ultimate Selectable Bedwetting Alarm with Vibration - Royal Blue,3/4,5.0,"This works! Don't wait any longer if your child wets the bed. Again, don't wait any longer. Buy this product!How I wish we would have listened to this advice. Finally, after years of avoiding this issue with my son's pediatrician, we discussed this issue. After several years of making excuses for sleep overs, wearing pullups and other difficulties we decided to act rather than wait. Our pediatrician told us about the alarm, said that is was a gradual process and that we needed to stick with it. She recommended a book calledSeven Steps to Nighttime Dryness"
1993,Pals Stickers for the Tub,0/0,5.0,perfect bathtoys to keep your child entertained.. our daughter asks for them as soon as she gets in the tub - she is 2 years old.
1994,"""Marineland Penguin 200B/350B/170B/330B Rite-Size C Filter Cartridge 6 pk """,0/0,5.0,"i use these in my penguin 350 on a 55 gallon community tank. normally, i will rinse them once after 3 weeks, and then replace after another 3 weeks. since there are 2 filters in the 350, i stagger their replacement at least 2 weeks apart to avoid shocking the tank. i have had this setup running for almost a year with absolutely no issues.buying a 1- or 3-pack of these filters gets pricey over a period of time. buying them in bulk is much cheaper, and ensures you will likely have more on hand in case of an emergency, when changing both filters is required.i purchased the 6-pack from amazon at $12.09 with free prime shipping, which comes to about $2 per. at petco.com, the same 6-pack costs $18.99, or $3 per. even the 12-pack at petco runs $34.96, which is just under $3 each. at this rate, you get one for free every time you buy two via amazon vs petco. also, the 6-pack on amazon sold for as low as $9 in july, which is only $1.50 per! you just can't beat that.sorry, this review became more about the cost than the product. but, after all, cost is one of the big reasons we're here buying things at all. right?"
1995,SHI For Women By ALFRED SUNG Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,"I am a perfume Junkie! I think I use most of my money on perfumes. With that said this is one of my favorite perfumes. Its not overpowering, its romantic, sweet, floral draws people (men) to you! At least that has been my experience. I discovered it in 2007 and almost finished with my 5th bottle. That is how much I love it! Will continue buying forever!"

1998,Melissa & Doug 100-Piece Wood Blocks Set,0/0,4.0,"I ordered these colorful, wooden blocks for my toddler grandchildren. Boys and girls alike, this educational toy is a hit, and even when the kids wander away to another toy, I see that grandpa is still there building a nice tower. I would recommend this product because it is timeless, and appeals to various age groups. I'm happy with my purchase, and seemed to always be pleased when it comes from Melissa & Doug."
1999,Heritage Store Colloidal Silver Soap,3/3,5.0,"Colloidal silver has been shown to have healing and antimicrobial qualities. Part of wound therapy is attention to cleanliness and avoidance of any chance of infection. I found this soap to be both gentle (especially as compared with other therapies) and highly effective in promoting healing.The shipping was fast and, for such a well-made soap, surprisingly inexpensive."
2000,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,5.0,"When you first apply, there is a powdery smell. But shortly after applying the scent becomes warm and vanilla-ey. This is my fav scent, with love at a close second, and egyptian goddess in third."
2001,"Seio super Flow Aqua Pump, 1100-Gallon Per Hour",0/0,5.0,"Great value. Very powerful with adjustable flow. It has several mounting options. None were perfect for me, but good enough not to remove a star.It is very large. I'd only recommend it for 120 gallon or larger. It is basically just a pump in a shroud (which makes it larger than a normal water mover)."
2002,BioFreeze Pain Relief Gel,0/0,5.0,"My husband recommended this to me awhile back. I gave some to my Mom to help relieve arthritis, she said it helped a bit. Has a cold and warm side to it. Good for muscular pain, too."
2003,BSN True-Mass Ultra-Premium AM to PM Lean Mass Gainer,0/0,2.0,"I followed instructions, but did not help me much. I had a milk shake in the morning, one during the day, and one before my work out. I did increase weight the first two weeks but after that i did not see much improvement. I am trying to understand my body, i know this product does work for someone but now not for me."

2005,Manic Panic Semi- Permanent Hair Dye Fuschia Shock,0/1,1.0,I tried two different Manic Panic colors on my daughter (a blue and a pink). Neither had any effect. She has dark brown hair. I do know that since we are only using as a rise the color is not going to be bright (we are not using bleach) but.......... neither color made one bit of difference. I even tried using heat (sat her under a dryer) the second time... still nothing. Am I doing something wrong?
2006,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,I used this polish several times and am pleased with it. It is a nice color and lasts a long time.
2007,Powerform Polycentric Hinged Composite Knee Brace,0/0,5.0,This Knee brace is very well made and I am very satisfied with the item. This brace adds good support.
2008,"Fine Grit, 1lb.",0/1,1.0,"I bought this with a rock polisher, but had horrible results for the price I spent. Not sure if it is due to the grit or the polisher itself, but the results were not what I expected."
2009,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"I love this seat! I can sit it on the couch or floor and it fits great (and securly) in our chairs. We haven't traveled with it yet, but it folds on top of itself into a nice cube and with the tray cover it keeps it sanitary. I look forward to many more years out of this product."

2017,"Ettore 10012 ProSeries Brass Squeegee, 12-Inch",2/2,5.0,"I have found the solution to having streak-free windows. I have tried newspaper; vinegar, commercial products; micro-fiber towels; paper towels; box store squeegees...the list goes on. I decided to give it one last shot and ordered the Ettore squeegee...eureka! Cleaning the windows is no longer an ongoing sense of frustration. The windows are clear and clean...beautiful. I am super pleased and absolutely overjoyed with the results."
2018,Melissa & Doug Large Shapes Jumbo Puzzle,1/1,5.0,this puzzle great for my sun. he is 2 years old and he likes it very much. he can hold the large shapes very easly
2019,"Cadet 1-Pound Bully Sticks for Dogs, 4 to 6-Inch",0/0,5.0,"My dog likes them and they are much cheaper than pet people, pet smart, petco, etc etc. Only place that may be able to compete price wise is costco. It smells but not to the extent that would make me want to leave the area."
2020,Men's Formula - 60 cap,5/5,5.0,"My husband and I were trying a baby for longer than 5 yeas. I'm 40 years now, have done 5 IVF already and no babies!

2021,Merry Pet Products-Cat Washroom And Night Stand,1/1,5.0,"my main concern when ordering online is delivery time. with amazon i have placed 2 large orders within the past month and everything has come on time in bubble wrap or wrapped really well. i have had no problems with any of the products i have ordered.i will continue to shop amazon for all my needs. i would give them a 10. i love the washroom. i have 2 cats and they took to it right away with no problem. my bathroom is too small so i put it in my back bedroom which is essentially their room and it fit right in. took 30mins to put togther, just need a screwdriver."
2022,"Lipton Flavored Black Tea, Spiced Chai, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is my favorite tea and since it was no longer available in grocery stores, I began ordering it from various sellers through Amazon. I just bought 6 boxes of 20 at the ridiculous price of $46, BUT NO MORE!! For those of you who also love this tea, there is great news. Lipton has a Spiced Cinnamon Chai tea that has all but one of the same ingredients of the former Spiced Chai. So do your self a favor, keep some of your pennies in your pocket and get the same taste with Liptons Spiced Cinnamon Chai. Now this same vendor I purchased 6 boxes from is selling it for $56.00 taking advantage of the fact that we love this tea. Go back to your local grocery stores and purchase the Lipton Spiced Cinnamon Chai so that these won't also disappear from the shelves."
2023,WHITE DIAMONDS by Elizabeth Taylor For women EDT SPRAY 1 OZ(Fragrance - Fragrances),1/1,5.0,"My White Diamonds Dusting Powder just arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the size. When I ordered I wasn't sure which size to order. Also, since none of the stores around me carry dusting powder any more, I didn't know how many ounces were in a typical dusting powder container. I ordered the 2.6 oz size and was thrilled to discover the size of the container and the puff are larger than expected. The diameter of the container is 4.5 inches and 2 inches tall. This is the size I remember from days gone by. I'm very pleased with this purchase. The scent is wonderful."
2024,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,0/0,5.0,"I was using Pampers exclusively for the first 6 months and my baby started having blowouts 2 to 3 times a day. I decided to try something else. I'm so glad I gave this a try, now we deal with blowouts 2 to 3 times a week. Makes me happy."
2025,"McCormick Fajita Seasoning, Southwest, 3-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Several years ago I visited Texas and was introduced to McCormick's Fajita Seasoning. I loved it so much I bought 6 to bring home. I finally was using up the last bottle sparingly hoping I could find it again and finally went searching the web. This spice is just right for chicken and I have used it to spice up my rice and make dip too! Please bring it back as soon as possible. It was the perfect blend of pepper, onion, garlic and lime. I've never found anything to compare with it!"
2026,"Fiesta Toy Sea and Shore 18"" Platypus",0/0,5.0,I got this for a good friend of mine. He mentioned the animal platypus and I was convinced he was just making it up and being silly because I believe everything. He said NOOO I'm serious its like my favorite animal. So I looked it up and saw it was real and decided to get this for him. He loves it and named it Platy
2027,"SweetLeaf Chocolate Liquid Stevia, 2 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)",0/0,1.0,"I've been using this product for years and loved it. Okay, I loved the dark chocolate more, but that seems to have been discontinued. I opened a new bottle this morning, the first with the white label and yuck! I couldn't figure out quite what it tasted like, but another reviewer mentioned raspberry and that's pretty close. However, it's not a very tasty raspberry, and that is not the flavor of choice for coffee.I see that the picture is still showing the green label. So I may try again, but if a white label shows up, I'm sending it back."
2028,Lumiscope Support Truss,0/0,4.0,"As long as you get the sizing right, this truss works just fine. It's not a great long term solution, but if you need something to hold you over until you get a surgical solution, this will do the trick. Remember to take size low over the hips, not the waist."
2029,Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery organizer with Removable Tester,0/0,4.0,"SIMPLIFY! It's great to have batteries organized, off the shelf, and know at a glance whether or not you need a particular type of battery--and you can test it to confirm that it's still good! I saw this product in someone's home and knew that it would simplify keeping track of our batteries, and bought an extra for someone I know who appreciates practical things."
2030,Jason Natural Products Woman Wise Wild Yam,0/0,4.0,"I don't know about balancing. My hot flashes are irregular and infrequent. While I'd have preferred a more natural face cream, this one, formulated to be intensive was exactly what my skin needed.The cold weather up here has dried out my skin badly, and the skin on my face was really suffering. I picked up a jar of this because it's inexpensive and has a lot of great ingredients and hoped for the best. The first day it helped some, the second day I applied it shortly after getting out of the shower, and my skin feels normal again.After using it for a while, I've noticed my skin is very soft and moisturized, non-greasy and it seems to be non-clogging.The texture is just lovely, light, whipped and creamy. Since it did handle my cold weather dry skin very well, I do recommend it."
2031,Nu Hair For Women,1/1,1.0,Used since 6/18/12 Thinning Hair Serum and Hair Regrowth pills. Not satisfied see no difference. First bought it at a drug store who no longer carry it. Then went on Nuhair's webb site and because I have used Amazon before I ordered it through them. Don't know if it's because I am 74 years old or it just doesn't work. A waste of money. Disappointed.
2032,"Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Formula with Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and Ocean Fish (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)",0/0,5.0,"Ive been quite happy with Felidae canned products.They are reasonably inexpensive if you look at the price per oz which you should always do.The ingredients are noteworthy for several reasons.1) Because of very limited grains. Cats cant process grains but you have to have something to hold the kibble together. They use alfalfa and brown rice which is better than corn.2) No meat by-products or even 'meal'. Meal/byproducts could be anything pretty much. It could be perfectly fine organ meat that humans don't eat a lot of, so theres a good supply. It could be feathers, gristle, whatever. It's generally best to avoid when possible.3) The first seven ingredients are meat-based. This means a very limited amount of filler as an 8th ingredient could only theoretically be less than 12.5% of the whole product by weight.4) The variety of meats is also beneficial, especially inclusion of liver which is nutritious.It is a good idea to feed your cat at least some canned wet food to ensure kitty gets enough water. We also feed her some dry food as snacks, and have a pet fountain (steel) to encourage water drinking.Best of all, my cat loves it!"
2033,Mueller Jumpers Knee Support,0/0,5.0,"These were for my 12 year old daughter she says they take some getting used to, but when she is running or doing basketball she always remembers to wear them. She wears them on both knees so she said she has to wear one upsidedown so the velcro is not catching on each other otherwise they will undo each other (try it it helps). She has osgood and she says they give her relief. She has a few pair so she can keep them in multiple places like gym bag of school locker."
2034,Melissa & Doug Architectural Unit Block Set,0/0,5.0,Awesome blocks. They are super fun for kids. I also got the standard unit blocks. I like the craftmenship. The kids have tons of fun with them.

2036,Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil Concentrate with Omega-3 Fatty Acids - 400 Softgels,1/1,5.0,"For starters, this is a big ass bottle, literally, its a huge bottle, not saying that is a negative I'm just pointing that out. This recommends 3 soft gels per day. I've had other brands that say 2 per day. Who is right, I dont know. Each is a 1000mg gel and contains 300mg of the good stuff just like every other fish oil capsule Ive bought so I'll take 3 i guess. For the price you cant go wrong. I'll take the 3 a day it recommends just so I can finish the bottle faster. 400 capsules...challenge accepted!Update"
2037,"Tetra Whisper In-Tank Filter 40I with BioScrubber, 20 to 40-Gallon",0/0,5.0,This filter works great! I use several in my different frog tanks and they keep them nice and clean. This product doesn't make noise (as some can) the name Whisper is quite literally true. Having used several different types of filters over the years I have to say that this is the best one yet!
2038,American Baby Company Cotton Terry Flat Fitted Changing Pad Cover,0/0,4.0,"Very soft and nice color. Wish it fit the pad a bit better, but otherwise great for the price. Holds up well with Washington too."
2039,"PRI Folding Potty with Handles, White granite",2/2,5.0,"This seat is exactly what I wanted. It's pretty durable and I feel comfortable with my son sitting on it. I think you have to remain realistic in your expectations when you are buying a potty seat that holds a child, yet folds small enough to put in your purse. The grip on the bottom is great, the handles are great, and it lips over the edge on the toilet enough that it protects hands from touching the toilet. I think it fits better on oblong toilets, which is what most public toilets are. If there is any down side, it would be the open part on the front...don't expect a splash guard. You will have to help a little boy point things down into the toilet. I don't find it to be a problem. The hole is not as big as a standard potty seat, so it might take a little assistance adjusting for what your child ""needs to do"" in the potty. It folds dirty side in and comes with a giant ziplock bag so you don't contaminate your purse. I keep a mini Lysol with me to spray it until I get home. I'm very very pleased with this purchase!"
2040,Graco Seatbelt Locking Clip,0/0,5.0,Four years later my old car seat was in perfect shape but this clip was missing. For my new baby girl the car seat belt on the infant seat was a nightmare and realized how much I needed this. I could never find it so I purchased this one and I'm so happy I did. The infant seat is now perfectly straight and I have no worries of it tilting to the sides.
2041,L'Oreal Paris Feria Multi-Faceted Shimmering Colour,0/0,5.0,"l'OREAL PARIS FERIA IS MY FAVORITE OF ANY DO IT YOURSELF HAIR COLOR...IT LEAVES MY HAIR LOOKING NATURAL NOT DYED...I LOVE THE BIG CONDITIONER THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BOX. ENOUGH FOR SEVERAL WASHES.WHAT I LIKE THE BEST IS BEING ABLE TO BUY IT ON AMAZON.COM....I SAVE $$$ ON EACH ORDER , GET IT DELIVERED RIGHT TO MY FRONT DOOR AT THE TIME I CHOOSE AND I ALWAYS GET THE SAME COLOR I CHOSE.STORE PRICES VARY, AVAILABILITY OF YOUR HAIR COLOR IS NOT CERTAIN AND YOU PAY EXTRA BECAUSE YOU USE YOUR GAS LOVING CAR TO GO BUY IT.IT COULD'NT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS"
2042,Gymnic Rody Horse,0/0,4.0,Rody arrived when promised. Is a quality product. Our 2-year-old ganddaughter loves it. Wish that it came with its own pump.
2043,"Clear Jel, 1 lb.",0/0,2.0,"I works fine but unless you are a commercial producer the price is ridiculously high. It's at least 10 times more expensive than corn starch, which has been successfully used for likelt hundreds of years w/o a problem. I wouldn't buy it again"
2044,HALO SleepSack Wearable Blanket - Cream Micro-Fleece,0/0,5.0,My 14 month old can never keep blankets on during the night. This sleep sack has been great. I also don't have to worry about SIDS with it. Great purchase.
2045,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"This is a gorgeous royal blue. It goes on smooth without streaking. I prefer essie polish to any other brand, I have real nails and others do not last as long w/o chipping. I change my polish once a week, so I don't know how long you could go before ""having"" to change. I just like to change colors. I do know that after a week of wear there is NO sign of chipping at all. The shine on this is superb, no top coat needed. I would like to thank the seller (HOUSE OF ACCESSORY) for wonderful service! Item arrived on time and packaged so there was no chance of damage during shipment. I have had VERY BAD service from (NAIL DISCOUNT) I was not at all pleased with them! Just a tip...beware who you buy from!"

2047,"Tummy Talk Pregnancy Journal Album, Nap Thyme",0/0,5.0,This journal contained more information than we expected. When reviewing the book you get a sneak peak at a few items but it contains much more. I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.
2048,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Poor Lil' Rich Girl,0/0,5.0,"This is a gorgeous royal blue. It goes on smooth without streaking.

2049,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,1.0,"I usually buy this product at the vet, but decided to buy on line to save a few bucks. Well, it worked, for a week or two, but it is supposed to protect for much longer and break the life cycle of the fleas. Within the month, I found myself buying a different brand from a more reputable seller (still on line because I'm a sucker for a ""good deal""). I did a little on line research and apparently it is quite common to end up with imposter frontline when ordering on line -as it's supposed to only be sold by vets. I am now pretty skeptical about whether or not I really used Frontline, or a fancy fake..."
2050,Fruit Fiesta Peel,1/1,5.0,"I purchased this peel after a recommendation, I was searching for a strong natural enzyme peel and I finally found it! I use this weekly and noticed a difference after my first couple of uses. It's so much more effective than much more expensive peels that I have tried."
2051,Rodger Wireless Bedwetting Alarm System,1/3,5.0,"Bought this for my 7 year old son who is a VERY sound sleeper. Used to get up at night to wake him up to use the bathroom and it would take at least 10 minutes to rouse him. I tried not giving him anything to drink near bedtime, I tried waking him up to three times a night, I tried bribary, I tried everything I could think of! Nothing worked at all. Bought the Rodger system HOPING it would work as my son's self-esteem was taking a hit - knowing he was old enough not to wet the bed. I really did not think this would work at all. I've been trying for 2-3 years to get my son to use the bathroom at night!For the first week the alarm didn't seem to wake him much until he was already quite wet and I would hear the alarm from my room across the hall, get up and help him out.The second and third weeks he started getting out of bed on his own, turning the alarm off himself (which was near the floor by his door), and going to the bathroom, AND changing the underwear with the sensor himself (I had bought 4 pairs)! Sometimes he was pretty wet, other times, almost dry. I actually didn't hear the alarm go off because he would get up so quickly to turn it off! And he's on the top bed of a bunk bed! I asked him what made him get up so quickly lately and he told me the alarm was SOOOO annoying that he couldn't stand the noise!! (I had switched the noise from a single, more calming noise, to the rotating annoying noises).The last week my son was dry all night! And for the last 4 days he has been wearing regular underwear to bed and staying dry! (He will get up to use the bathroom if he needs to!!) It was worth every penny to have my son feel so PROUD of himself!!!"
2052,Takara Japanese Beyblade A-89 Dragoon,0/0,5.0,"CXAUTION THIS BEYBLADE IS DANGEROUS! IT LITERALLY BREAKS METAL!!! my beloved beyblade Shyx (classic) attacks with the hardest, thickest metal i had, it was shattered to pieces from this beyblade! :D i love it &lt;3"
2053,PlasmaCar Red,0/0,5.0,"The car is lightweight but well built. Not very hard to put together. Packaging suffices to get it to your door with damage. Our local target used to carry these and the one they had put together lasted several months with I am sure a lot of drive time up and down the aisle. Good for kids in the 2-5 age range. Smooth surfaces are a must in order for it to work. I would guess it would work outdoors on semi smooth surfaces like a concrete driveway but I don't think the wheels would hold up long to that kind of surface. Hardwood floors, linoleum, or finished concrete like in a garage would be best. These are usually very well priced on Amazon as well going for well below retail. At that price they are a good deal. Encourages active play and coordination skills."
2054,"Booda Comfy Perch for Birds, Colors Vary",0/0,5.0,"I've seen the comfy perch in the local pet stores, but was hesitant in buying until I had read the reviews on Amazon. Therefore I decided to order the item to be delivered, and not worry about the crowded local stores. I just received the comfy perch, and my 3 year old cockatiel gave me a like tweet. She always looks like she's smiling, (lol). I attached it inside her cage, and she step onto the perch, and seem to love the feel. I'm completely satisfied, and love that it's makes her happy. The product was also delivered super fast."
2055,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,3.0,"It's perfect for french manicure, but for use alone doesn't work, is so clear; it's like clear polish with a little shade."
2056,Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet,0/0,4.0,This is convenient and we have been using this along with a bigger playpen as alternate bed for the baby. Dont feel like buying a crib right now. This is worth the money. Only I wished this had been a little bigger in size.
2057,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,My new dentist recommended a water pic. I checked reviews and decided to try this one. My husband got one also. We both love this. Should have gotten one years ago. We feel our teeth and gums are so much healthier. Just the right pressure. It does the job. No more flossing.
2058,"Tetra 77847 Whisper Air Pump, upto 20-Gallon",1/1,5.0,"I purchased a 20-gallon air pump made by Top Fin and this was a big mistake. The unit provided a good deal of air, but the noise it made was so loud that it could be heard from two rooms away. I was lured in by the cheap price when I should have just stuck to the Tetra brand, which I finally did after returning the Top Fin 20.The Whisper 20 is what it claims to be--whisper quiet, although this is really a subjective opinion. You can still hear some slight buzzing, but compared to other air pumps, it is relatively quite. It provides a strong stream of air for your aquarium air stones or other devices. Tetra also includes a free air valve, which is a nice touch.If you're looking for a reliable and relatively silent air pump at a reasonable price, the Whisper 20 is a product to consider."
2059,Yerba Prima Psyllium Whole Husks,0/0,5.0,Does everything it promises. My wife and I take one tablespoon every morning and are very happy with the results.
2060,"Nailtiques Formula 2 Protein, .5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I came off a Shellac removal where the manicurist buffed my nails down nearly to the bed. Seriously, the tops of my nails were mis-shapened and paper-thin when she was done.Nailtiques saved the day. It hardened my nails while they grew out but didn't make them brittle. Now I use it as a base coat. Expensive, but worth it!"
2061,Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,"First off, read the ingredients, no crazy words I can't pronounce, which means it's all natural! I got the peanut butter treats for my two children"
2062,Python Aquarium Replacement Pump,0/0,4.0,"This venturi valve works well with adequate water flow from the primary source. Attached to a kitchen faucet, care must be taken to place no stress on it sideways as it is plastic and will break. Metal would be preferable but apparently not available. It would also be advantageous to have the discharge threaded for a garden hose fitting (as are the suction and supply), to facilitate discharge other then to the kitchen sink or the immediate area of the venturi. Any debris plugging the discharge requires a screw be taken out to access the discharge valve which when closed acts to resupply the aquarium. Best available for the price, just be careful."
2063,"Munchkin Twisty Teether Ball, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,Love this item. Fast shipping. Everything was as stated it would be.Perfect for little teethers. Its easy to hold and gives them several different textures to teeth on.
2064,RC18T 18B Mini T LST RS4 Silicone Shock Oil 30wt 2oz,0/0,5.0,"I use this for all of my airsoft guns (gbb), both 30wt and 50wt and they're both fantastic. Not to mention the fact that they're a quarter of the price you'd pay for ""airsoft specific"" silicon oil. Great product, cheap price."
2065,10 Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans,0/0,5.0,The Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Vannila Beans were exactly as described in the ad. They arrived promptly and I have made my first batch of homemade French Vanilla Creamer with them. They are wonderful.
2066,Amazon.com,1/1,5.0,"I received my gun a couple days ago, and i gotta say im pretty impressed with the look and feel of the gun!I used sand paper on the plastic handle and the gun itself to give it that rugged, used look.I bought this FOR Halloween specifically not to play around with. The locking mechanism where the barrel is seems a bit unreliable if you plan on spinning the gun around your finger and showing off. All in all its a great looking gun, also i forgot to mention the holster and the belt? great for a child, but i would spend some cash on some of the holsters sold here on amazon, trust me."
2067,"PowerBar Harvest Whole Grain Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)",0/1,2.0,"I was a little disappointed in the taste, I felt it had an aftertaste. I love some of the other ones just not this one."
2068,Remington SP-69 MS2 Foil Screen & Cutter Blade Head,0/0,5.0,"Item was as advertised. Was the exact replacement part needed to repair and allow continued usage of this razor. If need this part again in the future, will reorder from same. Price was more than competitive then I found in retail stores. Free shipping under prime can't be beat."
2069,"Chivers, Preserve Ginger, 12-Ounce (6 Pack)",0/0,5.0,Probably it's sacrilegious but I rely on Chivers Ginger Preserve for my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. It's not too sweet. Just right with a hit of flavor and a little kick. This stuff is magical. Why have bland sweet jelly when you can have Chivers Ginger Preserve?
2070,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/2,1.0,I was sent a ADC 609bk instead of a 603. still waiting to find out if they can cross ship a replacement.
2071,"Denman Styling Brush, Heavy Weight, 9-Row",0/0,5.0,"This is my third Denman in 30 years. They last a very long time, are easy to clean and untangle my hair with the first stroke. I've bought look-a-likes, but they don't hold up longer than a year and the rubber base cracks and you have to buy another one. I am so happy that Amazon is out there where I can buy hard to find items like the Denman Brush. Love it!"
2072,Nature's Way B-100 Complex,1/2,3.0,"I have been taking this for a couple weeks, and have not seen any clear benefits. It appears that most of it just gets peed out within an hour. It might not be designed well enough for body absorption."
2073,Safari Flea Comb with a Double Row of Teeth,0/0,4.0,Excellent flea comb. No flea can escape. Surprisingly sturdy - no teeth breakages yet after 2 months as is so common with many flea combs.
2074,Nature's Way B-100 Complex,1/2,3.0,"I have been taking this for a couple weeks, and have not seen any clear benefits. It appears that most of it just gets peed out within an hour. It might not be designed well enough for body absorption."
2075,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,0/1,3.0,"Unfortunately, I have been unable to use the heads since they turned out not be the correct model for my shaver. I thought I was careful in my selection, but found out I was wrong. Because I have opened the package I did not feel it was appropriate to return or exchange them."
2076,Dr. Tung's Products,0/0,5.0,A very good product! It's affordable and actually works! I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about their dental hygiene
2077,Funrise Gazillion Bubble 64 oz. Solution,0/0,5.0,This bottle is full of fun and more fun! If you like bubbles you will LOVE this! This gets you out of the house and having fun with bubbles!
2078,Petmate Barn Home Dog House,1/1,3.0,"I judged house size on given dimensions; house was too small because given dimensions are external, and internal dimensions are significantly smaller.They were willing to accept return for refund, but available shipping options were greater cost than house was worth. I ended up selling on craigslist to recover cost. Dimensions should be more clearly stated, including explicit interior dimensions."
2079,"Yogi Ginger, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,1.0,"I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger. The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged, I don't care whether this is organic or not, the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent. If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try ""Prince of Peace"" Honey Ginger Crystals. The aroma lights up the room, the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals, there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea."
2080,Chicco C6 Stroller,0/0,5.0,"I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4"".5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag. I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK. A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the ""basket"". I wouldn't even call it that but it's there. I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back. This is definitely the best and prettiest umbrella stroller I've had after three daughters so I'm going to enjoy it."
2081,Kaytee Soft Granule Blend Mint Pet Bedding,0/0,5.0,No complaints here. I've been using this for my rabbit's litter box for about 2 months now. I found out the cheap pine litter was very bad for the health and well-being of my rabbit and decided to try this.It definitely does the job well. Absorbs urine very well & the amount of dust and fumes/scent released from the product is minimal. Unlike the strongly aromatic pine shavings that made me sneeze every time I would change the litter box.Highly recommend this product for litter box use!
2082,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I love this color, it looks good on any hand. As soon as I saw it , I wanted it. I am so glad that I gave in and bought it, it is so perfect!"
2083,Now Foods Shea Butter,0/0,5.0,"I've used Now Shea Butter for many years and was stunned to learn that there are shea butters out there claiming to be organic, natural or unscented that have a very distinctively fragrant odor. Being very chemically sensitive it is important for me to get products that are truly fragrance free and Shea Butter measures up to my very rigid requirements that it be completely fragrance free. Also, unlike another reviewer I did not find it gritty even after rubbing it in my hands. It is very creamy after just a few seconds of rubbing my hands together. I often use it to rub my feet - not just because they can become rough but because rubbing my feet helps me sleep soundly. I highly recommend it with 5 stars."
2084,"9 Lives Chicken, Veal and Beef Tender Slices Canned Cat Food in Gravy",0/0,5.0,"My cats love most of the 9 lives flavors but, as you know, cats can be very finicky. No issues with these flavors and product was delivered in a timely manner."

2086,"Choice Organic Chai Spice Tea, 20-Count Box (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Delicious tea. This one has caffeine so I drink this when I need to wake up or stay awake. I also order one without caffeine for when I don't want to stay up all night. It's great with milk, honey and cardomom seeds. Cardamom powder will work, but the seeds keep working into the flavor. A friend from India shared this flavoring."

2088,"Remington Plastic Kennel, Extra Large, 40-Inch L by 27-Inch W by 30-Inch H, Beige/Green",0/0,5.0,This crate gave ample room for my 70lb mixed breed golden retrieverish dog to fly cross country. She didn't seem to mind the flight at all.
2089,"Mickey Mouse Cake Decorations - MICKEY MOUSE BOLD EDIBLE Candy Confetti Sprinkles for Cakes, Cupcakes & Cookies",0/0,4.0,"There is a significant amount of product in the packaging. It is inevitable as it is of sugar construction some shapes wouldn't make the trip whole. There is enough for multiple cakes if that is what you would like to use it for, and the product gives you the choice of making a variety of frosting options more fun. The item shipped quickly and well considering it was going overseas."
2090,Bowron One Pelt Gold Star Rug,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this sheepskin pelt for my newborn grandaughter and she loves it. Excellent quality, beautiful and of course very comfy."
2091,Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame,0/0,3.0,"The idea is very nice. We made the first one a bit too thick (not easy to get ""just the right thickness"") because too thin and the material is too mushy when baby's foot goes in... too thick and it will press against the glass of the frame when assembled (which we discovered only after it dried). So, second time around avoided the sticking to aluminum foil issue noted by others and used wax paper which is much better. Forgot about the fact that the rolling pin is actually a ""sticking pin"" because the materials adheres to it like glue. Best way to manage this product is to kneed as directed, then push onto wide piece of wax paper into rectangle shape, fold the other half of wax paper over it and use the rolling pin on that. Learned too late and rolling pin was covered with the material which won't come off because the wood is porous... oh well. So, at this point you have 2 utter failings (happened both times to us) of this product... sticks to aluminum foil and sticks to the rolling pin... both of which are part of the explicit instructions to use. If you do, I hope your experience is better than ours. Finally got it flat by folding wax paper over on top and then pressing with a hardback book which worked pretty well. Put our kiddos foot on it... and it stuck to her foot completely messing it up and requiring a start from scratch. Next time around, put a bit of lotion on her foot and it made imprint well and came out without any mess. In summary, great concept with terrible execution. Our home is 70 degrees, not particularly dry or humid, used on flat surface, baby's feet are clean. For us, this material has been very high maintenance, requiring almost complete deviation from the directions to get it to work. Oh yes, and when using the included ruler to cut the material and make edges straight, must be very forceful and deliberate about pressing through material, rocking back and forth to cut all the strands or it will also tear out shrapnel of material from the side, messing up your imprint. If you wait until it dries to cut the shape straight on the sides you get a weird puckering effect in the material. Overall, the directions seem simple enough but, like others who wrote reviews, perils abound when following what seems like a straightforward process. Still waiting on final product to dry. Last note... be careful how thick you make it if you are going to use the double sided tape provided because it actually adds just enough height that it might cause the top edges of the imprint to press against the inner glass of the frame and distort the foot impression :-O One star is for the creativity factor and the fact that no one else seems to have anything like this available. Otherwise, this is a 2-star product for all the problematic issues from start to finish."
2092,Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food,0/0,5.0,"My 11 year old dog developed allergies and I couldn't find anything that wasn't breaking her out. This food was the answer. It took her awhile to get use to it, but now she is fine with it and she hasn't had a rash since I started using it. So glad to have found it! And so is my dog!"
2093,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,4.0,"I purchased to trim hair on chest and stomach. I considered buying a more expensive trimmer, but I'm glad I opted for this one. It does everything I need and at a fraction of the cost. Very Pleased."
2094,Batman Squirting Orchid the Joker Action Figure 1989,0/0,5.0,"When the 1989 Batman movie & Toy Biz Batman toyline came out, I was 9yrs old. I remember that following Christmas getting Batman & Joker. They we're so awesome! Eventually, once I was in my teens for a few years, I sold some toys in yard sales & gave some to my kid neighbor. Should've kept them. Needless to say, my son & I have been collecting toys. He likes getting toys from late 70's,80's and 90's. I've recently bought this Joker toy (new in package) again. This Joker toy is awesome! He comes with his hat,cane, & bellow w/ tube, to put in his back. First you put the open end of the tube (other end attached to bellow) and then squeeze the bellow. It will fill w/ water after you quit squeezing it. Then just put the open end of the tube into/over this piece on Joker's back. Then when you squeeze the bellow again, water shoots out of his Orchid on his jacket! His legs can move & his knees bend. His arms move, but don't bend @ the elbows. His head can move left to right. This figure is a classic toy & great addition to any vintage/old school toy collector. This Joker is based off the Batman movie. Which has Jack Nicholson playing The Joker. Definitely recommend this toy to collectors of toys,comic books,ect... You may even wanna buy one boxed & one unboxed to mess around with, ha ha!"
2095,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"I love, love, love this color for the summer time! It shows off your tan really well and is a nice neon without being unattractively bright. The only reason that I don't give it five stars is that it doesn't stay on nearly as well as my other China Glaze polishes. Even after using a base coat and Seche Vite, I still have a problem with it chipping after a few days. I've had this problem with every neon I've ever owned, so I don't know if it's something to do with the color, but it is frustrating. Other than that, I am thrilled with this polish and highly recommend this color!"

2097,Bump Stopper Double Strength .5 oz. Treatment,1/1,5.0,Very good product that always produces good results for me. I get bumps quite frequently from ingrown hairs. This helps to control it nicely.
2098,"Yunnan Baiyao Capsules (16 Capsules Per 4g Box, 0.25g Per Capsule)",1/1,5.0,"I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with a bleeding disorder. My Rot has been suffering from hematuria (blood in the urine) of and on for 2 years. After numerous tests and referral to a Univeristy Hospital, we cannot determine a cause. As a result of the extensive tests, they found a very invasive rectal carcinoma. Our last resort was to due a kidney biopsy and possibly surgery to maybe remove his kidney, however due to the rectal cancer we felt it would be putting him through a procedure that was not guranateed to fix the bleeding and was not going to fix the other. At this point he was bleeding excessively, frank red blood. The university vet recommended this product to be used carefully. He was on it for 2 days and his bleeding stopped, I tappered down the dose as recommended and his urine cleared. That was in June, he's had only one episode recently when his urine started to get darker (blood tinged) so I gave him this right away for a couple of days, then tapered down. He has only had 1 episode since June, he is happy, I am not sure how long he will be with us, but at least he will be comfortable and loved. He was given 6 months, but you would never know it!. I highly recommend it, of course under the surveillance of your Veterinarian."

2100,OPTP Original McKenzie Lumbar Roll (Standard) 701,1/1,1.0,"This roll was very comfortable at first; however, after using it for less than a week it has deformed into an oval shape and offers no support. I was only using it for a couple of hours a day! My last lumbar roll lasted for years without losing shape. Very disappointed in this product."
2101,Normalizing Shampoo by Biolage - Shampoo 16.00 oz for Women,0/0,5.0,"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.This is excellent as a clarifying shampoo. It's not meant for daily use for normal/oily hair/scalp and it's not meant for too-frequent use for normal/dry hair/scalp. I have an oily scalp with normal hair, and while my scalp was fine, even with conditioner my hair started to turn to straw within 4 or 5 days. It's simply too harsh for use on its own or for more than 2 or 3 times per week with most hair types. But for use once or twice a week it's perfect. All you need is a light conditioner and you're set. It has medium-bodied texture and is lightly scented."
2102,"Capsule Connection, CAPSULE FILLER MACHINE FOR SIZE ""0""",0/0,4.0,"I bought this machine a while back. You have to read and follow the directions. If a capsule gets stuck you can use tweezers to remove it. I'm able to fill plenty of capsules to use, but I always lose a few. There are some holes on my device that are tight fitting and when I finish making the capsules and try to push them out, (the device has an easy way to do that), a few of the capsules will stick and only half the capsule will fall out. Sometimes I can still get the capsule together, but there are always some I toss in the garbage.It takes some concentration when putting the caps in the holes. If you start daydreaming you'll lose track and forget which holes you've put them in. I have a hard time telling which ones are still empty when I've done that.When you've finished, it's easy to clean up the machine. All in all I'd say I like the machine for the most part and would probably buy it again."
2103,Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,0/0,5.0,"Our 18 month year old daughter began trying to turn the stove on. We ordered these and they came within two days.

2106,Tinkertoy Classic Jumbo Set,0/1,5.0,So this morning my girls were playing with their $7 jumbo tinker toy set that we got at Fleet Farm last year and I thought I would see what kind of expansion kits there are. Seriously?! I could buy them a kindle at that price! I did send a price notice to the awesome customer service people here at Amazon because that price is so outrageous it could only be a typo.
2107,"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Dish Soap, 16-Ounce Bottles (Case of 6)",1/1,4.0,"I like this overall, but if you soak something in it too long or don't rinse it off VERY thoroughly you can taste the dish soap in your dishes later when you cook something. My husband has requested I stop using it as he can taste it in his coffee after I wash the mug. And the last time he made rice he threw it away because he said it tasted like soapy lavender.So...it's nice but you have to be really thorough with your rinsing, something I've never had to do with another dish soap before."

2109,LifeStyles - Ultra Sensitive Lubricated Condoms,0/0,4.0,"These aren't the world's thinnest, but they're still acceptably thin. And they were cheap! All 12 of them came in a small padded envelope with no other packaging, and they included a coupon code for %10 off my next purchase at some store called Condom Man. I'll probably use the coupon to buy a large variety pack. Each one expires in 2-5 years as expected. They fit me well (I'm just average) but the lubricant is only adequate for vaginal sex. If these were the only condoms in the world, I wouldn't be upset."
2110,Two Way Dog Coupler,1/1,5.0,"This is the perfect size for our two small dogs, and allows for easy control when walking them. The fact that it's not adjustable means that there is no slippage."
2111,Body Shop Cocoa Butter Body Butter 6.9 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"I have really dry skin and this body butter really helps. It's very rich. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It also has a great smell. I have been using this for both my dry skin and my stretch marks for almost a year. So far, I have not really noticed a difference for my stretch marks. However, I don't have to reapply lotion several times a day. The only places I do reapply are my knees. This is great for both day and night, but especially night because your body will absorb it and you won't wake up feeling like a snake. I use it right after a shower because I feel like I use less of the product when my body is still wet. Because it's so rich I sometimes use this as shaving creme and it works great. I love the smell, it's a very clean scent that's not too floral or sweet. I feel that the price is very good because you end up not having to use as much (especially after a bath) because it's very concentrated compared to regular lotion.Some people may this product too greasy or oily; and it can be a little on the heavy side. It's really a personal choice when it comes to how ""greasy/oily"" something feels. I like the feel of this body butter and I'll wipe some off if I feel a little too greasy. I think if you do not like that, this product may not be for you, and perhaps it would be best to try the Body Shop lotions instead of the body butter. My mother does not like this because she said it was too oily, but she likes the Vitamin E version of the body butters.Pros:1. Very rich and keeps skin smooth.2. Smells good.3. Price is worth it.Cons:1. Bit heavy."

2113,Source Naturals Diet Chitosan,0/0,5.0,"I have been using Chitosan since approximately 1994. It is an amazing way of allowing you to indulge in slightly higher fat content foods, such as chocolate or pizza, and still not add fat or pounds to your body. It is made of crustacean shells (totally natural and healthy, unless you are allergic to shell fish), and it works by binding dietary fat in the stomach and carrying it out of the body without allowing the fat to be absorbed. Maximum four capsules per meal recommendation must be observed. As far as I am concerned, it is a product I do not want to be without! I wholeheartedly recommend it for weight management/maintenance. It is not a weight loss product."
2114,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"Great color! It takes a few coats, but once it is on it looks great! This color is not a matte shade, it has a pearly sheen to it, so it's more of a summer shade."
2115,Paris Hilton Fragrances - Just Me Men Spray,0/0,4.0,"For the curiosity, I picked up Just Me... It is a great buy at just over $20.00 and should be given consideration adding to your collection. It is nothing new - basically a toned down Aqua Di (Armani) opening with a great citrus lemon(y) scent that settles to a clean fresh showered scent. Very nice. There is a ""but"" - the scent, at least coupled with my body chemistry, does not last. If you have an extensive collection - no problem - take the bottle with you and reapply as needed. While no compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, my girlfriend does like smelling the fragrance just following the initial application.Given the fresh/cleanliness of the fragrance, it can be worn for any occasion. While it can also be worn anytime of year, I would imagine with citrus(y) basenotes, probably spring and summer are the best times of year for Just Me...To reiterate, Just Me is a good fresh scent that lacks staying power. All things considered, I can not give it more than 4 out of 5 stars. If you have an extensive collection, buy it - if only out of curiosity... Every day is a gift..."

2118,Maggi Tomato Noodles 95 grams,0/0,5.0,"The tomato flavor is by far my favorite flavor that Maggi makes! It is very easy to make but I do with they came out with it in the regular ""cup"" form. It's not spicy, so if you're sensitive to the hot stuff, don't worry..you'll be ok! I like to add a tad bit of salt and a tad bit of red chili pepper when I make my Maggi Tomato flavored noodles, but even without this, it's pretty good!"

2125,Uncle Milton Star Theater 2,2/2,1.0,"Somehow, I thought the stars and constellations would brightly light up. I actually bought it for part of a halloween/christmas display inside my living room. (Don't ask.) It, in fact, shows the stars IN SHADOW.The light, it warned, would glow SO BRIGHTLY, it was a danger to view directly. It is simply-at least in my case-a relatively DIM, tiny light.To insert the THREE AAA batteries, you have to remove a miniscule screw, then manually unscrew a cap. (WHY? Do they think the batteries are going to EXPLODE?)You are supposed to be able to set the sky to an exact time and date, if you like...however, I had no ""pointer"" to set ANYTHING to, even after carefully checking and double and triple checking the manual.I couldn't see ANYTHING, until I brought it into my TINY powder room-and then, it ONLY worked if I held it closely to the wall. FORGET seeing anything on the ceiling.This was the exact OPPOSITE of what I hoped for-but then, seeing the low price-I shouldn't have expected much more.The whole thing is simply bizarre...and not at all what you would imagine. I stupidly bought one for myself, one for my friend's son, and I bought a ""moon phases"" thing for her other son-same brand. I will be returning ALL of them. This gadget was so stupid, I have ZERO faith in the moon phase thingie, even though-like this-from the BOX, it looks great.Please, please, save your time and money. This thing is terrible, from beginning to end. I'm so relieved I was very careful unpacking it, so I can return it."

We have been using these for about a year now, and none (NONE!) of the bags have leaked, ripped, or broken...and we go through more trash than I care to admit. Certain generic brands may be cheaper, but these are a good mid-range bag that hold up very nicely. I prefer the 30 gallon bags for our kitchen trashcan than the 13 gallon bags, or I end up taking the trash out every day. They are also easy to tie at the top.

2131,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,The color is pretty and it is definitely neon but you will need around 4 coats to make it look true to the color in the bottle or you will need to use a white base color to make the color pop. I gave it a 3 because it is a bit sheer and you have to layer it on to get it to look opaque.

2134,"Hai Classic Convertible Ceramic Flat Iron, 1-1/4 Inch",1/1,3.0,Hai is the only brand of flat iron I've ever used. This is my third one and the only one I've had a problem with. It does an excellent job straightening my very curly hair but it pulls out strands of hair because they get caught in the ceramic plates. The price is very reasonable for the way it performs - if it didn't pull out my hair I would give it 5 stars.

2137,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,3/3,5.0,"Here are the most common concerns I hear from my friends when I rave about my diva cup:1. It looks like it hurts.It doesn't hurt at all. It's a little awkward putting it in the first time, sure. But by the third time, I was a pro. And I'm one of those girls that hates speculums and cried putting in a tampon for the first time. No joke. It's soft and malleable and gets even softer with your body heat.2. I don't like looking at blood.Ok, if you're squeamish, this may not be the best product for you. You have to empty it out in the toilet (though you can just not look). But in my opinion, if you're female... get over it. It's a natural part of life and you will have to look at blood at least once a month for over 30 years of your life (around there). And hey, this way you won't have dirty pads and tampons hanging out in your bathroom (your roommates and/or significant other will thank you, I'm sure).3. It can't handle heavy flow.My friend and I have HEAVY flows. I can go through a tampon in 45 minutes. This is a lifesaver for heavy flows! I just suggest that on your heaviest days (and definitely if you are new to the Diva Cup) you wear a pantyliner to protect your underwear just in case.4. Public toilets?!Been there. I just empty it, wipe it with toilet paper, and put it back in. Don't even skip a beat. And how often are you using public toilets really? You can wear it up to TWELVE hours. Unless you have a heavy flow, you can last an entire work day without thinking about your period. Sweet.5. Is it sanitary?Silicone is inert, so you don't have to worry about developing an allergy or sensitivity. AND definitely far more safe than tampons.. toxic shock anyone? I consider it more sanitary than pads though.. where you are essentially sitting on your own blood all day. Sure, they're absorbent, but your blood is still exposed to air and bacteria. ALSO they are contributing to those islands of trash we are creating.6. Sex.Non-penetrative sex during your period. Need I say more?"

2142,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"I've grown up with cats and worked with them at a job for years, and cats love this kind of toy! Any variation like this one, or ones with a feather at the end, etc. are great. I love this one because its soft, colorful, inexpensive, and is really durable! My cat pulls at it pretty hard and it does not snap. This toy is also great to help bring shy cats out of their ""shell"". Just a tip...put the toy away when you're done with it! This way, the cat will get excited every time you bring it out. Sort of makes it a new toy, haha. Buy this!"

2144,100% All Natural Whey,0/0,5.0,"I love this whey protein. I have been buying it for a few years now and have not tried anything that comes close. I mix it in with everything! In to my oatmeal, my pancakes, homemade ice cream, baked goods...and my smoothies of course! It still tastes good just mixed with water in your blender bottle. I wish they would sell this in bulk at Costco! I go through it way too fast."
2145,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,5.0,"Philips Norelco beard trimmers are a brand I've always gone with. I've had one that was just like this one but gray (an older model from Costco) I got this for under $20 brand new with new accessories and it's basically the upgraded version of what I've been using. It grooms all beard styles nicely, I change it up often and have used it to carve just about every weird and wacky design possible. 2 thumbs up indeed!"

They tried to get me on Crestor, but I wasn't going to do something that drastic just because my cholesterol was over 100 and i am diabetic. This was a good alternative, and I take 1 or 2 a day before meals."

2148,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,4.0,"Love this harness. My dog is an absolute sweetheart, but pulls as hard as she can fulltime when going for a walk. Made walking her a chore instead of a source of enjoyment. Put the harness on her and first walk was night and day. Any move toward pulling and she instantly self corrects. It is nice to see pulling causing her frustration instead of me! 4 stars because it is a little tough to get the chest strap right and sometimes dog can get leash on wrong side of harness and then you have to move to get it back on the correct side."
2149,Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel,1/2,1.0,"I'm not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth. Yes, I'm talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here have complained about. I bought this based on all the rave reviews only to find out it's no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands. No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing else.Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better. I suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake. Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin."
2150,Stork Craft Aspen 5 Drawer Chest,0/0,5.0,I love the dresser but it was very complicated to put together. It looks very classy and looks wonderful in the room. very heavy and seems that it will last for a very long time.
2151,Bamboo Rotating Medium Course Tooth Dog Comb (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,"This comb is comfortable to hold, and slides easily through my mini poodle's curly fur (she has a fairy short cut at present). I like that the tines are rounded so not sharp against her skin. She seems to enjoy being combed with it. I just do a little every evening when she's chilled out in my lap. I'm hoping that combing several times a week with it will prevent mats when her fur grows longer. If I used a comb, I'd by one to use on myself."
2152,Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo w/ New Packaging,1/1,5.0,"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled, uncolored and normal hair, but with oily and acne-prone scalp and skin.I was nervous about using this shampoo; so much so that I decided to wait until the weekend to use it in case I needed to wash it out quickly. Though I don't have sensitive skin in the least (thank goodness) some of the primary ingredients can cause irritation, redness and itching or burning on even the toughest of hides. The scent is rather strongly medicinal, and strongly scented products can trigger migraines in me. I also wasn't sure how some of the oils in it would affect my acne-prone skin. I pretty much NEVER blow-dry my hair, preferring to make time to let it air dry, since it isn't that thick. So I had some reservations going into this. But much to my surprise, it made my hair soft, smooth and very easy to brush after it dried, without making it the least bit oily-looking, even on the second day! It also had no ill effect on my skin or scalp; no itching or burning, no clogged pores or pimples. I never use a rinse-out conditioner, but I do use a leave-in on the ends of my hair, and that was all I needed. I wouldn't use this every day, but I don't see why anyone else couldn't, provided they don't have very sensitive or dry skin or hair. It's probably especially good for those with skin conditions like excema. And the scent, while strong, gave me no headache at all; indeed, it's quite good for one's sinuses if they happen to be clogged. I can genuinely recommend this."

2156,Regalo Extra Long HideAway Bedrail,0/0,5.0,"This works wonderfully for my 20 month old son. It was very easy to install, and fits perfectly with our twin mattress. Our mattress has a very thin box spring, and it easily fits between the mattress and the box spring. I was worried by some of the other reviews saying it is difficult to assemble, but it turned out to be no problem."
2157,Cult Classics Series 1 Friday the 13th VII Jason Voorhees Action Figure,0/0,4.0,"I am a huge fan of part VII. Along with the movie it's my favorite Jason ""look"". His make up, the ripped clothes, rotting gloves, beat up hockey mask and the figure does a great job at recreating the look but just a couple things were off. Like his one eye is blue. In the film his whole eye is redish, orange. Secondly, His chain is too small around his neck & lastly the paint job is a little too light. Series 4 is a bit darker though. aside from that the figure is pretty rad!"
2158,Nature's Way Alive! Pea Shake,2/3,5.0,"Although this shake (chocolate) is very funky tasting,you can doctor it a little. Banana,peanut butter,and a little coconut butter and it improves the taste quite a bit. This can replace all veggie powders you may have as well as protein powders since its all in here. Please do not waste your money on Shakeology (90 bucks for a month!!!) This has every thing that has and more. I have gone to the bathroom more often and after a you drink this for a while you do get accustomed to the taste."

2160,Doggy Hoots Incredible Strapping Yankers Original Rainbow Trout,0/0,5.0,"This is the second trout (or as we call it, the fillet-a-fish) that I've ordered.I don't know about for big dogs, but for a an aggressive chewing 18 pound dachshund who is obsessive about playing, the first trout lasted a lot longer then most stuffed toys. It's nice and thick with heavy fabric, throws nicely and he enjoys it.I'll surely buy a third one as it's one of his favorite toys."
2161,SnackMasters California Style Turkey Jerky,0/0,5.0,Fast delivery and excellent packaging. Item as described and pictured. Delicious and organic jerkey. Wonderful flavor. I also bought this for my daughter in college and she loves this jerkey. I highly recommend and I will be purchasing more.

2163,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Baseball,0/0,5.0,Our Wheaten Terrier LOVES her baseball. She runs and chases it and loves to chomp on it. She doesn't ever sit and chew on it because we take it away from her when we are not playing fetch with her to save it as a special treat. We love all Planet Dog brand toys.
2164,Perfect Food Powder by Garden of Life 600 Grams,0/1,1.0,My Garden of Life product I purchased was stale/Old. I buy this product all the time and I saw the reviews of the company I bought it from and felt it would be a fresh product. I was wrong.
2165,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/0,5.0,I had bought two of these. The first pair was for my dad and he loves the trimmer. I would use it on my son's hair too and the cuts came out beautifully. I had bought a cheapo hair cutter that broke so I ordered myself one of these to cut my son's hair. He is 14 months old and tolerates this just fine. The 9 length settings are great and you can remove the guard to use just the blade. I would definitely recommend this product.
2166,Plan Toys Dancing Alligator,0/0,5.0,Kids love 'walking' him when we go on walks. Other big hit is pushing a baby stroller. He's a bit worn from all the usage but still functioning
2167,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,2/2,4.0,"With reasonable expectations you should be pleased with this product. Our wire-haired fox terrier always has to ""have the last bark"" with neighboring dogs (typical stubborn, willful terrier traits) -- this behavior has dramatically improved. The device works well within these paramaters:1) For our yard configuration, it's a ""line of sight"" type of device -- depending on the size of your yard, it may not impact your neighbor's dogs, random wandering bands of dogs, or your own dog if s/he is too far away (such as around the other side of the house). It has a very long cord, so I move it around every week or so, and the dog hasn't figured it out.2) It doesn't stop barking, it interrupts a barking sequence -- for it to work, you dog has to be repeatedly barking. It appears to distract the dog, taking the steam out of the barking episode. The device doesn't prevent all barking, and the dog has to get going on a string of repeated barks for impact. But, it does interrupt the cycle, and shorten the cycles for my dog. She may bark once or twice, then kind of give up - she has a weird ""half bark"" when the tone goes off, and then it's pretty much over.3) It doesn't put a big dent in ""barking for a cause"" - such as a brazen cat wandering along the fence top, taunting the dog. When there's a good reason (in dog logic) to bark vigorously, my dog is unphased by the device, initially. She does seem loose interest in the barking sooner, though.All in all, happy with the purchase, and would recommend.Update February 2013 -- still working! Dog woke me up at 5 am barking (a rarity now), but again, 4-5 barks at a time, then she basically gives up. Very happy with this result for my dog/yard combination!"
2168,"Frownies Forehead & Between Eyes, 144 Patches",0/0,5.0,"I am starting to get little wrinkles in between my eyebrows. Rather, I should say I am starting to get creases where the wrinkles will be in the future. Trying to hold back the inevitable, I bought these Frownies (on the recommendation of a friend) and have been using them at night. Every morning when I wake up, I take them off to find no creases at all. By the end of the day, they are there again, though I am learning to stop pushing my eyebrows together. It is a super simple, super inexpensive way to hold off the wrinkles. My friend had a really serious cleft in between her eyebrows and after using these for a few weeks, she has only a wrinkle where the cleft used to be, and for the depth that it was, this is a huge improvement."
2169,MAC Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation - Choose Colors -,0/0,5.0,"Super Fast Shipping. Great Seller ! Love M A C products , but dont love the prices at times.

2170,The Peepee Teepee for the Sprinkling WeeWee,0/0,3.0,"I would say these are ok if your kiddo doesn't wiggle around, but it always falls off my little man when he kicks his legs. But, it is good to have something over the wee wee and is a great, cute gift idea for those having boys. They tend to wad up when you wash them in the washer even when I put them in a lingerie bag, but that's a given since it's all cotton. The item arrive on time and in good condition"
2171,Eye Pillow -P,0/0,2.0,"Make sure you read the description carefully before ordering so you're getting what you really want. This particular pillow cannot be used with heat, unlike the sinus pillow which works both hot or cold."
2172,Grossan Hydro Pulse Nasal and Sinus Irrigation System with the Original Grossan Sinus Tip,2/2,3.0,"First of all, let me praise the use of nasal irrigation for allergy relief. I've also found that the powered ones (like both the Hydro Pulse and the SinuPulse) work better than syringes and the like.As far as I can tell there are two main units available, this Grossan unit and SinuPulse. The Grossan unit was made in Taiwan, and the SinuPulse in mainland China. I owned a Grossan unit for a couple years, lightly used during allergy season, before it died. Read the reviews -- it's apparently a fairly common problem. Upon disassembly, the cause was the motor armature binding (not burnt out, just frozen unless disassembled to the point the end cap was loose). The cheap plastic piston pump still moved fairly freely and there was no build up of salt since I had flushed the unit with distilled water after every use.A SinuPulse recently arrived -- it's far too early to tell how well it will hold up. However, I can compare the designs, ease of use, and the effectiveness.Effectiveness? They're about the same. Both also have a range of pressure adjustments and both want to be used more to the upper end.Ease of use? I'd put the Grossan unit ahead. Its fluid chamber is a fairly durable container that can serve for both mixing the salt solution and then dispense it. The SinuPulse unit has a squarish unit of a more fragile plastic (and not covered by the warranty) that doesn't work well for mixing (hard to hold, square corners, easily scratched, harder to drain). So you'll need an extra container to mix the saline solution with the SinuPulse.Design? It's a closer call on some of the design features. The SinuPulse makes it slightly easier to change nozzles with a push button to release, if that's important (not to me). The Grossan has a more useful on-off device at the handle while the SinuPulse has an annoying momentary contact (probably just presses against the tube) off option. The solution container on the Grossan unit is a more durable plastic and easier to clean, but the shut off valve on the bottom will leak now and then (not sure yet how the SinuPulse compares). Both units require a thorough flush with (preferably distilled) water to avoid salt or hard water deposits from clogging the pump. Both instruction manuals have unrealistic expectations, such as unplugging the units (they have an on-off switch) after every use.Price? About the same.Reliability? Don't have a real comparison yet. The Grossan seems to last a couple years in average use before dying. The SinuPulse has a two year warranty (versus one year for the Grossan). Both look to be somewhat cheaply made in China. Both warn that you must flush the unit after every use to get rid of any salt that might remain in the pump. If you have hard water, you probably should also use distilled water for this.The bottom line is that someone should be able to make a better unit for the $80 or so these cost. If the SinuPulse actually lasts significantly longer, it might be worth putting up with its annoyances. Otherwise, the Grossan looks to be the slightly better designed unit, at the cost of replacement every year or two or so (which will add up to a heap of broken units over a lifetime of use)."
2173,Fake Cigar,0/0,5.0,This appeared so real people actually thought I was in the party smoking a cigar LOL. Definitely recommend this accessory for anyone that needs this added to their costume.
2174,Set,0/0,5.0,"I had heard about Set for years and finally decided to try it. I am glad I did! The game is fun and fast, and quickly engaging. (I found that out when I tried it as solitaire and my husband kept playing over my shoulder.) I enjoy games that engage different thinking skills and Set does just that. I find that searching for various combos that make a set give me a bit of a brain workout. But you don't have to tell anyone it builds thinking skills--just pull it out and play, because it is just plain fun."
2175,SnugglePuppie&trade; - Brown Mutt,2/2,5.0,"We received a snuggle puppy right after our 8 week old labradoodle puppy arrived. While his first two nights were a little rough with whining, the first night with snuggle puppy he went to sleep in his crate with his mouth on her and slept all night. Five months later he wouldn't consider going to bed without his ""puppy"". We know he is ready to go to bed when he goes and gets her. In the morning the first thing he does is go back into his bed and get his ""puppy"" to bring downstairs. In times of stress (thunderstorms being alone, when his tummy was upset) he will go and get the puppy and just lie with her under his chin. Our snuggle puppy has been thrown in the wash weekly (we always redo the velcro after removing the heart), and washes up beautifully. Our big puppy is not terribly hard on his stuffed toys but we have not noticed any damage. As for the battery cost; The batteries do need to be replaced every three days if the puppy is left on most of the time. We turned it off during the day and got an extra day or two out each set. We usually would wait a night or two before replacing the batteries so that he would get used to there not being a continuous heartbeat. We purchased a lot of 50 batteries (ebay or amazon) for about $13. this lasted a little over 4 months. Now we just turn it on if he is in need of extra comfort, a new bed or when we travelled."
2176,"BaByliss Pro BAB2590 Porcelain Ceramic Straightening Iron with Removable Comb, 1.5 Inch",0/0,4.0,"I was very surprised by the quality of this flat iron, especially by the low price. I have very curly hair that snarls and can be unmanageably hard to style. I like the fact there is a comb, which is very helpful if you have curly hair. I am only giving it 4 stars as there needs to be a comb on both sides of the iron so it will do a better job to go through the hair and iron better."
2177,Surya Henna Henna Cream Light Brown,1/1,5.0,"Love this. I have been considering using henna powder but this seemed less complicated so I tried it. purchased 2 bottles. Have natural 4b hair. first experience, did not wash hair first, applied w dye brush from root to tip.. put on plastic cap and left for 1 hour. when I rinsed it the hair felt smooth, cuticles lying down, but then I washed with a clarifying shampooo and it intstantly made my hair very dry and coarse. had to use a conditioner w a lot of slip to smooth cuticle back down. minimal coloring but it was ok. Second time, thrillledddd w the result. Sectioned, detangled, braided in large sections and washed, towel dried and applied section by section w dye brush, put on 2 plastic caps and a knit hat early in the day and left it in for 6-8 hours (just went about my day), rinsed and washed with Just As I Am Coconut Co-wash... hair silk dark and SHINY!!! wow... used a light leave in and did a BnC (Braid Out and Curl) very shiny pretty. At night, generously applied whipped Shea Butter and Monoi Split End repairer and ""pineappled"". Hair fluffy, curly dark and shiny. love it!"
2178,"Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 8.5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,My nail salon uses the neutrogena body oil and I had the hardest time finding it until amazon. It is lightly scented and goes on so smooth. My skin feels amazing even hours after I applied. I'm so happy amazon sells this!

2180,RAFFINEE For Women Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"I've been wearing Raffinee for years and to this day, I'm still getting comments. I love it. It cost more at stores. That's why I order it online and you can't beat the price."
2181,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure,1/1,5.0,I have never used this product before but after reading a few reviews I decided to try it. That was a good decision.
2182,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,1.0,"What seemed like a novel idea, to filter and catch do-do and clumped litter by rolling the whole box, turns out to be a bad idea. The moist portions of the litter cling to the sides and the filter grille, and the clumps won't go into the collection tray. The tray then fills up with unused litter, wasting it. The area available for the cat to actually use is small, even though the box is huge, because the 'working' section takes up over a third of the usable internal space. The fasteners are very flimsy and tricky to use. The side entry makes it awkward to place the unit in a recessed space. In fact, the Omega Paw is more work to use than a traditional litter box. So I have taken the guts out and am using it as a regular box until my replacement, a standard covered box, arrives and I can throw this Omega Paw in the dumpster. A shame I threw my relatively new traditional box away when this thing arrived."
2183,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,Great toy . Our dog crazy about it. Lets them be a little mentally challenged. Our dog tends to be a chewer so not as long lasting as we would like but affordable to replace and it's the favorite go to toy
2184,Mary Kay Oil Mattifier,0/0,3.0,"Doesn't soak up the oil for long, but I have extremely oily skin. This will work great for moderately oily skin."
2185,Roux Fanci Full Rinse #32 Lucky Copper 15 oz,0/0,3.0,"I have light brown hair with a few blonde highlights and I used the Lucky Copper color on it as per the bottle instructions, applying it to damp hair. Unfortunately, I think because the rinse is not very dark, I couldn't really tell any difference in color. I re-applied it to dry hair (on top of what I had already put on it) and pretty much soaked my hair with it. It gave a very subtle wash of color. Some things to note:1) I could only tell it was kind of redish at the roots and scalp, possibly because it stuck better to my scalp than it did to my hair, otherwise it slightly darkened my hair.2) It has some styling power! I let it air-dry and it had that ""crunchy"" feeling before brushed.3) I did not wear gloves, and it did not stain my hands, but it did get under my nails which was a pain to get rid of.4) It will wear off before washing. I now have a rusty color all over the sweater I wore today and whenever I run my hands through my hair, they end up orange and sticky.5) It may be related to the sheer amount of product I had to use, but it did end up with a horrible but faint smell kind of like chemicals/burnt flesh.6) I have hip-legnth hair and It took about 1/3 of the bottle to coat it all.Overall, I probably won't try to color all of my head again because it dosen't work so well and smells bad. I may just do my top layer of hair or give some streaks into it. It does not drastically change the color of the hair. I think I may try the chocolate brown next to see if that gives more of a change."
2186,Depend Adjustable Underwear,0/0,5.0,"As stated by other reviewers, this is a great product that fills a need.You have to be careful that you study the package and get this one withthe tabs - Depends has another that is a large diaper-like product thatalso has velcro tabs that look similiar. Before I ordered online- which Iusually do for home health products- I went to my grocery storeand found these on the shelves for $ 12. My drug store also has a limitedsupply for about the same price. So look around- having a steady supply isimportant, but the cost difference may make adding it to your local storelist worth it."
2187,Graco Pack N Play Sheet,0/0,5.0,"This crib sheet works much better than the jersey one we also purchased. After several washings, it isn't showing any signs of wearing out and still fits correctly. The jersey sheet stretched out and sags/bunches in the middle."
2188,Multipet Look Who's Talking Chimp Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"The talking trio (frog, monkey, and cow) are winner toys as far as our Lhasa is concerned. She loves her toys and they wear out rather than get destroyed. She loves soft squeaker toys and talking toys. I guess the talking monkey screams would drive some owners crazy but in my case, knowing where she is and what she is doing is more important than listening to ""talking"" dog toys. The monkey is holding up to shaking, carrying, kissing, and using as a pillow. They were packaged very well and arrived before estimated delivery date. If you dog doesn't demolish toys, this could be a winner toy for your pet too."
2189,Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Left Brace with Dorsal Stay,1/1,4.0,"This is an aesthetically pleasing, well-built, durable product. I have noticed trouble compared to other braces in getting a good fit that applies enough pressure without cutting off circulation. However this has gotten a bit better over time, so I think it's fair to say this brace has a bit of a ""break in"" period.The brace does an excellent job of wicking away moisture, which helps keep bad odor buildup to a minimum.It's important to remember that braces like these are damage control, *not* treatment. Wear it while you sleep; wear it during your most aggravating activities. But make sure you get in plenty of time without a brace like this one. Especially if you developed your wrist issue through repetitive gripping/finger-pushing activities, it is likely that you have issues further up your arm which a brace like this will only mask. Still explore things like massage, nerve/tendon ""flossing"" exercises, and strengthening your extendor muscles. I also recommend Penetrex which you can find for sale here on Amazon. Good luck!"

So, I started my first bottle and before I finished it (and without prompting), my hair stylist said, ""your hair is getting thicker!"".After months and months of trying other manufacturers, I am ordering my second month today! Thank you Hair ReVive and I hope others receive the same benefits!!"

2195,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,4.0,"Beetlejuice is in my opinion a classic film with not enough Michael Keaton. Although he is the titular character, this story is more about the characters Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and their struggles in dealing with the afterlife. After their early death in the movie, they have to stay in their house for a certain amount of time before they can 'move on' but things go horribly wrong when a modern, city couple and their moody daughter move in.Without spoiling too much, I'll let you know that Beetlejuice still holds up very well today. The story is fun, the effects are a little cheesy but not horrible, and the comedy is almost nonstop. I gave it 4 stars due to the lightning of the film being poor in some areas. I kept hoping someone would bust out a flashlight during the dinner scenes. Overall, you are certain to enjoy this movie, especially if you're trying to see it as part of a Halloween marathon as I did!"
2196,Olay Olay Body Wash Body Butter Ribbons,0/0,2.0,i dont like olay products. the body wash leaves my skin oily. yuk! it smelled ok but it had no name.
2197,American Crew Fiber,0/0,5.0,"I never really used American Crew before. However, I was told that it was a great way to get the messy spiky look. It's pricey but for the end result I didn't mind paying the extra money. It works just as described."
2198,Aura Cacia Pure Essential Oil Lavender -- 2 fl oz,0/4,2.0,"I was told real lavender essential oil will smell very very strong. The bottom I received smell pretty weak, even if I sniff right at the bottle opening."
2199,Cinnamon Soft Mask (Acne Scar) 60g/pkg,1/1,5.0,I love this product and it will last you a very long time. You only need a little since you are just using it for your face. I added some drops of lemon oil to the mixture and put it on my face while I slept and when I woke up my skin looked amazing! It was so smooth and you couldn't even see my pores! It reduced my pores so much! I will definitely buy this product again! I highly recommend it if you have enlarged pores or if you have scarring. It works very well.
2200,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,4.0,"Bed is thinner then I expected, but overall comfortable for dog and attractive, I would get a thicker bed for an older dog. The fact that you can throw the whole thing in the wash is an awesome feature!"
2201,HoMedics QRM-400 Quad Roller Massaging Cushion with Traveling Shiatsu Massage,0/0,4.0,Got this for my wife as a gift on her birthday and she loved it. Great quality and does what it says for a good price. I would recommend!
2202,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,1/1,5.0,"The XS coat fit my 5 lb Chihuahua perfectly! She measures 10"" from the base of the neck to the base of the tail and her chest girth is 14"". The coat is very cute and excellent quality. It is very easy to put on/take off quickly. I wish they made an XXS in this style for my 3 lb Chihuahua."
2203,bumGenius 3.0 One-Size Cloth Diaper,0/0,2.0,"I have used the 3.0 with aplex closures for almost 3 yrs, and two babies. The diaper materials and inserts have held up well overall. However, the aplex is a disappointment. I have replaced it twice - once using the Bum Genius replacements and once using a stronger material from the fabric store. My own replacements worked much better. Additionally, replacing the tabs created holes in the stretch fabric to which they attach. So now that part of the diapers is beginning to fail. For the price I very much expected these diapers to be superior performers. I have added to my stash with much less expensive pocket diapers with snaps and they have performed much better. I would caution anyone who is considering investing in these diapers for use with multiple children."
2204,"Kotex Natural Balance Ultra Thin, Regular Pad 44 ct. (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,Great price for this many pads. It's hard to find thin pads without wings in the stores. Very good protection from a well known brand.
2205,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"Our Sheltie puppy LOVES this toy. We will say, ""Go get your squirrels!"" and he'll run over to the tree trunk and shake his head around until they fly out. Sometimes he'll give in and just tug them until they get loose. He plays with the squirrels individually as well and loves fetching them. A great toy to keep a dog entertained and keep him thinking! He just loves figuring out how to get the bees out. We also have the bee version of this same toy, and he loves that one just as much. Highly recommended. Only word of caution is that our dog seems to love chewing the little pieces of hair off of the squirrels' heads - so we had to give them each a haircut, and now they're back in play. :-)"

Seriously, my father has Alzheimer's disease and anything that I can do to help prevent this horrible disease...I will try it! He takes it as well and it appears to be working for him:) You can't get memory that you lost back, BUT you can prevent it from getting worse!"
2209,Diaper Dude Diaper Bag,0/0,5.0,"I just received this diaper bag in the mail as a gift. It is more than I had anticipated it being. After reading reviews I assumed that it would be a lot smaller however it turns out that this bag is just the right size. This is my second child and I messed up the first time and had a very small diaper bag. This could actually be used as a small book bag to carry books, phone, drink and pencils and things for a college student, and it looks cool too! VERY comfortable shoulder strap and the actual shoulder pad is a little more cushioned for comfort. it seems to be well insulated and the changing pad is very nice as well. overall I feel the price that was paid for this bag was VERY reasonable considering the bag is very well made and appears worth more. 5 stars all across. I got the grey and orange and love the colors! My husband does too."

2211,"CaribSea Purple Up Algae Accelerator, 16-Ounce",1/1,1.0,"After a couple of weeks of use, what appeared as purple algae ie corraline, turned out to cyano even though my phosphates are 0.03. Worse yet, my yellow tang started acting funny and I haven't seen it for 3 weeks, so I assume it died. I've stopped using it and cyano algae has halted its progress. My other fish are fine and some corals are improving. Won't ever use again and have learned to be patient...corraline takes time to grow. By the way, my pH is 8.2, nitrates =1-2, nitrites and ammonia =0, calcium 430, alk 175 ppm, magnesium = 1300."
2212,Nature's Gate Skin Therapy Lotion,0/0,5.0,"Was recommended this lotion by a friend to help heal dry, cracked skin. It works! I had tried other products and nothing seemed to totally sooth my skin. I have been using for about a month and hope it will continue it's healing ""powers"" throughout the winter! Would definitely recommend this product!"

This salt is is unrefined so it contains all of the minerals embedded with it.There is some grit to this salt since it isn't a super fine grind. This is normal and acceptable.This salt has an excellent balance of minerals enhancing all of the foods you eat naturally.This belongs in every household for your main table salt."
2218,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,4.0,"I really really loved this color for summer toenails! The texture is very odd - a little watery, which goes on streaky until you do the 2nd coat... and there's not one bit of shine once it dries. However, I always use Seche Vite as a top coat, which is super-shiny, so that solves it completely. I found that it wears as well as any other polish that doesn't start this weird, and since it's a total bargain I'm only knocking one star for it. I swear I got compliments on the color every single day I wore it! This and China Glaze Refresh-Mint (which is more of a pale Tiffany blue than mint, FYI) were the two colors I wore and loved this entire summer."
2219,Panasonic Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries - 8 Pack,1/2,5.0,I purchased these batteries for my digital camera and was pleased with the performane. I was able to almost 600 pictures with the battery. The quality of the pictures was excellent. I will continue to purchase this battery. I also had some questions about the batteries and called customer service and they were very helpful.

2221,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased a much more expensive collapsible crate and was really disappointed in the quality when it arrived. After returning it and purchasing this one, I'm ecstatic! This crate is a great size and the included divider makes it so that it will grow with my puppy. He would barely let me put it up and kept getting in while I was putting it together. Each time I put it up or take it down it gets faster, and I LOVE that it came with two handles which makes carrying it even easier. The divider has already been put to good use and is keeping the puppy nice and cozy. I did notice that a toy slid under the divider and he couldn't get to it so I'll have to adjust how I put in the divider next time (this is for overnight visits outside our home, not his primary crate).Overall, I'm thrilled with the quality and ease of use of this crate, especially for the price!!!"
2222,Source Naturals Magnesium Malate 625mg,1/1,5.0,This product is easy to take and easy on the stomach! Good price too. The Malic Acid is supposed to be good for pain as well.
2223,Peter's Woven Grass Play Ball,0/0,5.0,"My bunny loved this! I got her the hut to and she destroyed both of them, but somehow this lasted longer than the bed.She really seemed to enjoy this the most, she liked to roll it in addiction to chewing it up and it lasted about a week before it was completely unraveled and two before she ate it all.. not to bad for the price.She really seemed to love it, I would recommend this! :)"
2224,Tommy Kono TK Knee Bands,1/1,1.0,"I bought TK knee bands very pleased with the first set , they lasted 7 to 8 months of daily heavy use. This last pair were terrible they lasted 5 weeks ! Not happy !"
2225,Vetiver Cologne by Guerlain for men Colognes,1/1,4.0,"(This is a c/p of the review I submitted for another Guerlain Vetiver listing, since this appears to now be the main product listing)Guerlain's take on vetiver is sharp and soapy at first, with characteristic vetiver coming forward as it settles down and dries. On my skin this stuff is good for a relatively subtle whole day of wear.It took some getting used to, especially with regard to the soapy qualities, but now it's a favorite hot weather scent of mine."
2226,Chewable Papaya Enzyme with Chlorophyll,1/1,5.0,"I've been using this product for more than 10 years and it consistently does the job. Thankfully, I don't need it very often, but when I do it never fails. Delcious and easy to take. I highly recommend it."

2228,Playtex Baby The First Sipster Spill-Proof 7 OZ Cup,0/0,5.0,"I like other sippies that have soft spouts, but my youngest daughter loved this one. The spout is hard plastic, so she could gnaw on it when her gums were sore, and the bright colors made it hard to lose. The duel handles made it easy to grip, and it didn't leak, just as it claimed."
2229,Radio Flyer 12S Classic Walker Wagon,0/0,5.0,"My daughter is 14 months and not yet walking so I bought this walker in hopes to get her motivated. I am so glad I did!!! She absolutely loves it! She puts all her stuffed animals in it and pushes it around the house. Also, we take it to the park and she walks all over the place with it and fills it up with sticks and dirt. It is great because it is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. This walker has really gotten her on her feet!Also, it is very safe. There are clickers on the back wheels, therefore, it doesn't move faster than the child can walk.We are so pleased with this walker! It is definitely worth the $!"
2230,"AKC Duck Puppy Toy, Small",0/0,3.0,"My Dog loved it so much, he chewed it up in a week.I just wish it would last longer"
2231,Nature's Bounty Natures Bounty Acidophilus Chewable Wafers Natural Strawberry Flavor,0/1,5.0,Everything was great about this order. These were recommended by a relative and I am now chewing them daily. I like the strawberry flavor.
2232,Nature's Way Alive! Pea Shake,0/0,4.0,"I like this brand, though because it's pea protein, it can have consequences. The flavor of this compared to chocolate is not as good. There is a chemical-like after taste. I am going to try to mix it with vanilla and see how that works."
2233,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,1/1,4.0,"If you don not adjust this and fit it correctly, you dog can get the muzzle leash off, but the neck stays connected so that keeps them from escaping which is great for my little jack Russell mix! Keeps her from pulling and no training needed for her! Worked from the first time."
2234,"Marineland PA0100 Filter Pad, 312-Square-Inch, Bonded",1/1,5.0,"I bought this as an additional media to add to my Aquaclear media baskets and was very happy when I received it. It was a lot thicker than I anticipated, but that is not an issue. I will be using it in my Aquaclear 70 and Aquaclear 50, and love that I can cut it to size for each model. I will be able to get many changes out of this one roll of filter pad."
2235,North States Supergate Extra Wide Gate,0/0,5.0,I recently purchased this gate hoping that it would work better than the wooden ones they have out there and I was so pleased! It was easy to screw into the wall and it doesn't get stuck like some of the other reviews mentioned. GREAT PURCHASE!
2236,Drakkar Noir Eau de Toilette,0/0,5.0,I bought the cologne for my 17yr old and he loves it.When he runs out im sure i will be buying more.
2237,"Learning Resources Dice in Dice, Set of 72",0/0,3.0,Not a ton to say about this. It is a big jar of double dice at a good price. TH build quality is okay. 4 of the dice were broke when i opened the container. This was not a big deal to me since there was 72 in the package. I got this for a drinking game and they work for what i need.
2238,"Duro-Med Posture Corrector, White,",0/0,2.0,"Although the product did what it was supposed to do, it was very uncomfortable. It cut into the arm pits and the Velcro edges were rough. Wearing a T-shirt under it did not help enough to make me want to continue wearing it."
2239,Amazon.com,1/1,5.0,The support hose is every bit worth the money I spent. I love the support it gives my legs and the size is a true fit. I will be making additional purchases. I went to the emergency ward on crutches due to inflammation in one of my legs caused by a vain ruptured. With health insurance my out of pocket expense was $656. The stockings are worth the money. Jobst is the best.
2240,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,2/2,5.0,I have very bad ringing in my left ear and I am a very light sleeper. This has helped so much with both issues. I don't know how I ever slept without it. This has improved my quality of sleep so much when I wake up every morning and hear it I can't help but to smile.
2241,BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer,0/0,5.0,"We ordered this seat for our daughter after she liked the one her cousins had. It is a great size for a little two-year-old learning to sit on the toilet. The front part can get a little messy if they scoot forward after using the bathroom, but the surface is very easy to clean. This is a great little seat."
2242,Walkfit Orthotic Size A,0/0,5.0,"I ordered a pair of these about 5 years ago. I have struggled with foot and knee pain since childhood, had bi-lateral release surgery at age 17 (that's both knees), reconstructive surgery on the right at age 21 from torn acl and meniscus, then spent the next 9 years avoiding all my favorite activities like hiking (hills are killer on the knees), hence you found me sitting on my butt watching info-mercials. I told myself it couldn't hurt any more than it already did. I was 30 years old with the arthritis and the lower body joint pain of a 50 year old. Honestly, it took about 3 months for me to feel a difference, but for the first time in 15 years my knees didn't hurt. I went up a flight of stairs and that sharp, knifing pain in my kneecaps was absent; my ankles didn't hurt. Even the lower back pain was receding. By this time I had 2 very small children and was always running after one or the other, but the constant pain in the background was so debilitating. Now at age 35 I still wear these religiously. When I throw on my flip-flops to go walk around somewhere because I'm too lazy to lace up my tennis shoes or pull on my boots, I pay for it within a couple of hours. The knee pain comes right back, so these definitely don't correct the way your feet naturally are...it's an ongoing usage thing. Maybe for people like me who have had out of shape feet their entire lives, it would take longer than just one week for them to readjust all those tiny bones in your foot. I'm trying to correct the problem in my son's feet now, at age 6, he has over-pronation (his ankles bow inward extremely) and he's always complaining of foot pain when he walks. If they made walkfit for children, I'd order him some; had to find another orthotic for him though. Hopefully it will correct the problem now and he won't be dependent on walkfits for the rest of his life. As to the customer service for walkfit.com? I honestly don't remember what I paid, but I'm pretty sure it was within the normal range. If you're not sure, just order from amazon.com. I hear they're pretty good with the customer service thing. =)"
2243,Nivea for Men Cooling Post Shave Balm Hair Removal Products,0/0,5.0,"Great product. Balms are better than the splashes, mostly because they are easier to apply and because they provide better moisturizing qualities. The scent is pretty decent (somewhat minty), though it can at times have a strong alcohol smell. I shake the bottle before using, and it generally prevents this from occurring."
2244,"Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump, 10-Gallon",0/0,4.0,"This was the first air pump I've used. The most important factor for me was noise, and judging but it's name I figured it would work out. This pump is very quiet but not silent. It has a very mild hum to it but if you put it away from the tank in a cabinet or ever on the floor a few feet away, you can barely hear it. If the bubbles are turned up enough, you can't hear it all. I've noticed that depending on how open or closed the air valve is, the pump will increase in sound slightly. The tighter the valve is closed the louder the pump is. I believe due to back pressure. When it is fully open, the pump is at it's quietest. I have mine in a 10 gal and the full open position is a little too much air pressure for what I wanted. This pump puts out a lot of bubbles, Id say it's more geared for a 20 gal than 10 but turned half way it's perfect for my needs. A slow trickling bubble is what I wanted and you can adjust it to your needs from full bubbled to nearly none. For under $7 you really can't beat it. I guess I got lucky and got a quiet one but if I hadn't purchasing another for $7 wouldn't really put me out much."
2245,Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,"I have uses so many bottle brushes since I have had my baby, and finally found one I like! It us sturdy, so u can get a good grip on it while cleaning. Yes when u take it out of the bottle SOME soap and water shatters, but who cares? I don't see the big deal, just point the bottle down a little. It's not that hard. I'm sure all us moms have dealt with a lot worse. I have had it for 4 months now, and yes the nipple brush rusts a little, but I boil it once a week. I do this with all my bottles to ensure they r clean. It's not hard. All in all I will be telling my friends about it, I just love it!"
2246,Pedifix '4 In 1' Super Soft Toe Cushions,2/2,1.0,"Perhaps it was the way the ad was written, because I thought I would receive 6 of these (2 x 3 pairs). But I only received one pair, which I am certain you can buy for less than the $13.00 I ridiculously paid."
2247,"JW Pet Company Insight Sand Perch Bird Accessory, Small",0/0,5.0,"I bought a few of these perches. Ever since I put them in & outside the cage, my Conure's nails are a bit shorter and he loves using them as scratching posts!!!"
2248,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,2.0,"This Egyption Musk oil smells ok, I wore just a dab to work and it made me and others around me sneeze alot. Also i broke out a little with redness and itching where I applied it. So I do not suggest this to someone who thinks they may want to avoid these issues."
2249,Slumber Pet Thermal Cat Mat,0/0,3.0,"The cat loved it immediately. Unbeknownst to us, the ""insulation"" is a sheet of crinkly plastic. There is very little padding to this which was kinda the point of getting it. We wanted to insulated our cat from not only the cold floor but also the hardness of the floor.Unfortunately, when we moved the mat from the office where she first seen and loved it to where her bed is, she freaked out and my wife almost had to go to the emergency room to get stitches. Our cat likes playing with plastic. But I think the fact that it is concealed between the layers of this mat really threw her off. Looks like a comfy mat but sounds like a pile of plastic bags. I guess I might be freaked out if I was a cat too."
2250,"CaribSea Arag-Alive 20-Pound Special Grade Reef Sand, Bimini Pink",0/0,5.0,I got a great deal. I bought 6 bags and saved $54 over a local pet store and I got it shipped to my door for free. I can't wait to add it to my 90 gallon reef tank.

2255,Finish Jet Dry Rinse Agent,0/1,5.0,"First off as a bachelor, I have never used Jet-Dry in the dishwasher. Where I live has very hard water and if the dishes are not removed immediately from the dishwasher and wiped hard water spots will cover the dishes. I decided to test the Jet-Dry on some crusty, un-rinsed dishes that had been in the sink for two weeks due to being out of town, and leave them in the dishwasher overnight. Normally this would require rinsing/scraping before the dishwasher. I put the dishes in on normal wash filled the dishwasher with Jet-Dry (thanks special lady for informing me that you just keep filling the dispenser till its full and check it periodically. Yes, I had to make a call to learn how to use Jet-Dry!). Washing dishes like this would usually leave some form of caked on crusty stuff, and leaving the dishes overnight would leave heavy hard water spots on the dishes/glasses. Much to my surprise, the dishes were spotless upon removal in the morning! There was no crusty food stuck to the plates or silverware, no spots on anything! I am amazed. I can say, if it can be helped, my dishes will never be washed sans Jet-Dry again."

2260,"Pirate's Booty Veggie, 4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,1.0,"I LOVE Pirate's Booty (the aged white cheddar variety). And recently, I've been trying several varieties of veggie chips, all of which have been pretty good. So when I saw that I could get Pirate's Booty in a veggie variety, I thought, ""Great! Now I can have a super tasty and healthier snack! What could be more perfect?"" and I ordered this 12-pack through subscribe-and-save.I was so excited when it arrived, and immediately broke open a package. It didn't look like I had expected (which was the typical, reddish, greenish, and yellow colors from other brands of veggie chips), and it instead looked like the regular Pirate's Booty puffs covered in a weird greenish powder. It smelled weird, too. ""But hey,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a try. Maybe it tastes good."" So I put one in my mouth. It was so disgusting. It tasted like rancid broccoli. I thought, ""Maybe it's one of those things where you get used to the taste after a couple and then it's good,"" so I tried a few more. No luck. Still gross.I tried giving the rest of my serving to my one-year-old daughter, who also quite likes the regular Pirate's Booty. She ate a couple, and then proceeded to drop the rest on the floor for the dogs to gobble up. I then gave her some Veggie Sticks (also ordered from here, and quite tasty--right in line with what I have come to expect from a veggie chip), and she ate those just fine.When my son came home from kindergarten, I offered him some as a snack. He ate one, and made a face. ""I don't like these, Mommy,"" he said. ""Can I have something else?"" So I gave him some Veggie Sticks, too, which he loves.Last try was my husband. When he came home from work, I asked him to try them. He told me that they tasted like rotten vegetables.The only ones in my house who will eat them are my two dogs, and even they won't eat them if I put them in their dog bowls. The only way they will eat them is if they think they're getting people food, so I have to put them on my daughter's high chair tray and let her toss them on the floor for them to eat.I gave the remaining 11 bags to my son's school's food drive. Hopefully someone else will actually enjoy them."
2261,Rena Air 300 Air Pump,0/0,3.0,"I bought this pump after reading hyped up reviews by others and inflated product specifications from the manufacturer. It does not deliver anywhere near as much air as promised, no matter where I set the control screw. I've had better luck with pumps that cost me less than half what this one did, so I will stick with those in the future."
2262,"Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8"" Screen - Silver",0/0,1.0,This monitor was awful!!! It worked for 3 days and then the screen went blank and that was it. It is not worth the money!!
2263,"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White",0/0,5.0,The changing table came quickly and was packaged properly. It looks beautiful in our nursery and has plenty of space in the drawers/cubbies!
2264,CHAMPION Neoprene Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Hinged Bars,0/0,4.0,"Only problem I have is over use. I've been having some knee pain after twisting my knee. Have used this for plane rides, long meetings where sitting too long. This helps you from putting your leg / knee into a position that will hurt. Really helped improve. When I wear it too long - 6+ hours, the straps sometimes slide down into my knee. Just need to keep tightening, or wear it a little shorter length. Would definitely buy again."
2265,Anthony Logistics for Men Pre-Shave Oil Hair Removal Products,0/0,1.0,"I tried the oil for the first time as Anthony has done away with the pre-shave lotion I previosly used. I use an electric razor and it did help, but my neck broke out from the oil so I returned my unopened bottles. It also had an odor that I was not fond of."
2266,Multipet Plush Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"My dog is an absolute brat when it comes to his toys, except this one. He absolutely adores it. Its the only toy he hasn't ripped into a million pieces until now. I attribute it to the following things:1. Its really plush which makes light and fluffy2. Its the perfect size for him to carry in his mouth3. Its surprisingly tough and doesn't get chewed very easily4. It has a really funny noise which makes all of us laughConclusion"

2269,Dalmatian Dog Bobble Head Bobbing Doll,0/0,5.0,This is a great gift for anyone. Only drawback is that the head does not nod after a strong push. It needs to be Gentle!
2270,KMS California Hair Stay Styling Gel (select option/size),0/0,1.0,I used KMS hair gel for years and it was my favorite product. The recently changed the packaging to a new blue bottle. The gel has the same great hold but now it has a funky smell.
2271,Disposable plastic graduated medicine cups with 1 oz capacity by Dynarex - 100 ea,0/0,5.0,The cups were inexpensive but they were good quality for a disposable item. Perfect for what I needed them for. I would order this product again if needed.
2272,Nailtiques Formula 3,0/0,5.0,"Nailtiques Formula 2 Plus is a fantastic product. watch the size you are ordering - I did not pay attention & it was smaller than I realized. The product seems to go a long way, it drys quickly and has really made a difference in the strength of my nails. I will purchase again once I run out!!"

2275,Dog Toy Pet Stages Cool Teething Stick,0/0,4.0,Cute toy and what I was looking for my baby teething. I read the reviews before buying this so I knew it didn't freeze well. I have soaked it for hours then froze it and only part of it froze. Still a cute toy for small baby dog and good price.
2276,Grafco Pill Counter,1/1,5.0,It was just what I needed because my online pharmacy frequently shorts the users on quantity. Has anybody out there who has shared this experience?
2277,Baby Blue Jeans By Gianni Versace For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.6 Ounces,1/1,2.0,I DO NOT like Baby Blue Jeans by Versace for Men at all...TOO STRONG of a Lemoneey mixed w/ Baby Powder type of smell. (smells like Lemon Pledge u use to clean with).I would NOT purchase this again.The only reason why I did was because I wanted to TRY it out and the Price was good at around $13 bucks on Amazon.I would suggest you PASS on this one.You will not be satisfied....I wasn't anywayIf you don't believe me......try for yourself ! ; )P. S. If you want to try a decent cologne by Versace go with BLUE JEANS....thats a classic and its a decent price on Amazon at around $20 for a 2.5oz bottle.
2278,"Frontier Safe - Steel Safe with Combination Lock and Coin Slot (Blue,Black, Red, Purple)",0/0,2.0,I ordered two of these. One for my daughter and one for my son. When they arrived the combination lock did not turn smoothly and they both had trouble getting the safe to open. We replaced them with the toy safe made by Schylling and they seemed to work much better.
2279,The Stick Travel Stick,0/0,5.0,A great product which arrived promptlyMy daughter loves to use it to massage her sore muscles from ballet and gymnasticsWould recommend

2282,Guidecraft Safari Collection Book Display,0/0,5.0,"This arrived in quick time and was really easy to assemble. It looks lovely and is really sturdy compared to some book displays and cases I saw in stores. The paintwork on the side of the animals is really pretty. I love it in my daughter's room, she is 3 so it makes it easy to choose books from compared to the book case. This would definitely be suitable for both girls and boys - it's not particularly girly"
2283,Xenna Xenna Nonyx Nail Gel,0/0,5.0,"I have used many products, I almost did the laser treatment, but this one worked for me. There are other products too, this one works."

2288,Tweezerman Safety Slide Callus Shaver with Rasp,1/1,2.0,"I was really hoping this would be an answer for me in my ongoing battle against callouses on the soles of my feet. However, I found it sometimes works ""too good"" and ended up with an abrasion which is no fun. But the most frustrating part was trying to change the blade. The directions on the package are printed in extremely small print so you need a magnifying glass but even then its not a huge help because they aren't clear. It says to lay on a flat surface but it does not say which side to put down (face up or face down) or what to do once you lay it down. I'm not a dumb person and usually can figure things out but I couldn't figure this to save myself. Finally emailed the company and they said they'd respond but they never did so I wasn't happy with that. I just found the video online which sort of shows you how to change the blade but the video isn't great either. The womans hands are in the way so once again you can't see and it doesn't say whether to lay product face up or face down. They stress to be careful coz its very sharp and then zip through the directions rather glibly and talk way too fast so I still don't get it and I'm not happy with the product or the instructions or the packaging or the company and I would not recommend it. I have replacement blades which does me no good because its a mystery how to change them. BUMMER (and I don't usually write such critical reviews). NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
2289,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,0/0,3.0,Product worked fine for 4 months - then quit working. There is no product warranty available if purchased online - and the return policy expired 45 days after purchase.
2290,"Dream Zone- Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask, 1ct",0/0,4.0,I really like this sleep mask. The only thing is how hot my eyes get when I have them on. Overall great to block out light and sleep.

2293,"Gillette Venus Breeze Womens Razor, 1 Razor 2 Razor Refill Cartridges",0/0,3.0,"I like not having to add gel or lather to get a smooth shave. The first few times I used the Venus Breeze, I did notice a little dripping/oozing from the shave gel bars. Not after that. But the bottom shave gel bar fell off the razor long before it was 'used up'. And there didn't seem to be any way to make it stick back on. This is my first gel cartridge, so I don't know if this was a fluke or an ongoing problem. The razor still shaves"
2294,Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this for a recent vacation. It is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to open, big enough that would last well onto 2-3 years of age. I originally wanted the blue color, but since amazon did not have it in stock I ordered the gray/red one. Happy with it! Great value for the price."
2295,"Marineland MN606UL Mini-Jet Adjustable Flow Pump 606, 82-153 GPH",0/0,4.0,This is an excellent product! It is just the right size for what we want to do if you have 5 or 10 gallon aquaria and you need to pump water from one to another it is great! It however does not deal well with sand it clogs easily! If you have sand at the bottom of your containers you would need to find a way to avoid the sand getting into your pump.
2296,Acu-Life Massage Sandals Massage Sandals Black/Teal with Velcro M11/W13,0/0,1.0,The sandles did not last long. The pressure point pins started to fall off shortly after I began wearing the sandles. It was a loss for me.
2297,Aquolina Pink Sugar,0/0,4.0,I like the fragrance on my wife. Being sweet it's probably best avoided in humid summer weather as it can become a bit sickly.
2298,Nature's Way B-100 Complex,0/0,5.0,These are the right size and they are easy to swallow as well. I will definitely be buying them again!
2299,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,"My daughter has been sucking her thumb religiously since birth. Now that she's almost 3, we needed to break her of the habit so she may have straight teeth. Our dentist recommended Mavala. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that the product would affect her eating habits. I didn't have to worry. The Mavala broke her of the thumb sucking in about a week. I am still pretty amazed. I thought it would take much longer to break her habit. I didn't notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food."
2300,Grass Gel For Cats - Hairball Remedy - 4 oz,0/0,5.0,"Love this product. Despite many vet visits, diet changes, etc., my poor cuddlebug has suffered for years from constipation and vomiting. I'm pretty sure hairballs are the cause but I have never been able to get her to accept treatment. (That malt stuff in a tube? Yeah, she wouldn't eat it. I tried putting it on her paw like the tube says. She walked right over to the couch and rubbed it off on the suede!) After reading the reviews of this product on Amazon I decided to give it a try. It's been fantastic. We've been using it for a month now and the vomiting has dropped by 80%. There's no more crying in the cat box either. I put a spoonful into her wet food each night and it's all smooth moves."
2301,"OFNA Racing Hex Wrench Set, 1/4 Drive, 1.5-3mm",0/0,4.0,"These work as advertised. They're sturdy, they're a great length for getting into some hard-to-reach spots on my RC cards, and they snap in place nicely in my little 12V impact driver.Holders for the extra 2 bits would have been nice, or some sort of case."
2302,Bigelow Tea (6 Pack),0/0,4.0,Excellent value. Much less cost than in stores if you like Biegelow tea you will like this tea. It is the same product for much less cost

2304,Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food,0/0,5.0,"My lab hit middle age this year just like me and we have both slowed down a bit. Her coat was dull and thinning. I have only had her on this a month and notice a difference. She is a typical lab and will eat anything so that was never an issue. The more I was focusing on my diet, the more I started focusing on hers. Why shouldn't she eat top quality food if I am?"
2305,"Activa Mens Dress Socks Microfiber Moderate Compression 20-30 mm Hg, Pinstripe",1/1,5.0,"I ordered these over a year ago and now I am ordering more. I have swollen toes, feet, ankles and lower legs, a side effect of some medication I have to take. These socks significantly reduce the swelling and discomfort. Compression socks are never easy to put on, but these seem to be the least troublesome to slip on. Get the right size and compression and you can't go wrong. Highly recommended."
2306,Nylabone Rhino Bone Chew Toy,0/0,5.0,"Our two cattle dog pups have chewed on this for 8 months and it's just now starting to break apart. They have chewed through so many other toys so I can attest this is a great product for the right dog. It's durable for a 30lb dog. Those people rating this product as a one didn't read the part that says not good for aggressive chewers. I you have a large dog with powerful jaws, any rubber toy will be toast. Know your dog and know what toys work for them. This is a five star toy for my dogs which are a year old now. If your dog can snap through meat bones then this is probably not a good toy. If your dog is more chewer than chomper then this toy rocks."
2307,"L'Oreal Line Intensifique Liquid Eyeliner, Earthen Rock - .05 fl oz",0/0,5.0,This product and color is the best but has been discontinued by L'oreal. So sad when that happens. Have to look real hard for it but worth it.
2308,Prestige Aneroid Sphygmomanometer with matching Carrying Case,0/0,3.0,"Acreditei que fosse um produto melhor do que o demonstrado na propaganda. Funcionou bem, mas no me agradou. No achei de boa qualidade"
2309,Flexi Leash Accessory Bag-Black,0/0,5.0,"We love this little bag! Anyone, our kids, friends, etc. can take our dogs for a walk and all they need is the dogs and the leash. This little bag has the disposal bags and treats already loaded, and space for a phone and keys on those pocket-free days. No forgetting anything important, no excuses for leaving neighborhood 'gifts'!I have been planning to replace it for a while since it is looking a little worse for the wear, but all zippers, pocket seams and elastic are still functioning fine."
2310,Emporio He,0/0,4.0,"This is the real deal Previously purchase other vendors product and it was not the real deal, The cent would not last,this last a long time even after dancing for some time. Ok to purchase from this vendor."
2311,Spy Voice Scrambler,0/0,5.0,"fun, durable, and exactly what we thought it would be. My daughter loves playing with this. Inexpensive toy that provides hours of entertainment."
2312,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,5.0,"Americolor Soft Gel Paste food colorant works well for making your own custom sanding sugar colors for cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. A few drops in a plastic container with some sugar and a lot of shaking later you will have nicely colored sugar that is not too wet or all clumped together. I use this technique to make custom colored sugars for various cake and cookie decorating needs."
2313,Sally Hansen Lavender Spa Wax Remover Kit For Body,0/0,5.0,"I've used other waxes and they're never quite substantial enough to get my armpit hair. This does the trick. I've been using it for years. Other reviewers have mentioned that it's not water soluble. No. It's not. (I think it improves the pulling power of the wax!) But baby oil on paper towels or cotton balls works great. If it spills on your counter, baby oil or GooGone works."
2314,"Glow Stick Necklaces- Tube of 50 22"" Premium Glow Stick Necklaces Mixed Colors",0/0,1.0,This item was very disappointing. it did not come with connectors and more then half of them did not light up. Would not buy again.
2315,"Comfort Zone with DAP for Dogs Diffuser Refill, 48 Milliliters",0/0,5.0,"I have a high strung 12 year old black lab mutt. Ever since he was a puppy he has had issues with anxiety. He would destroy things, mess in the house, and generally go bananas when we left. I tried training, vests, crates, etc. all to no avail.A week after I started using the DAP I noticed a reduction in anxiety, hyperactivity, and distructive behavior. My dog can relax quicker and easier when we come home. He also doesn't get as amped up during thunderstorms.I was I had found this years ago."
2316,philosophy | the oxygen peel | in-home oxygen peel for all skin types,0/0,5.0,This peel really does a great job on removing dead skin and black heads. I had the peel applied while at the beauty store and just did my first home application. It was an easy 6 step process.1. Mix the gel2. Apply the gel3. Apply the oxygen cream4. Wait 1-3 minutes while the gel and oxygen cream form a foam5. Scrape of the foam (tool is included)6. Clean the residue off your faceFor the week between having the peel done at the store and redoing it at home I noticed that my pores stayed a lot cleaner on my blackhead prone areas and my skin remained blemish free. When I did it my self I also saw the dead skin and grime that the peel was removing after each scrape. So I can see the work the peel does during the process and the effects long after. I'm really happy with this purchase and will be incorporating it into my weekly regimen.
2317,Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Straightener,1/1,1.0,"I bought this iron for my wife in July 2009. She loved it but the iron developed an electrical short where the cord enters the iron. After doing some research my wife told me that 3 years is about the maximum life expectancy for a straightening iron. On June 18, reluctantly, I ordered this same straightening iron as a replacement. This one has shorted out in the same place but after only 4 months! Not impressed! Save your money--buy something else."

2321,Earth Solutions Aromatherapy Scent Inhaler,1/1,5.0,The Lucid Dream Scent Inhaler works like a charm. I had a lucid dream the first night i used it.
2322,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,4.0,"Thanks Amazon!! The item arrived really fast.I will say I am either really smart, really dumb or I got the wrong product. I had the bed setup in like 5 minutes so I am not sure why so many folks are complaining about putting it together, hum.I got the size large so my two 20lb dogs could share it and it seems to be enough room for the both of them. The material seems sturdy. I did notice the base was real wobbly when I was taking it to the outside but it didn't seem to be an issue when one of my dogs jumped on it but time will tell. I just made sure the bolts were tight. I only rated it a 4 because I am not sure of the frame's sturdiness just yet."
2323,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,"My 9 month old Golden chewed up her vellux blanket and her fleece crate pad. Got her the X-Large pet Dreams bed for her crate from Amazon, and she has not even tried to chew it. After 1 month, I give it 5 stars!!!"
2324,"Lavazza Italian Coffee, Premium Drip Coffee - ground, 10 Ounce Can",0/0,1.0,"I find the Lavazza Black and Blue and Gold pre-ground coffee in a can to be consistantly very good coffee - even superior coffee to most American brands. I first tried Lavazza on a visit to northern Italy and will occasionally buy the Lavazza coffee here in the US but not always because of the higher cost.Recently it was on sale 2 for 1 at a local grocer and I picked the Black can and the Red can which I hadn't tried before, but I expected it to be just as good, with some minor flavor differences. However trying to brew it in a drip or stovetop espresso both failed miserably (I reground it to smaller grinds for the stovetop espresso maker). I would not recommend this to anyone. I will try the french press like another reviewer suggested, but this is really the worst tasting coffee you can buy for the money.I'm currently mixing in a little of it with another bean to go through it rather than return it to the store, because I was raving to the clerk at how good Lavazza coffee is when I bought it, I'd be a bit embarrased to return it."
2325,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruity Pasta, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/1,1.0,"As a typical Haribo gummy candy, it's fine. Whatever.But, this is NOT a sour candy. The package says ""extra sour,"" but it's not even regular sour! Perhaps the other reviewers don't like actual sour candy, I have no idea. But this is NOT a sour candy, make no mistake."
2326,Duro-Med Deluxe flexible Sock and Stocking Aid; White,1/1,3.0,"Works well but the terri cloth fabric is already beginning to tear. Product needs to be more durable. Like the size, can carry in luggade when traveling."

2328,Cerama Bryte Ceramic Cooktop Cleaner 28 Oz,0/0,5.0,"This cleaner definitely outperforms any other cooktop cleaner I have used. Also get the microfiber cloth - using the cloth vs paper towels or even non scratching sponge scrubbers gets better results. Be sure to shake the solution before using it. And if you've got a stubborn mess, pour & spread around the solution, let it sit for awhile, then use the dry microfiber cloth to tackle it."
2329,Stash Black Tea Blends (Pack of 6),0/0,5.0,Best orange flavor out there. I tried this 24 years ago and have been hooked since. Try it. You will love it. Have also gifted this and it is always a hit.
2330,"Walk Over Wooden Gate (30-44"" W, 18"" H)",0/0,4.0,For the price of $2.44 I thought this was a great deal! Went to petco and pet supplies plus and the cheapest price was $36.99. For the quality its good it does what it suppose to do.

2332,Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 16 beans JR Mushrooms brand,10/14,1.0,"When so many reviews are over-the-top about vanilla beans... doesn't it make you question the integrity of the reviews? To be frank, they are all from one source"
2333,8in1 eCotrition Large House - Guinea Pig/Rabbit,0/0,4.0,"I give this product 4 stars out of 5 because it serves it's purpose well, but the hay-top parts weren't holding together as well as i think they could have. I got the larger one which, BTW, is not pictured and is HUGE!! If you have a chinchilla, larger rabbit, or anything else I think you'll find this suitable. I rescued some squirrels and they absolutely love hiding in this. But they don't really bite on it or anything, even though they can.. Great product, though."
2334,Rescue Remedy (20ml vial),0/0,4.0,I think this product has improved my anxiety some. I usually put it in a 1/2 glass of water and just sit back and relax. I would recommend it to others. It sure can't hurt.
2335,Sesame Oil Toasted/Unrefined (Organic) - 8.5 oz - Liquid,1/1,5.0,"Full of flavor, delicious and important part of Asian cooking. You need a half a tsp and you really get the flavor so you use less oil. I wish they made a spicy version. Hard to get this in the health food stores, I mostly see the non-organic kind. Thank you Amazon for having it on hand."
2336,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"This always tastes amazing! Be warned though you tend to get gassy with this product, but who cares, its healthier than most and tastes amazing!!!"
2337,Immobilizer Support Collar,0/1,2.0,"On the one hand, I'm well aware that I get what I pay for. On the other hand, I was fairly certain that the low price on this collar was/is an indication that it didn't have much to offer. Therefore, my bad. I should have (and maybe will ) shell out lots more $$ for a collar that is comfortable enough to wear, even when sleeping."
2338,Denman Classic Styling Brush,1/1,5.0,"I hardly ever leave reviews, but this brush is so exceptional that I have to spread the word. Whether I brush dry or wet it makes my course and semi-dry hair bouncy and shiny. I highly recommend brushing upside down with this for great volume. The detangling is also excellent. GET IT."
2339,"Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff Flour, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",2/5,1.0,"Teff flour is an amazing ancient grain, high in protein and nutrients. I purchased Bob' teff and made injura. It tasted delicous, so I ate three of them. Shortly after consuming them, I went for a long run in the heat and became ill. I thought it was the heat. A few hours later I was violently throwing up, like food poisoning and blaming it on using too much coconut oil. It was a year before I made bread with it again. I ate a small slice. Two hours later I was violently throwing up. Hmmm, connection? I have no known allergies other than to neosporin and nickel, so it seems ridiculous I would have problems with a grain, especially one so innocuously tiny! Not wanting to give up easily, I decided to eat a pinch, literally, of teff flour. The amount was so small, I thought it would only make me a tad nauseous. Big mistake. A few hours later I had another violent rejection episode. I googled for information but only found one woman who experienced a food poisoning type response to teff, but her post was five years old, so I didn't respond with questions. I emailed a small company that distributes teff and a kind woman said some people's bodies reject teff. Wow, reject is too nice a word for what happens to me. I apologize for such a disgusting post, but it is important for people to know that some bodies do reject (violently) this flour. It is such an ancient grain, rejection seems almost impossible. It is not."
2340,World-Famous DOUX Hand-Crafted Pure Shea Butter enriched French Soap 250g (oval),0/0,5.0,"When I was in Provence France, I bought several bars of mimosa soap at a small public market. After returning home and using the soap, I knew I had to find a source for this wonderful soap! I checked several sites on-line, but only Doux shea butter soaps looked like the bars I had purchased on that wonderful summer day... When I received the soap, I could not believe it was exactly like my French soap! The smell, the shape of the bar, the creamy lather. If you can't take a trip to France for soap, this site is the next best thing!"
2341,Nivea Visage Q10 Plus Anti Wrinkle Night Cream 50ml,4/4,1.0,"Please be aware this is a false advertisement. I paid extra dollars for this cream because it is advertised as ""product of Germany"". I ordered it a month ago. It finally arrived today. Guess what, the one I received looks different from the bottle shown here, and it's made in Thailand!! Cheaters, get your false advertisement of this site!!"
2342,"Jerdon JSC5 9-Inch Portable Suction Shower Mirror with 5x Magnification and Clear Vinyl Travel Case, Chrome and Acrylic Finish",0/0,1.0,"One look into this 5X magnification bathroom mirror told me how poor its quality is. The wavy image of my face looking back reminded me of a funhouse mirror. Price-wise, this is a very cheap mirror, especially for its large size, but the cheapness of its glass makes it a very poor purchase, indeed."
2343,BareMinerals Brushes,0/0,5.0,"I love this brush! I use it for my bare minerals foundation, this is now the only brush that I use. It is very soft, and it gets the makeup on evenly."
2344,Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Dry Dog Food,0/0,4.0,I love this dog food and how they are natural... we switched to this after learning about all of the harmful ingredients in the dog foods now. Propelyene Glycol (only to name one major hazard) All ingredients are earth made.
2345,BD Ultra-Fine Ii 30 Gauge Lancets,2/2,5.0,"The BD ultra-fine lancets are the best lancets out there! I have been a type 1 diabetic for 19 years and have tried lots of lancets and lancet devices. I've used the freebies that come with glucose meters, I've bought various brands (including store brands) of lancets and none compare. As the other reviewer stated, it is nice that the cap can go back on after use. I love these so much that I don't even use a lancet device to prick my finger. I just poke the needle in my finger. I was bruising from the devices and doing it on my own allows me to control the amount of pressure used. I continue to use the 30 gauge because they are great and I don't want to spend the extra $$ on the 33 gauge. I highly recommend these! I also love that Amazon sells them (cheaper too!) because I've been having a hard time finding them at Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc."
2346,"E-Flite JST Male Connector with Lead, 20 Gauge (2)",0/0,5.0,"I bought these to use with my RC helicopters and batteries. They are really simple to solder on to existing wire, you might want some shrink tube to cover the joint afterwards.I noticed on one vehicle they were getting pretty warm. I did some research and found that these aren't good past 6-10A, depending on who you listen to. So if you have something small that doesn't use a lot of power, these are great. Otherwise, you will want to go for one of the larger connectors that can handle more amps."
2347,"Instinct Grain-Free Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal Formula, 25.3-Pound Package",0/0,5.0,"This is a great product. I've been feeding this for ~6 months and the grain free formulation seems to have really helped my dog's skin allergies. I have a small dog, a papillon, and this kibble is small enough that she has no problem eating it. This is also an excellent price. When purchased in smaller bags at my local pet store it is >$4/lb vs. $2.20/lb from Amazon. Highly recommend."
2348,The Wet Brush,0/0,4.0,"Tried this for kids with waist length, thick and curly hair. Works best with wet hair with conditioner in it. But seems to penetrate only the top layer of the hair. Would be good for a child who gets really upset about having hair brushed as it gets the job done without pain but it WILL take longer."
2349,eb5 Age Spot Formula (6.7 Ounces),0/0,5.0,I have been using eb5 Age spot Formula for over 10 years. It is a great moisturizer and it does fade age spots over time. In the past I purchased it at J C Penney but they no longer carry it. I was happy to find it on Amazon.When I find a good product that works I like to stick with it.
2350,Melissa & Doug T-Rex Dinosaur Plush,1/1,5.0,"I have two girls so I am not as knowledgeable about boy stuff. But I knew my soon-to-be 5 year-old nephew loved dinosaurs. I also am a big fan of Melissa & Doug products so I purchased this for his birthday gift. It was a huge hit. I am officially the coolest Aunt for buying him this T-rex doll. He loved it so much that he took a bath with it (luckily, it stood outside the tub). It measures 36"" high so to a small child, it is almost life-like. He and his brothers love to wrestle with it and drag it around and it has maintained its shape. I would expect nothing less from a M&D product. So, if you know someone who loves dinosaurs, I would highly recommend this stuffed toy."
2351,The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),0/0,5.0,"Although it wasn't cheap, this was one of the best investments....my cat goes nuts for this bundle of feathers. There is a warning on the packaging that you need to hide the toy when not in use--I understand why. Cats will continue to chew on the feathers as if it is really their prey."
2352,Short Sexy Hair Short & Sexy Gel Hard Up (select option/size),0/1,3.0,"I bought this gel based on the large amount of positive reviews! Huge mistake. At 25+ dollars, that's about 20 bucks more than I'd be willing to spend on it again! Going back to my Axe hair gel until I find something else worth trying!"
2353,PolySorb Cross Trainer - Size Womens 5/6,0/0,5.0,"I am overweight, with small, sensitive, feet. Always looking for a better insole. These are the best I have found. Fit well without trimming, dont take up a lot of room, very soft and comfortable. My workouts last longer now."
2354,Seachem MultiTest Ammonia Test Kit,1/1,5.0,"This is a must-have complement to an all-in-one kit, such as API's master test kit. Much easier to use than it may first appear-- the most challenging part is handling the sensors, which tend to stick to the metal forceps (static-- wetting the forceps helps). The free ammonia assay is as simple as pipetting 1 mL of sample into a well (label the dish with a permanent Sharpie) and dropping in a sensor. Total ammonia involves one additional step before adding the sensor (add the total ammonia reagent).A properly controlled assay for free and total ammonia requires at least four wells, since you want to control for your conditioned tap water (or whatever source you use). Since each run takes at least 15 minutes, you might as well use wells 5-6 for additional tests (the positive total ammonia control and perhaps a straight/unconditioned tap water test).Once finished, get a small bowl/cup full of clean water and drop the sensors in to rinse them. Then, pick them out and put them back in the container to dry, and they should return to their original yellow color overnight, even if you close the container lid.A few other tips:1. Keep a cup/bowl of clean water close by to rinse your forceps.2. The sensors can be tricky to handle, so place them by the side of the well(s) and use a wooden toothpick to push them in; this ensures the reactions start at essentially the same time.3. Take a picture with the scale, all on a white background with homogeneous lighting. You can then use Image J or Photoshop/similar program to semi-quantitate values, rather than eyeballing them.4. Get a pair of quality forceps. Wiha has many offerings-- makes a huge difference in handling the sensors."
2355,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,1/1,1.0,"First and foremost, the product arrived later than expected, despite being an Amazon Prime product and 2-day shipping being the selected shipping method. However, it didn't really matter since I didn't need to use it right away.When I did undo the Amazon packaging to get to the Frontline Plus box, I noticed that the box seemed partially open. Again, I figured the box was a little faulty and put it in the cabinet until my cat's next dosage time.When I finally get around to opening it entirely, the 1st dose's individual packaging was partially open. Then I noticed the tube itself was empty! I looked at the other ones and sure enough, 2 more were empty and the remaining 3 looked very low...as in maybe 1/8 of the tube had any liquid at all!This product is a sham. Either that or quality control is some of the worst ever. I paid $60 for 6 months' worth of flea medication and I get maybe the equivalent of ONE full tube's worth of medication.Not to mention that since this is a potentially hazardous liquid, returns are not accepted. What a waste of money!"
2356,NARS Duo Eyeshadow,0/0,1.0,"I love NARS eyeshadows, however I stumbled upon some mistakes while shopping this post. Several of the images shown for the eyeshadows are not the correct ones! For example- the pictured duo for ""Heaven"" is not the Heaven duo. The description was correct, but the image was not. Just be careful that you are actually buying what is pictured. I suggest doing a google comparison just to make sure the duo you want is the one you're purchasing.I will try to leave a comment with the retailer."
2357,"Ultimate Nutrition Muscle Juice, 10.45 lb",0/0,3.0,"I am a world class masters javelin thrower. At 60 I am in extraordinary shape. 6'3"" and 230 lbs at 12% body fat. I have used muscle juice many times before this latest adventure. I ordered the banana flavered muscle mass. I have a shaker bottle that I mix the product in with milk. I have yet to get all the muscle juice mixed up no matter how much I dilute it. It is clumpy and foams up really bad making it hard to swallow. In the past I have always used chocolate. No problems. I will never use the banana again. Still has a great taste but is too much trouble to fool with. Have to put it in a blender to get it to completely mixed."
2358,"Traditional Medicinals - Mothers Milk Herb Teas, 16 bag",0/0,3.0,This tea works right away. I was pumping 2.5 oz each time and I drank two cups of this tea when I recieved it and the next day I pumped 3.5 and I drank one cup that day and the following day I pumped 4oz.What I didn't like about this tea is the taste its very aromatic and not my favortie tea even with honey its a little funky but not horrible I can get used to it. I also get some gas pain right after I drink it but thats a minor side effect considering the fact I get alot more milk.I would recommend anyone with supply issues to try this tea at least a box
2359,PediFix Arch Bandage,1/1,5.0,These arch bandages help my Plantar fasciitis a great deal. If you are suffering from heal pain TRY THESE. They really helped me and I was at a point where I was considering getting injections for the pain.
2360,Dingo Mini Bones,0/0,5.0,"My dog is a very picky eater - she will not touch most of the dog foods, including some of the treats. We always try new stuff to find something that will fit her preference. DINGO mini bones was just the right choice! She loves the taste, which shows through how quickly she eats the treats. We give her 2 a day, which I think is the perfect amount.Overall, great product!"
2361,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"I am always on the lookout for astonishing nail color. I do not have pretty hands. I have a lot of red in my skin and dark, bright polishes seem to emphasize this. I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle, but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result. Who has time for that? Two coats of Delicacy covers well; three is better followed by Essie topcoat. My nails look neat, finished and not bare but they don't scream ""I've been polished"" either. The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance. It's a perfect shade for me."
2362,AquaClear Impeller Assembly for Power Filter,0/0,1.0,"I bought the AquaClear 50g filter for my tank because reviews said it was one of the quietest. However, after a year, the impeller began to grind and rattle, so I bought this replacement one in hopes of stopping the noise. Unfortunately, I will never know if a new impeller would have solved the problem. The first one I received came in a smashed box and had two blades cracked off. So, I returned it for a replacement, and received another defective impeller (no blades cracked off, but it had come loose from the plastic box during shipping and bounced around, causing wear and tear, and when placed in my filter, was exponentially louder than it had ever been) due to improper packaging. So, I returned THAT one for a replacement, and the third impeller had one blade cracked off. It's not worth it to keep asking for replacements if they won't improve the packaging. These impellers are delicate and the littlest chip will cause the impeller to rattle in the filter. That said, I do not recommend buying this impeller online. If you can find another place that packages it properly, then go for it. But not Amazon."

2364,Triple Action Flea and Tick Shampoo - 12 oz,0/0,5.0,The triple action flea and tick shampoo I purchased from Amazon is fantastic. I've been using it on my dogs and cats for years after I was first introduced to this product by an outstanding vet that takes care of our cats and dogs. There is honestly nothing better on the market and it doesn't burn their eyes !!! Great Stuff !!!
2365,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Alphabet Stamp Set,2/2,5.0,These stamps are nice but smaller than I thought they would be. I put them in a different container because they are too hard to get in and out of this box.
2366,"Coffee-Mate French Vanilla, Sugar-Free Powdered Coffee Creamer, 10.2-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"Got hooked on Vanilla coffee via WaWa, but can't get to WaWa everyday... very good flavor for sugar free creamer (powder)..."
2367,UNIVERSAL BATTERY D5326/D5926 Super Heavy-Duty Battery Value Box (9V 12-pk),0/0,1.0,7 out of 12 contained little or no charge. We will see how the second box I ordered is but it doesn't look promising. Extremely disappointed.
2368,Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,1/1,1.0,"The good part about this item is that it's cheap, the bad is that it is junk. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is just a plastic sheet that you are supposed to punch holes in yourself and fasten to your railing any which way you can. After struggling with this thing for about 20 minutes, I was not confident my crafty and relentless little one wouldn't just tear it up and slip through. Highly not recommended. I ended up getting a sheet of white plastic garden lattice from the local Mega-Lo-Mart, cut it to fit, and fastened with zip ties. It looks OK, and more importantly there is no way she's busting through that without X-Men powers."
2369,"The First Years 4 Pack Take And Toss Spill Proof Cups, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",3/3,1.0,$15 for four cups is an awfully steep price. I misunderstood the four pack thinking it meant four packs of four cups (16 cups total). I paid $14.99 for four cups. If you go to Target these cups are under a dollar per cup. Not happy at all with the price of this purchase.
2370,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"I am always on the lookout for astonishing nail color. I do not have pretty hands.

2371,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,3.0,"The soap is good for cleaning. It is a mild product, good for cleaning around the home that has children or pets. The smell is ok. It is not overpowering, which is good because the almond smells a bit gross. At first I found the smell pleasant but my Hubby said it smells (sorry for this description) like vomit. After he said that, I kinda agreed. It does have that hint of musty, putrid smell. I really like the cleaning aspects of the soap so I might try a different scent."
2372,"PowerBar Performance The Original Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars",0/0,2.0,"These bars were tasty but they were also 'sticky'. It was sometimes difficult to get the wrapper off, and when I could get it off they would stick to my fingers"

2374,Kyjen Oakley the Octopus Junior Plush Pet Toy,1/2,2.0,"I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, who is 6 pounds. It lasted a week before the poor little guy started falling appart, exposing the threads and stuffing. NOT SAFE TO BE PLAYED WITH UNSUPPERVISED. Your puppy/ dog will choke on the stuffing & can even get to & eat the squeaker! she absolutely adored this toy but it fell apart way too quickly & no, she wasn't tearing it up. was heartbroken after I had to take it away."
2375,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"We've owned this kitty litter box for quite a few months and so far we love it. We have two cats and this is our only litter box. Previously we had the Budha Dome (sp?), but I didn't like going through so many plastic liners (the cats just tear them up- so wasteful). It's super easy to use and we've had no problems with litter spilling out the sides when rolling it. Definitely makes cleanup a breeze. We make a point to clean it out thoroughly every month or so because sometimes litter gets stuck around the grate, but we're seeing less and less of that as time goes by.For those who say they get a lot of litter stuck on the bottom- we had that problem too, but found a super easy solution that works great. When it's fully rolled over, smack the corners with the palm of your hand pretty hard as though it's got something stuck that you're trying to get to fall. It does a great job of dislodging the pieces that get stuck on the bottom and I haven't had to scoop out litter since figuring that out.You'll want to make sure you're rolling this frequently or you'll end up having to scrape the stuff out by hand which is not something I enjoy doing. Plus, if you don't roll it every day or every other day (and depending on the number of cats using the box) you could end up in a situation where you can't pull the drawer out because it's overflowing, which we'd had happen and it's just not a pretty thing to deal with.Assembly was a breeze- just follow the directions. As for litter- we use the Petco refillable litter and haven't had any issues with it yet."

2381,Thurn And Taxis,1/2,4.0,"Thurn and Taxis is the latest in my journey into eurogames that started with settlers. Starting with the packaging and components this game comes in a standard box but there is more than enough room inside to organize all of the components in a way that makes sense. The components are all of high quality with the only qualm being that the game uses the smaller card size(similar to ticket to ride). The game itself is well balanced and scales well from 2 to 4 players, very nice for when you don't have a large group, and can be played in an hour. While it may not have the player interaction of a settlers or ticket to ride there is stull plenty of fun to be had competing to get the bonus tiles first. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy the eurogame style and are looking for something a little quicker or for a good game for 2 players, plus the price is a great value for what you get."
2382,Source Naturals Life Force Multiple Tablets,0/0,5.0,These were in top ten of vitimins of many list I found online and to get a 3 month supply for such a great price is just win...win These pills are not coated so they breakdown easier in the body if you can't handle the smell they give off then its best you switch to the caps instead of these tablets. I highly recommend these I feel so much better after the first bottle has been finished.

I find the feeder to be a well made and well designed product (and isn't it nice to find a quality product which is made in the USA ).I relied on the manufacturer's video during assembly because I tend to respond better to a visual guide. Assembly took some concentration, but everything came together fairly easily, and I was relieved to find that the final adjustments I had to make for my cat's particular brand of dry food were not difficult. ( I did fine tune my initial settings after about two weeks).I bought this particular model because of the many positive and helpful reviews which I found here on Amazon...they convinced me that spending a bit more than I had initially planned would get me a better product...and it did."

2390,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,4.0,"This scratching post was just what we were looking for. It is a good size, tall enough for my long cat to stretch out on. It is also sturdy and well made, and stays put while he is going to town on it. Additionally, the design is more sleek and modern than some other cat posts out there, which allows it to blend in a bit better (it is still a cat post...) with the rest of our furniture. My cat, who previously had been using my chair arm as a scratching post, now happily uses this, which makes me happy to not have destroyed furniture. It's a win win."
2391,Joop! Nightflight Eau de Toilette for Men by Joop!,0/0,4.0,"Nightflight is probably the fragrance that I'm complimented on most. When I was first introduced to this follow-up fragrance from the original Joop! I was quite amazed at how different the tone of it was. It has a vibrant, fresh, out-of-the-shower sort of appeal reminiscent of your favorite bath soap. It's masculine yet smooth, and bold enough to use only a hint. I find it suitable for use morning, afternoon or evening."

I am immediately ordering another one so that i can keep this one in the freezer and have the other one ready to pop into the microwave. I would give it 10 stars if i could. ahhhh the relief.
2395,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"I had run out of this tea and decided to try another brand. Wish I hadn't. This one has much more ginger root in each bag, resulting in a stronger flavor (or a bigger cup of tea). I could use one bag to steep about 8-10oz, two bags for a whole pot. The only thing to take note of is that the packaging has been minimized. The bags are not individually wrapped and don't have a string and tag attached. I don't mind since herbal teas can usually sit in a cup without tasting stewed unlike actual tea leaves."

But when these Ethical Sponge Soccer Balls arrived from Amazon, they jumped all over them--literally. Excellent play value. You may get tired of going after the balls under the buffet and the bed, but never fear. Once you are sure the blue and pink ones are lost for good and get out the green and yellow ones, the original ones will reappear in one of your shoes."

2398,Tartar Scraper - Double End,0/0,1.0,"I bought this tool with hopes that I would be able to successfully use it on at least one of my dogs. They are complete opposite sizes, one small and one very large. Both have a lot of dental tartar and build up. They are well behaved and sit very still for me to to things like this to them so that is not an issue.The first thing that I noticed when I removed it from the packaging was how sharp each end was. If your hand slips at all, this could potentially be very dangerous in your dog's mouth. Still, I carefully tried it on each of my canines but it made no difference. It was not able to chip off any of the plaque or remove any tartar and I was afraid to put too much force into it as I didn't want to damage their gums in the process.Personally, I would not recommend this tool to anyone else."

2402,"King Ghidorah 9"" Action Figure (Japan Godzilla Import)",0/0,4.0,"If you are shopping for a well-made King Ghidorah toy, you will be very happy with this. Read other reviews and you'll see many happy customers. I count myself among them.If you are collecting the 2005 series of Godzilla figures made by Bandai, be warned. This toy is not from that series. It appears to be made in 1998. While it is the same size as the 2005 series, the quality is not as high. Overall I'm very happy with this King Ghidorah figure. But if you are a collector looking for the much higher quality 2005 series, as I was, you should look elsewhere. This 1998 version looks great from a few feet away, but lacks many of the fine details and careful construction of the 2005 version. (The tail doesn't swivel, the heads don't swivel, some gold paint is missing near the joints, etc.) The 2005 figures are really extraordinary. This 1998 King Ghidorah is very very nice, but not extraordinary.With that said, Ghidorah looks absolutely awesome standing next to my other Godzilla action figures from the 2005 series (Godzilla, Destroyah, Gigan). I am very happy with it, and I think any Godzilla fan will also be satisfied. Serious, collectors may be looking for something different."

2404,Paul Mitchell The Conditioner (select option/size),3/4,2.0,"Please do not waste your money on Paul Mitchell if it's not from a salon. I bought this and realized quickly it is old! VERY OLD!!! It smells so bad. I have used this conditioner in the past (bought from a salon) and it smelled great! This stuff smells awful. It still works well, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but it does smell. I then thought to look at the bottom of the bottle. I believe it expired in September 2011. I bought it in October 2012. Need I say more?"
2405,"Flying Fox Bat Cuddlekin 12"" by Wild Republic",0/0,5.0,"I'm a bat aficionado who worked with fox bats while interning at a reptile zoo in high school. I'm now in college and decided to get this little guy as a snuggle buddy while slaving away over physics psets.PROS:This bat has large wings, big black eyes and realistic fur and markings. The fur on his body is smooth and not immensely soft, but this is made up for by very soft wings and a large, furry muzzle. In my opinion, he was stuffed perfectly; not bursting at the seams but having substance to him none the less.From an educational perspective, this bat is a great specimen to use in introducing young children to the wonders of bats. He's not ugly or scary in any way (whereas other stuffed bats, such as Wild Republic's vampire bats, look realistic and therefore might be less likable to people who don't already appreciate bats). He has a face like a dog's or bear's, which children can latch on to and identify with.Overall, I think Wild Republic did a good job representing this animal in stuffed form, great for educational and personal uses alike!CON:I purchased him at $18.09 after having had him in my cart for two weeks and one day after purchase he dropped in price to $11.43. In my opinion, that was in poor taste of the seller although it may have just been bad luck on my part."
2406,Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture Daily Treatment (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"After years and years of purchasing expensive products at the salon and nothing making my hair GREAT, I decided to try something without a salon price. After just 6 weeks of using this conditioner, my stylist wanted to know what I had switched to as my hair was healthier than it has ever been. She was quite surprised when I told her Paul Mitchell. It's a heavy conditioner and that may not be great for oily hair. For me it's perfect. I will be a life long customer."

2413,Majestic Pet- Super Value Pet Bed - Large,0/0,3.0,"The item arrived quickly and intact, it's more like an oversized couch cushion than a standard dog bed. It's pretty firm and overfilled so don't expect a lot of give until after a lot of use. My dog is on the fence about it currently...he likes couch cushions so this is up his alley but it's almost too firm for him to really get it into that sweet spot he likes. Time will tell...just don't buy based off the picture given...the cushion is much more firmer and thicker than seen in the image."
2414,"Conair HH320LR Pro Styler 1875-Watt Bonnet Dryer, White",2/2,3.0,"I use it for conditioning treatments and very been happy with it for that so far. I took away one star because of how loud it is. Another, con is that since it came with no instructions on how to lower the bonnet, I find myself sitting on pillows to raise myself up to reach the heat."
2415,Portfolio Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"I'm 25 years old and Perry Ellis Portfolio has been my cologne of choice for about 8 years now. I first purchased it while on vacation at a fragrance store, and since then have been hooked. The price on amazon is so much better than the $55 I payed for my first container of it. The scent is not strong or overbearing. It's not harsh, fruity or country smelling, yet it still lasts all day for me and is quite noticeable. It's got a lighter, smooth, sexy, almost sweet smell to it. My wife absolutely loves it on me and refuses to let me wear anything else. You know you've found something good when random strangers stop you to ask what you're wearing so they can buy it for their husbands/boyfriends! I really like this cologne and will keep wearing it as long as PE sells it."
2416,Yeah Baby 1oz Spray Cologne,0/0,1.0,cuz it smells like old lady. nothing like juicy. a little disappointed. it was a blind buy so i knew it would be a hit or miss and it was a miss for me.
2417,Aloha Tiare Perfume by Comptoir Sud Pacifique for women Personal Fragrances,0/1,1.0,I have liked their other scents and bought this without first sniffing it.

2418,Reagan with Blonde Hair and Blue Eyes,0/0,5.0,"I purchased Reagan from Amazon and she is a beautiful little doll. My granddaughters just adore her and she is just the right size for little hands. I have a 1 1/2 yr. old and a 3 1/2 yr. old and they just love holding her. Amazon is a great place to do business with, they are very fast at getting the orders filled and sent to your door."

2420,Webkinz Chihuahua,0/0,5.0,"I have owned many, many webkinz in my day, but in my opinion this one is the cutest, I mean come on look at those cute big eyes. When I had my chihuahua on webkinz I named him Charlie. But enough about me and now to the product. These stuffed animals in my past experience are extremely durable and lovable. These stuffed animals just refused to get destroyed. They are also insanely soft, and fun to pet. (Don't Judge!!) But this amazing little stuffed animal is so much more than just your average stuffed animal. Around it's front paw you will find a code tag that will allow you to turn this into a virtual pet. You redeem your webkinz on [...]. Once you've redeemed the code you can adopt the pet and print off it's birth certificate which is unique and cool. Now that your pet has been adopted you can decorate the room just the way you want, and when you run out of money (Kinzcash) you can hit the arcade were you can play a ton of insanely fun games. Webkinz are not high maintenance like some other virtual pets. These Webkinz rock!!!!!(look out for cheap imitators) Overall this product is a no brainer buy, especially at this price."

We were using a bath ""chair/sling"" type thing and I always felt that my daughter was going to slip out of it and into the tub so I was constantly readjusting her. And forget my husband trying to bath her...that was just not going to happen. I love this tub and so does my daughter. She loves that she can sit up and not slip and slide around. Her toys all stay within her reach and in front of her. I love that it is filled with beads instead of an air filled tub. I have never had problems with mildew or any strange smells. We rinse it off with the shower nozzle after her bath and hang it from the shower curtain rod to dry. It is always dry by the next day. It was definitely worth the price!"

2427,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"Our turbo scratcher gets more than daily use in this multi-cat home-Turbo Scratcher has been a fixture here for more than 7 years and is the most-used cat toy we own. As cats love novelty and were bored with the single ball that comes in the track, I added 2 balls of the same diameter and differing weights-ours contains the original ball, a golf ball, and a sturdy lightweight plastic ball (clear ones with spinners are great for this). Using 3 balls of differing weights and premium catnip makes Turbo Scratcher irresistible. When kitties paw at any ball in the track, that ball sets the others in motion-which send the others in opposite directions moving at different speeds according to their weights. Action continues for well over a minute-cats stay fascinated and keep playing! Add a couple tablespoons premium catnip at least twice a week-or add a couple teaspoons weekly. My cats have many toys-Turbo Scratcher gets the most use. With frequent use the cardboard insert breaks down over time-I buy the refill packs and replace them once or twice a year. Inserts can be recycled and repurposed-using a bread knife and cutting board, reduce the catnip infused cardboard down to 1.5 inch cubes-insert catnip and cubes deep into missing-mate socks-tie a single knot in the center-voila! Instant toss and fetch kitty toy!"

2429,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,"We got this walker for my daughter last year at Christmas when she was just 6 months old. She has played with this toy throughout the entire year. When we first got it, she couldn't stand but the front part of the walker comes off so she could play with everything on the floor. When she started pulling herself up to stand, she would balance on this walker and pretty soon she was pushing it around the house, stopping to play with the colorful toys on the front. Now that she is 16 months old and running everywhere, she still likes pushing this around and it still entertains her. Excellent buy for the money. It is very durable and sturdy. Would buy again!"

This hand cream doesn't have a strong fragrance smell but like the herb. It feels oily at the beginning but it fades away after 2-3 minutes, and you will never feel dry until you wash it away. And it's easy to wash off. Once I had burnt in my hand, but the scar is hardly seen after about a month using this hand cream.The only issue I have is this hand cream is a little thin, and maybe not thick for winter."
2431,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,5.0,"It's lightweight and the suction attachment sticks really well to the wall, whether its tile or glass. The squeegee is somewhat flexible allowing for excellent ability to remove the water. We had another squeegee before this one and now we realize how bad it was b/c it wouldn't squeegee well and wouldn't stay on the wall well either. We'll never go back now :)"

2433,"Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer, 4-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,"After finding the Aveeno scrub I mentioned (in another review) how it can dry out your skin without some kind of face moisturizer. Well, I looked into the same brand (Aveeno) and tried out this product. Within days my the skin on my cheeks felt like a babies butt! With both the Aveeno scrub and this lotion my skin (on my face) has been very healthy and soft. I recommend this product to those with very sensitive skin because it doesn't have all the extra ingredients that some products such as proactive or neutrogena has. It is just a very simple basic face lotion that makes your skin soft and healthy. So if you have sensitive, dry skin this is definitely worth trying."
2434,Doc Johnson Anal Plug,0/0,4.0,I assume this product was scientifically designed. If not then I would suggest increasing the length of the stem by 1/4 to 1/2 inch so the sphincter muscle could more easily secure the seal around the bulb end.
2435,Revlon ColorStay Overtime Liquid Lipcolor,1/1,5.0,"This is a very flattering color and I wear it daily, although I usually do not use the clear gloss over the top. I always remove it at night along with my other makeup (it's so yucky to be too tired to do this before bed and to wake up with glop on your face). It stays perfect all day and doesn't come off when you kiss people or eat. Can easily be removed either with Neutrogena eye makeup remover or CVS drugstore's eye makeup remover that is less expensive than the Neutrogena brand. I hope they never discontinue this color, which is similar to Fawn that I believe may be discontinued."

I live alone and find it difficult to cook for myself. Knorr/Lipton makes numerous flavors of these &#34;side dishes&#34; that are so easy to prepare. Just pour dry contents of pouch into 2 quart round bowl, add 2 1/4 cups water and 2 tablespoons salad oil, microwave on high 12-13 minutes and that's it! I enjoy these a couple of times each week and have a nice variety from which to select. Because the contents are dry the product is easy to store and they last a long time."

2439,"SE Podiatrist Toenail Cutter * Large * 5.5"" Long",2/2,1.0,"This is a cheaply made ripoff of otherwise great toenail clipper. Pakistani made, advertised as 'surgical steel', has been filed by hand with visible defects on every surface. It is so dull, it does not cut toenails at all, but only tears them, presuming that one has enough strength in the hand to do it. Even though return postage most likely equals the value of the apparatus, I return it promptly as a matter of principle. Folks, do not be fooled. This tool is a ripoff. I wish there would be a minus 3 (-3) star rating."
2440,Gumballs Really!! Cherry (2 Pounds),0/0,2.0,"I have no problems with the seller or the shipping, but I really didn't expect these things to taste this awful. They aren't inedible, but what I get out of most gumball machines tastes far better- these have a definite rubber taste, a weird sweetness (not real sweet, just... chemically sweet I guess? it's weird) I am hoping this odd flavor isn't from sitting in a warehouse for years on end.If it seems like a cut an paste review, that's because it is. all 3 products (three flavors of gumballs) were identical."
2441,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,4.0,"I've had this bed for about 2 weeks now, and as I write this review, my 2 great danes are squished up together on it. I have 2 different dog beds side by side, and BOTH (!) my 120 and 150lb Danes are laying on this one. Now, I don't understand how they could possibly be comfortable, as they are curled up as small as their giant bodies could allow, but it's clear that they are willing to sacrifice space for the fluff. It looks like I'm going to have to buy another one of these so that they can both have one to themselves. The fact that they made the top of it white is not ideal, but I just put a blanket on top of it so that it doesn't look dirty. For the price, I just don't think you could go wrong."
2442,"Medline Bathtub Bar, Locks to Side of Tub",0/0,5.0,"I am very pleased with this product. For 20 dollars and some change AND free shipping, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item.Easy to install! Out of the box to the bathtub in less than 5 minutes. I was afraid at this price it would be flimsy, but that is not the case; properly tightened the bar does not budge and the person using it weighs 170 pounds.You won't be sorry if you purchase this."

2445,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,4/4,5.0,"I'm an avid backpacker and camper. When I learned about this soap, I was excited about all the uses it claims to have, and wanted to try it. So I ordered the tea tree oil version since I've heard tea tree oil can be an antiseptic, and it's nice having that when cleaning out wounds. I took about three ounces on a four day camping trip, and had about 3/4 of the bottle remaining. I used it for everything I could think of:1) Body wash and Shampoo - The soap left my skin and hair clean, and left a faint, earthy scent.2) Toothpaste - It cleaned my teeth and removed my bad breath, but it was still soap and I was tasting that earthy scent for a little while afterward. Still, it works if you can take the taste.3) Worked into a lather it can be a shaving cream.4) Washed out my pots and pans.5) Washed my clothes and fabrics of dirt and removed nasty smells.Anything I needed cleaned I used it and it worked with just a few drops of soap, and water. I've also heard it can be used to clean floors and wash windows, but I've not tried that yet. I was pleasantly surprised at how many toiletries and cleansers it replaced, and how little I used up when I used it so much. 32 ounces of this stuff is going to last months, even with daily use.This stuff is great for outdoorsmen, campers, backpackers, travelers, or people who want to save money by replacing so many things with one."
2446,IRIS Neat 'n Dry Floor Protection and Training Pads for Puppies and Dogs,0/0,1.0,"These dog pads are way to thin, even for a puppy. I have to put 3 on top of each other. I can't imagine how they can be used on any dog on the picture on the bag. Waste of money and flooring."

But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 25 grams of sugar in the Cookie Crunch! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it. Again, on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein; on the down side, sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy."

2449,Duro-Med Deluxe Sock Aid,0/0,5.0,"Duro-Med Deluxe Sock AidThis is an odd-looking device but it works! Elderly and no longer very flexible, I was having a devil of a time putting my socks on. Someone gave me one of these and it worked so well that I ordered a spare. (Some reviewers have said that the pull-straps disconnected, but I have not experienced this.) It has been a lifesaver for me.Your socks should be large enough to slide on to your foot relatively easily. I can still reach my ankles, which helps, but this should work even if you cannot reach below your knees. I have not any tried similar devices by other manufacturers. Use it sitting down and be sure that the slippery side is toward your skin and the rough cloth side is inserted along the interior of the sock. It's easier to use than to describe."
2450,Wee Gallery Art Cards for Baby,1/1,2.0,"I ordered these when my daughter was about four months old. They're cute and she liked them for about 15 seconds but that's about it. Now she only occasionally chews on the corners. Nice idea, great drawings, but nothing special and certainly nothing interesting to my little one. Possibly because she was too old. When she was a newborn we printed out a FREE pdf of black and white shapes and images off the internet that she loved and stared at for ages. Just, FYI."

2465,Toysmith Zen Garden,1/1,4.0,"When my students approach my desk, they inevitably want to touch and play with the things on it, which sometimes is a problem. This Zen Garden was my solution to this problem. Its so predictable and sweet; a student will stand at my desk, pick up the little rake and start drawing in the sand and say to me, ""Miss, what's this thing for?"" I always smile and reply, ""Just what you are doing right now."" A few have made me laugh as they continue to draw and design in the sand and say, ""Well that's dumb."" To which I reply, ""You're STILL doing it, aren't you?"" :-)I think there is something primal about playing with sand and it has brought joy to my classroom - to my students who now have a little toy and to me because they now have something they should be touching on my desk, and of course the smiles they give me when they do play with it!Is this the best one out there? No, not really. It is a little cheap. One of the legs came off, but I glued it back on. Also, its not very deep, I have to keep the whole thing in the tray that it came it to prevent sand spillage all over my desk - fortunately the box it came in has a nice black cardboard tray that doesn't detract from its appearance. This bottom is also helpful because the wooden garden itself isn't 100% level. The sand is very fine, so it leaves a powder residue around the frame - I use a small make up brush to brush this sand back into the garden.So, no it is not the best one out there, but it does do what its supposed to do and between the rocks and two garden tools it comes with (which have held up well so far - 3 months of use), it is a nice starter set at a decent price. Also, the book that contains the meditations is lovely and a nice part of the set.I had some pretty tumbled rocks I had from when I taught science and replaced the plain brown ones with them and it looks great."
2466,"Hagen Tropican 1.8-Pound Lifetime Maintenance Cockatiel Granules, Standup Zip Bag",0/0,4.0,"Anyone who has birds knows that it's hard to get them to eat pellets, especially if they're already eating seeds! Takes a lot of patience...but he is nibbling this more than any others we've tried. I switch out the seed cup each day and replace for a time with the pellets; I also sprinkle some over his veggie plate when he gets that so he thinks it's a &#34;treat&#34;. These pellets actually smell &#34;good&#34;--sort of fruity."
2467,Jobst Ultrasheer 15-20 Knee-High Silky Beige Large,1/1,3.0,It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings. The Sun Bronze pair fits okay but quality is less than the pair I bought at an actual compression store.
2468,"Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews",0/0,5.0,My husband had a heart attack and is supposed to have 3 helpings of Benocol each day. This works well when we go out to eat. Taste great too!

2470,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,1/1,5.0,This was everything I had hoped for. I read earlier reviews and it performs great. I would highly recommend this product. Can't beat it for the money.
2471,Garden of Eatin' Tortilla Chips,0/0,5.0,"My husband and I live abroad in a chip less country. We had to order them from Amazon, not knowing exactly what they would taste like. They are amazing with guac, salsa, and just on its own. The 12 pack is very convenient because we can use the little bags without worying that they would go stale. They remain crunchy after opening and leaving for a week. Love em!"

2475,"Bed Wedge - Foam Wedge Bed Pillow 7.5""x 26"" x 25"". Comes w/ white pillow cover",0/2,1.0,I ordered this bed pillow wedge for my husbnd. So far it works well keeping him elevated. He sleeps on his side and with a pillow under his head he is comfortable. I tried the more expensive pillow wedges but this was by far the best for the money.
2476,Thomas the Tank Engine Tin Kaleidoscope by Schylling (Includes 1 Kaleidoscope),0/0,5.0,The kaleidoscope was well worth the money. My kids really enjoyed looking at it and we sent it in an operation christmas child box.
2477,Poeme FOR WOMEN by Lancome - 0.14 oz EDP Mini,1/1,3.0,"The fragrance was lovely, and was received in a timely manner. However, after only a couple of uses, the tiny stopper on top of the bottle broke off into the bottle. I notified the company of this, and they defended the product by stating that I may have been too forceful in trying to open the bottle. The stopper is so tiny, that it's difficult to get a good grip on the thing in order to open it. I don't believe I was too forceful; I believe the stopper should have a more manageable top portion, for ease of opening. The company did refund me $3.00, which I applied towards a new bottle of fragrance."

According to the manufacture the reservoir stopped making a food seal and dumped all ...yes all...of the water in the unit onto my hardwood floors.....that was bad .3. I notice a crack and a leak on the replacement unit for the second time .The customer service dept for drinkwell stopped being nice to me since I was returning all these items .Look elsewhere , they only support their product when you threatening to write a poor review"

2483,Bella B Tummy Honey Butter - 4 oz,0/0,2.0,In my experience is too thick and difficult to massage into the skin. Didn't mind the smell. I'm not big enough yet to tell if works for stretch marks. Also there is not much product into the container.

2485,Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge - 1 ea,0/0,5.0,I have used buff puffs for years. I know that some people say they are rough. I don't feel clean without using one. It is the best exfoliant that I have found.
2486,Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage,0/0,5.0,"I have red under eye circles. Very red. When my boyfriend first saw me without makeup, he thought I had allergies or something! I have tried to find a good concealing product for YEARS and have always had problems...not enough coverage, cakey, wears off too soon, I wrote off concealer...until I found this product and the folks at Sephora were nice enough to give me a sample.THIS PRODUCT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED UNDER MY EYES. The circles are GONE all day; I almost forget I have them! It is very thick, so you need a light tough to start.The color is very natural on my skin, which is something I have never been able to say about a concealing product before.I dont spend a lot of money on makeup, so I consider this little splurge totally worth it."
2487,Clubman After Shave Lotion 6 oz.,1/1,4.0,"Nothing makes you feel more like a man than carving up your face with an old fashioned straight razor just before applying this virtual fire to your face. Seriously, the only way you could increase the sensation would be to use molten lead for aftershave. I've found this to be an effective way to wake me up in the morning.I like the smell (which fades fairly early on) and it seems to leave my skin feeling fairly nice after the burning has subsided."
2488,Samba Cologne by Perfumer's Workshop for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"This is a cologne that is light and sweat but, not overpowering, Good for everyday. It is hard to find in departement stores,except occaisonaly in discount outlets. Not expensive but ,does not last as long as some more expensive colognes."

2490,Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt Professional Anti-Static Ion Dryer and Styler,0/1,2.0,"This was such a waste of money for me. I need to pull a brush dryer through very wavy, thick hair in order to straighten and smooth it. The brush on the Sasoon dryer was too soft to work for me. If your hair is thin, it will do just fine."
2491,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,This is an easy way to provide a calming solution to cats that may be a bit anxious.My vet uses this in her office and I have been using it at home.

The only problem I had was when I was putting the little connector on them a few cracked and started to glow. Just a little sensitive. Overall good idea."
2493,"Kong Company DKO77521 Air Dog Squeaker Ball, Medium",0/0,5.0,"These are great squeaky toys and meant for a dog that will squeak it, then give it back. It's not meant for a dog to use as a chew toy. If your dog will not give it back after he/she retrieves it, then it will become a chew toy, and you will have spent a lot of money for a toy that will be destroyed in 1 minute. My dog loves latex squeaky toys but they are hard to find and the squeaker comes out almost immediately. These are more durable, and the squeak is great. She loves the squeak, which makes her chase it, she grabs it, then brings it back to me for more of the same. I'm happy with this product. More importantly, my dog is happy with the product."
2494,Hot Cinnamon Sunset 20 Sachets,0/0,5.0,"If you are looking for a wonderful new tea to add to your already favorites then you need not look any further!

You will definitely not be disappointed with your choice if you do order this tea. Enjoy!"
2495,"Super Pet Crinkle Tunnel, Colors may Vary",0/0,5.0,"I goofed on this one. I thought it was for a cat but it isn't. The diameter is small enough for a squirrel or perhaps a small kitten,it would work well, but not for an adult cat. Good material and seems sturdy/strong."
2496,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,5.0,I bought this for our aging dogs to sleep in at night so they aren't wondering around the house doing their business. It only took a couple of nights for them to get used to it and it's working perfect for our needs.The dogs are comfy and content and if there is an accident it's contained and easy to clean up. It was definitely a good buy.
2497,"Life Extension Melatonin 3mg Dissolving Lozenges, 60-Count",0/0,5.0,"I noticed that the tablets don't really work too well for me and most of the other dissoluble ones I've tried leave me a little groggy the next day. This one also dissolves a lot slower than others (not a plus, just an observation). I get sleepy about 1/2 hour after letting it dissolve and sleep all through the night, even wearing a CPAP. Highly recommend - especially if you have tried Melatonin before and it didn't work as you hoped."
2498,Methigel Urinary Acidifier 4.25 Oz Tube,1/1,5.0,"I first got this from my vet after my female cat was getting UTI's. At first I thought I had to force feed it to her, but it turned out that she loves it! I just put it on the side of her dish in the mornings and it's the first thing she eats. And the best part is that she hasn't had another infection which is great news for me and my floor and my furniture."

2501,Bags on Board Regular Bag Refill Pack,0/0,5.0,"I ordered these bags thinking that they would be the standard old cheapie, you know the ones, super thin, rip apart when you try to tear one off. I was pleasantly surprised with these bags. The quality is very good. I will order these bags again."
2502,Scat Mat Electronic Pet Training Mat,0/0,5.0,I got a new kitchen set and my cat would not stay off the table. I put down the scat mat and it took him getting shocked twice to learn. I can now put food on the table with no fear of the car getting into it. I would highly recommend this product!

2505,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Jumbo Cardboard Blocks (40 pc),0/0,4.0,"We bought this for our little girl who loves to build things with wood blocks. This set of cardboard blocks was just thing to take it to the next (bigger) level and she loves them. The blocks were easy to put them together (though a bit time consuming) and while they don't stand up to being stepped on (it is cardboard after all) they seem very sturdy and they stay in brick shape.My only issue is that there are a lot more of the small, yellow bricks than there are of the big red ones or medium blue ones. The small yellow ones are just a bit bigger than a box of butter while the red ones are shoe box size. Would be nice to have equal amounts of each.Hope you find this helpful!"
2506,Peter's Woven Grass Mat for Rabbits,0/0,5.0,We put it in her cage and she loved it. Next day part of it was gone. She sat on it and ate it. We now have no mat but a happy rabbit. LOL
2507,The First Years Hands Free Gate,0/0,4.0,We needed to spend the extra money on an extension to make it fit in our hallway. The &#34;special&#34; tool needed to adjust it is kind of awkward to use and the foot release is very hard to press down. Even my 6 and 8 year old have a hard time with it.
2508,Scat Mat Electronic Pet Training Mat,0/0,1.0,"Not only does it not work, but it had 4 splotches of gummy susbstance (like used to adhere things) on it that were dirty and obviously this had been returned before. We tried it out and it has a Low, Medium and High Setting. The most powerful setting was Medium, but even that is nothing. Our Golden Retriever literally stood on it without noticing it at all. 2 paws! So we tried it with bare feet and all it does is vibrate. He actually liked it because of the vibration. And yes, we used a new battery and then tested the battery also to make sure it was good (it was). I just don't expect to receive a used item when it is sold as new. Ugh."
2509,"Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee, 3.53-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"I am a grind my beans immediately before roasting kind of guy, and this does the trick for me. Most instant is not worth the displeasure. Starbucks has great instant available, but they are $1 per cup.... For instant! No way. This stuff will get you pretty close to that level for a fraction of the cost."
2510,"Richell Wood Pet Pen 120-90, Autumn Matte Finish",0/0,5.0,"We bought this because our dog was raised in a wire &#34;playpen&#34; in our livingroom. During a remodel of our home, the wire just looked awful in the new livingroom. We are so pleased with this pen. It looks very nice in the livingroom and our dog loves it. The wood trim is very pretty and the door latches are so simple to use. No more clips to fumble with. If you want a cage that will look good in your house, this is the cage for you"
2511,Bach Flower Essences Flower Essence Crab Apple,0/0,5.0,Good product To purchase for duplication at work and home. You should buy this great product for your self and others.
2512,"Nepro with Carb Steady Complete Nutrition, Mixed Berry, Case of 24 Cans",0/0,4.0,"I have to use this product because of my medical condition. Ir has all th nutrients I need for a meal replacement. Ir is a little too sweet for my taste but I usually put it in a blender with ice. It doesn't taste like an ice cream soda but I'm getting used to it. Next time I'll order another flavor.And, by thye way, a couple of the cans came dented."
2513,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,I know this review is in a long list of many. However I was so impressed with this product that I had to express my gratitude for the makers of this flea killing pet control product.I have tried many but this by far surpasses any others. From Hartz to Sergeants etc. This is the one.
2514,Magic 8 Ball,1/1,5.0,"This is great fun!!! I chose it to brighten my day @ the office. I would ask it silly or serious questions, and get a laugh out of the answers, wich are weirdly mostly spot on. Everybody coming in to my office picks it up just to have a laugh.It's the first time that I have seen one, so I cannot compare to any other objects.I can reccomend this for old & young, everybody who has a sense of fun."
2515,Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,4.0,"Medium coverage that can be built up a little bit. If more than about 1.5 layers it can start to look cakey or powdery. Very smooth, natural looking finish. I haven't had any sensitivity with this product, the color is pretty good for my skin tone. I wish there was more product more the price though! Good product overall."
2516,Obus Forme Lowback Backrest Support,0/0,3.0,Its better than nothing but I don't feel its as good as other reviews. It moves around in the bucket seat in my car when I get in and out. Also its pretty bulky. But it is better than nothing but not worth the price. Also everything sticks to the fabric covering.
2517,DEDE Instant Thai Tea Drink with Cream and Sugar - 12 Pockets,0/0,5.0,"This tea is very sweet and creamy, as good Thai tea should be. The 12 packets actually lasted me quite a while, and I'm ordering my next batch soon. Yum!"

The horrendous, disgusting things are still warm on the cookie sheet.I am going to make my boyfriend eat one right now with the instruction that he has to describe the cookie in one sentence.Ha ha. He just spit his one bite back out and said, ""Bad.""What shameful waste of a stick of butter."
2519,Swiss Kriss by Modern Products - 120 Tablets,1/2,5.0,"This is a friend in need. I find when I use 2, it is cramping and not so nice. I have recently begun taking one at night (when needed) and that produces good results. Get the very small joke?"
2520,Garam Masala 7oz,0/0,5.0,"I've been trying out more Indian cuisine, and a one problem I run into is locating ingredients. Many of the spices can be hard to find, or cost an arm and a leg for a small container. With this, you get a nice big bag - nearly a half pound - of high quality spice for cheap. I've used it in a number of recipes, and the flavor is great. Don't bother hunting for less common spices in stores, from now on I'm going to order on Amazon."
2521,Aquolina Pink Sugar,0/0,5.0,"This is my one and only. Wherever I go, people always comment on how wonderful I smell. That is thanks to pink sugar. Who doesn't like cotton candy smelling people?"

2525,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",1/1,5.0,"This is the best product for keeping your pet confined but at the same time allowing your pet the freedom to move around. I actually ended up buying two to enlarge the pen area. It is easy to assemble and easy to slide around on a tile floor. It stands well on carpet as well. I have also used it in the grass and it is very stable. I have a small 18 lb dog and she can lean against it and not knock it over. I have recommended this product to a few of my friends and they love it just as much. I have also brought it to friends houses because it is easy to carry and fits in my small car perfectly. I would highly recommend this pen to anyone who works and does not want to crate their dog. Overall, I am THRILLED I bought this pen."
2526,Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play Playard with Carry Bag,0/0,5.0,This is the best playpen around. The colors are great & the attached designs are like no other. I purchased it when baby was 3 months old He is 9 months now & still enjoys being in it. We have a 2 story house so this is kept in the family room. for naps & play time when we can't provide 100% attention. The attachments are very entertaining. It is bigger than the average playard but not too big. It comes with a nice bag so we just pack it up when we are traveling. We just love Graco!!

Figured I would give it a try. Wallah! With-in a few days I was feeling better than I had in months. I've been doing the maintenance plan of a couple of sprays 2-3 times a week and have not have not had a sinus infection all summer long. I've spread the word among friends and family and they have also seen results.This product will always have a home in my medicine cabinet."
2529,Evenflo 4 Pack Classic Silicone Nipple,0/0,5.0,"This is a pretty basic, no-frills nipple. It fits in the caps on the Gerber BPA free bottles, as well as those rings that come with the tiny disposable formula bottles you get at the hospital or from the doctor. It is x-cut so the flow is pretty quick; however, we needed something with a larger hole because my son would not suck long when he had an ear infection. He was not getting enough calories so the doctor (off the record) recommended putting a bit of rice in the bottle with the breastmilk to boost his calorie intake and to get him to take more ounces in a shorter period of time. His other nipples were clogging- typically he takes a medium flow at 21 weeks old. This is the perfect flow for getting him thicker fluids. The medium is best for just breastmilk at this age. Also, we have used MAM, Born Free, Milkbank, and Dr. Browns with all of our kids and the Evenflo, as well as the similar Gerber style, is his favorite."
2530,Lafeber's Classic Nutri-Berries for Cockatiels 12.5 oz. Tub,0/0,5.0,"I give my small parrot Nutri-berries every morning. He looks forward to them every day. He thinks they are a treat, but they are good for him."
2531,Chinese Exercise Balls,0/0,1.0,"The description states that these are supposed to be 45mm (1.77 inches), but the set that I received is much larger. The circumference of the set I received measures 6 inches/152.4mm (3 inches/76.2mm in diameter), so I'm not sure what the 45mm measurement is supposed to be reflective of. I ordered this set for my 7 year old niece, but I can barely hold them in my hand, let alone move them. I am returning them, and hope to find a more suitable sized set somewhere else."
2532,Mega Green Tea Extract (Decaffeinated),4/4,5.0,"It has been proven that green tea extract does the following and I wanted a product that has minimum caffeine content. This product works fine for me.1. Assists Weight Loss by burning more calories.2.

2537,Dymatize Nutrition - Nutrition Super Amino 23000 mg - 16 fl oz (473 ml),0/0,5.0,"I have tried many such products, even way back in 1970, when was a body builder andnothing compares with this product. After settling on Dymatize Nutrition Liquid Super Amino 2300mg Berry, 32 Ounce. I just set up a subscription of 3 bottles per month delivery. It is that good. Berry is the best tasting flavor. Grape is weierd tasting or the batch I got was not right. For liquid Aminos the berry is tasty. I would recomend this product for general repair of the body, joints, finger nails, hair, cartilage and internal organs. Amino Acids are the building block used by the body to repair and rebuild. Even if you are not active or sports, it is very important to provide your body with high quiality proteins and supplements. By giving to your body this way it goes right to where it is needed. Don't be surprized to see results in as little as two weeks. My finger nails had started getting thin, brittle, cracking and was had a real concern. I thought about going to the doctor about. The the light bulb flashed and remembered my body building days. With in two weeks may finger nails were back to normal. Some of my wrinkles smooth out and hair got thicker. My joints moved better. Okay I will tell you my age is 62 this year. After a couple of months even my mucles have gotten more shape."

2539,Simple Solution Washable Diapers,0/0,5.0,"Read the measurements on our first pair of diapers, and I had to exchange them for the next larger size. They fit our dog perfectly. We no longer have accidents on our tile. We throw ours in the washer/dryer after we fasten the velcro. We started with 2 pairs, and they have exceeded our expectations. Our dog (who is 17) adjusted to wearing them after a week or two. The padding inside absorbs a good deal of urine. Only wish they were available in more colors.Simple Solution Washable Diapers, Small"

2542,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,0/0,5.0,"I don't think there's anything special about this particular band, but it definitely helps my mother (who has elbow/joint pain) to have a band. This one is quite inexpensive and works well, just like the one her physical therapist recommended."
2543,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,1/1,5.0,"My cat definitely LOVES this toy and I have to agree on someone else's review that it too turned my cat into a raging lunatic. I however, love spinning it around. It is easy for me to play with her with such a long pole. I can watch TV, sit back in my chair and just flip it back and forth while she goes crazy. We both get our entertainment. As for some people saying the pole is flimsy or breaks easy, I have to say that if one plays really rough then yes, I could see that. However, I don't think it really is a problem."
2544,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,5.0,This nail polish last for longer than I expected. This is also the first time I use nail polish from the China Glaze collection and I like it. The color is amazing and would be great for the summer or spring.
2545,Uglydoll Classic Plush Doll,0/0,5.0,"My son got his Ice Bat as a gift when he was about 18 months old. He was scared of it for a while and would open his door at night and toss his uglydoll out! It was quite hilarious. He got older, renamed the Ice Bat 'Mr. Burns' and now Mr. Burns has to sleep with him every night. He has had many fun and imaginative adventures with Mr. Burns and our uglydoll has held up to many washings (always on gentle with gentle detergent and in a pillow case and then air dried). I am getting uglydolls for all of the kids in our family this year for christmas. Its a fun toy that is cuddly without being ""babyish""."
2546,Nature's Way SystemWell Immune System,0/0,5.0,Excellent ...period. this natural product must to have able in home all the time. when you start to have a symptoms of coldflu take one.
2547,"Domeboro Astringent Solution, one box of 12 packets",0/0,5.0,"My son got severe hives from a virus - unknown which virus it is - and had SEVERE itching, so much so he was almost hysterical. We were applying all kinds of topical sprays and creams and it would help for a bit but kept itching until the Benadryl kicked in. Saw the allergist and he said NO creams or sprays, they only make things worse due to alcohol in them - that Calamine MIGHT help but otherwise have to keep administering Benadryl, which I didn't want to do. Came home and saw a box of Domeboro my husband got when he had poison ivy - dissolved the powder into water, and applied to my son's itchy areas - provided IMMEDIATE long lasting relief. SO GLAD we have this, because it is on national backorder and not to be found anywhere....oh and the regular price is VERY CHEAP like $12, this price must be $49 due to backorder status."
2548,Vitabath Original Spring Green Moisturizing Bath & Shower Gelee (select option/size),0/0,4.0,"Showering with Vitabath Gel brings back memories of my younger days ~ Vitabath was a luxury when I was in my 20s and has the same affect on me in my 60s ~ sheer luxury, and fresh, clean light fragrance that lingers both in the air and on the body. Lovely. Highly recommend for a perfect holiday gift for that someone specail &#34;who seems to have everything&#34;. (Lois - Parma, OH)"

2550,Osteo-3 Chewable Tablets 90 Count Chewable Tablets,0/0,5.0,I have used Osteo 3 for about 2-3 years on the advise of a veterinarian. Since it is a protective medicine rather than a specific treatment I cannot say for certain that it helps my dog ( she already has hip dysplasia )but I continue to give it hoping that it does help.Amazon always sends the product with a good out date time and a good price when compared with other suppliers and I certainly recommend them.
2551,J.R. Watkins Apothecary Petro-carbo medicated first aid salve 4.37 oz,0/0,5.0,"For years my fingertips will crack and bleed during winter months. It was so painful. No matter what I used it didn't matter. Last winter using this, one time I got a small crack on one finger. And this helped soothe the pain when it did happen. But it didn't last long.I'm sold on using this."
2552,Natural Missst Herbal Hairspray Mist-Super Hold - 8 oz - Spray,0/0,4.0,"This item was as expected. Works great to hold a style for a day but definitely don't apply too much, just a light mist and its good. It does cause build up after a couple days of daily use but since I wash my hair every other day, it doesn't matter to me. If you are looking for a nice natural hairspray then this is a good choice, it holds the style and you don't have to worry about what products you are using on your hair."
2553,Swiss Kriss by Modern Products - 120 Tablets,2/2,5.0,"Ever since being on a long course of strong antibiotics for a MRSA infection a few years ago I have suffered from constipation off and on and hemmoroids (I can't spell that!) because of it. I tried stool softeners, which gave me some relief...laxatives, which I hated and were too harsh...and then I stumbled upon Swiss Kriss. I take 1/2 pill each evening and it keeps things moving well, if a little too loosely (I know, just gross to talk about...but it is, what it is). No discomfort and keeps me regular...damn, I must be getting old to be reviewing this! Oh well...I love this product! Thank you!"
2554,Boswellia 400 mg 100 Caps - Swanson Premium,0/0,5.0,This was a great product. I would buy this product again. Really helps with inflammation. Thank you. :) See ya soon for another order.
2555,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,5.0,"The scratching post lives up to all expectations. A friend also ordered it and her cats love it as well.If your cat ignores it at first, there are many things you can try.-Rub cat nip on on the post.-Use the post yourself and act like it's really fun ""Oh wow, that feels great on my claws! Oooh, so nice!"" I have a young cat who is incredibly interested in everything I do, so this did peak her interest.-Use a favorite toy to get the cat to interact with the post.-Give the cat treats for touching the posts at first and then for scratching the post. Using the post is the only thing that my cat can do it get treats. She frequently scratches at it, stops to stare at me and continues.-NEVER do anything that could result in the cat associating the post with punishment. Ever.-Do spray your cat if they use any inappropriate object, but do not place them at the post afterwards.-Make sure the post is placed in a vibrant part of the house where the cat enjoys spending time. Your cat is not going to go into the basement to stretch his or her paws.Good luck!"
2556,HALO Newborn Micro-Fleece Sleepsack Swaddle,0/0,5.0,"Our daughter received one of these in the hospital. She will not sleep without it! The cotton fabric is nice for warmer evenings. However, the micro fleece is great for colder fall and winter evenings. Under the wrap we used long sleeved shirts on warmer evenings. The long sleeved shirts underneath were more convenient for changing diapers in the middle of the night. On colder nights we use Gerber sleep sacks underneath. My daughter is a couple of months old and we have already purchased the next size sleepsack. Thank you Halo. Fabulous!"
2557,Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Changing Pad Cover,0/0,5.0,"After a few diaper changing ""accidents"" it became quite obvious that having a few of these change pad covers is essential. Fortunately we had ordered them in advance, and were happy to have them with us. They are soft and plush, and our baby feels comfortable on it. They also seem to be largely water repellant, which, again, is a great feature. They are easy to wash and clean, and we've had only the best experience with them thus far. Highly recommended."
2558,"Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,It was awesome! My boyfriend was super happy to have it! The produce came very fast and in great shape! Got a lot for my money!

2560,Body Back Buddy Jr. and the BBB-Mini,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this on a friends recommendation and have been using it for a couple months now. I had been using a Thera-cane at physical therapy. It seemed fairly limited in its use though. My friend just happened to have the full size Body Back Buddy (blue one). It was remarkable yet a bit large for me. I am only 140 lbs. This Junior model (purple one) is perfect. I use it for my Trapezoids, Cervical muscles as well as trigger points on feet. The mini is a bit limited, yet great for work and travel, it fits in my lunch cooler. Well built of solid materials."
2561,Button Cell Type 371 Battery,0/0,1.0,"I bought this item because it is displayed as the brand VARTA. However, this seller is sending me a button battery with a different brand and explained the brand is just as good as VARTA. Obviously the image displayed on this item is cheating people from buying it."

2565,OPI Classics Nail Polish,1/1,5.0,Every woman should own this color. Get for hands or feet. Beautiful color with a subtle sparkle. Bought one for me and one for my best friend!
2566,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,5.0,"As new parents we didn't know what diapers to use. We received many diaper brands including Pampers with our baby shower. However, the Swaddlers were the best out of all of them. When we were trying to use the other brands, our daughter's skin got irritated causing the top layer to peel off. That ended up in a trip to the doctor. We then switched back to the Swaddlers and haven't had an issue. The yellow strip has been useful to us as well. Initially our daughter would cry everytime she had a wet diaper, however, when she was smaller, we would not have been able to tell that she had a wet diaper had it not been for the ""code blue"" strip. Yes we went through a ton of diapers, but it saved us lots of headaches because she would always stop crying after her diaper had been changed. Now she is older, and you can tell without the ""code blue strip"", but in the beginning it was a life saver. I recommend Pampers Swaddlers from my experience, and these will be the only diapers I ever give at baby showers."
2567,Melissa & Doug Playful Pets Jigsaw (12 pc),1/1,5.0,I have bought my 3 year old granddaughter several of these puzzles. The Melissa & Doug puzzles are very well made. My granddaughter plays with them over and over.
2568,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,0/0,3.0,"The fiber don't adhere to my hair as well as I would like. I think I needed to buy the hair spray, but once you do get them in place, they seem to stay there. I'm keeping it."
2569,"Airheads- Assorted Flavors, 90ct (Variety Pack)",0/0,5.0,I luv them. Made a good Halloween treat for the Cub Scouts. I even had enough for me to enjoy.
2570,Jenga - 2006 Edition,2/2,4.0,We keep this on our RV and play often when we're camping. The packaging is durable and holds up routine use.
2571,J. DEL POZO IN BLACK For Women By JESUS DEL POZO Eau De Toilette Spray,2/2,5.0,"Del Pozo In Black EdT by Jesus del Pozo is one of my all-time favorites. Though it's listed here as being ""for men"", it's 100% suitable for women. If you're a woman who loves rich, exotic, unique scents with amazing sillage, this is for you. It's unlike any other fragrance. The notes are"
2572,Moist Heating Pads - TheraTherm Digital Moist Heating Pads,0/0,5.0,"Bar none, if you use this heating pad you will never use any other brand period! The best ever. I am on my 3rd one in about 12 years, I can not live without it! The new larger digital controller is much more user friendly, and easy to see. I am going to purchase another for my mother who suffers from a bad hip, it will help her greatly to have this heating pad. Amazon has the best price, and yes I did compare. Delivery was prompt and well packaged. Thanks!"
2573,Pureology Texture Twist 3 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS - USUALLY BOUGHT IT AT MY HAIR SALON BUT COULD NO LONG GET IT THERE. THE PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS - VERY SPEEDY. AND, AS ALWAYS, THE PURELOGY PRODUCT IS GREAT."
2574,Kinesio Tex Tape,0/0,5.0,"This stuff is miraculous. I suffer from arthritis in my finger joints. Taping my hand with K tape has given me the first pain free days (without meds) that I've had in years. If I am careful, the tape lasts on my hand up to 48 hours, through hand washing and showers. I have been warned that I wear it too much and that might be hard on my skin but I just have to hope they are wrong."
2575,Synthetic Vinyl Powder Free Glove,0/0,5.0,"Couldn't live without them I take care of an elderly Dad and they are worth having, they do have a tendency to rip a little if you are pulling them on in a hurry."
2576,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magnetic Calendar,0/0,5.0,Great little calendar. My 3 year old loves it. I wish it came with more blank magnets to create our own special days.
2577,Sanitary Pooper Scooper,0/0,5.0,"Well build, well designed pooper scooper... hard to find in hardware stores, reasonably priced, fully functional, works well in unmoved grass. Convenient to use. My dog loves watching me use it."
2578,"Gerber Graduates BPA Free Bunch-A-Bowls with Lids, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,These bowls are just the right size for serving and storing. The colors are great too. The fact that they are dishwasher safe makes them a real basic to have around and you can't beat the price.
2579,Lord of the Rings Figure 3 Pack,0/0,4.0,"Overall, this product will do a great collection piece for any LOTR / JRR Tolkien fan. I actually use them as decoration for my cubicle at my job, and most people stands by and comment.Yet, consider this for display, not as a toy for properly playing, since they won't take the usage and survive. Bases, arms and weapons can fall off if played with. Consider as well these are very rare and no longer produced.I'm taking one star off since for the price I would expect them to be more carefully painted and cutted, but you won't notice unless you stare closely at them."
2580,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,2.0,Product works fine but it is not that effective as mentioned in few reviews. It gets overheated soon. Buy a fan which makes consistence sound that might work better for your sleep.
2581,Omnia Perfume by Bvlgari for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"I own 4 parfums, but this was different fromwhat I expected, still very nice.I want minis to travel with.OMnia Coral is incredible my favorite."
2582,LifeSource UB-512 Advanced Memory Wrist Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor,1/1,4.0,Seems accurate but you must make sure that you are holding it over your heart otherwise you get strange readings. Delivered on time and undamaged.
2583,IRIS Puppy and Dog Training Pad Holder,0/1,5.0,"I love this tray. I have a Yorkie and he is house broken and wont use the pad. Because he is so cold all the time I put this under his pillow, and it puts insulation between his pillow and the floor. He loves it."
2584,How to Host a Murder,0/0,5.0,We had so much fun paying this game! It was great that there were no scripts - it allowed for more wiggle room. Even the people I thought would be not into the game performed their role well. I will warn you - the murderer is completely improbable...but nevertheless we had a great time. Highly recommended to others!
2585,"Source Naturals Ultra Colloidal Silver Throat Spray, 10 ppm",0/0,5.0,"I purchased this to take along on a flight and managed to stay healthy by spraying it in my throat often. I love this product for when my throat gets sore, also."
2586,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,"I bought this coat for my small dog (chihuahua)not because I believe in ""dressing up"" dogs, but because he gets very cold in the winter. But, I gotta tell ya - it looks so cute on him. You can also tell he is comfortable in it. Easy on and off, well made and warm. It will be his ""coat"" for a long time."
2587,NICORETTE GUM 4 MG KIT ORIG Size,0/0,5.0,I loved the price and I have ordered from this company before and was pleased. I like that I got it early and in perfect shape. I would recommend this company to all my friends
2588,"Almay Clear Complexion Makeup, (VARIED COLORS) 1 fl oz (30 ml)",0/0,5.0,"This make-up goes on smoothe and stays on all day. It looks wonderful, doesn't shift or cake, or change color. I simply just love this makeup. It's all I have used for years."
2589,"Supersmile Professional Whitening System, Small or Large",5/5,1.0,"I should have read all the reviews before reading. Sorry SSW System, the paste alone does not work. Perhaps Amazon should not carry it."

2593,"Jarrow Formulas - Citicoline Cdp Choline, 250mg, 60 capsules",3/3,5.0,"I started taking the product because, at 51, I felt as though my cognitive abilities were beginning to diminish, especially in the afternoon. I would sometimes forget where I put things, and felt a little ""fuzzy"" at the end of the day. It took about a month to see the effects, but if you're looking for something to provide clarity, focus and boost cognition, this stuff really works. I'm back to my old self, don't forget where I put things, and am thinking as clearly and as fast as ever. I highly recommend it."
2594,"Celestial Seasonings Ice Cool Brew Iced Tea, Peach, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,3.0,"I liked the ""idea"" of a cool brew, but if you actually drink a lot of tea it's just not that practical. It takes 16 bags to brew a gallon, and since I typically brew 2 gallons at a time that's basically one box per one batch of tea. Directions say steep for 5-10 minutes but I find that produces a pretty weak tea if you're actually using cold water. I've found hot water from the tap produces the best flavor for that 5-10 steeping time, but then you do have to cool the tea to drink it, so kind of beside the point. It does have a really good flavor, but don't think I will repurchase."
2595,Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,0/0,4.0,My kids fight over who gets to have this in the car/stroller. We had to order a 2nd one. Perfect for parents on the run who need to feed kids in the car. fits under the stroller when we collapse it. only thing is getting the strap behind the car seat.
2596,Elizabeth Arden Millenium Hydrating Cleanser Facial Cleansing Creams,0/0,1.0,This is either counterfeit merchandise (in legitimate jars) or so old that the cream has separated beyond reconstitution. The consistency is nothing like the product we have used for 25 years.
2597,Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,0/0,1.0,This product is difficult to put together. We use it occasionally for grandchildren and the piece is already bent from trying to put it up in place about 6 times. I would not recommend this product.
2598,Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug,1/1,5.0,We ordered this for our Grandson's first birthday. I have not seen it in person .....only in a video of our Grandson walking and pushing the Wheely Bug. If giggles are any indication of how much he likes it then he must love it. His Mom does verify that he really likes it.
2599,Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,0/0,5.0,"Good Quality and really useful for busy mamas :) Aldo my baby seems a little small for it still, i'm sure i will be able to use it pretty soon. Love it!"
2600,Outdoor Feline Funhouse,0/0,5.0,"My last cat loved this. She loved sitting out on the deck with us in her tent and watching birds. Our new kitty is not yet a fan, but she does not even like being confined to a room. As soon as we put her in, she just goes nuts trying to escape and doesn't even notice she has made it outside, if you have a cat who is laid back and curious about being outside, they would probably love it."
2601,JOSEPH ABBOUD by EuroItalia EDT .16 OZ MINI,0/0,5.0,I love cedar wood note and this cologne has it. Funny the very first time i smelled it i didn't like it.
2602,"Playmaker Toys Flingshot Flying Animal - Flying Cow With Mooing Sound, Model# 4551",0/0,4.0,"The item was well packaged, new and with a label. I wish it was easier to get to make the noise when slung across the room."
2603,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"I love this machine. I have had trouble sleeping and staying asleep for quite a few years now. This summer I discovered that while I was using a fan in my bedroom (something, I haven't done in the past, because I used my AC)I was sleeping so much better, ie; for some reason unknown to myself, the fan helped me to go to sleep and stay asleep much better, so I started reading up on it and discovered the benefits of ""white noise"". Well summer ended and I needed something other than a fan to help me sleep and besides the fan was making my room to cold. So I tried the Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner by Marpac and it worked wonders (even better than the fan). It takes up a lot less space and can be used year around. I would highly recommend this little machine to anyone who has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. For myself, once I became a mom, I had developed what I call ""mom hearing"" when I was sleeping, and by that I mean every little noise woke me up. My kids are now older and I couldn't seem to go back to the kind of sleep I had before having children, and it only got worse as I got older, but thanks to this little machine, I have enjoyed much much better sleep. I don't think I will ever not use it again, I am a believer. Also, I will add that I received the item promptly and in great condition. Thank you."

The aquarium is in my office and the pumps are extremely quiet. I used flexible hose to connect them to the plumbing. No vibration, no sound. At 5' of head, I'm assuming I'm getting 3,000 gph from the 4200."
2605,"Nutri-Pet Research Nupro Joint Supplement for Dogs, 5-Pound",0/0,1.0,I brought this product because it was reccomended very highly. My beautiful laborador boys got so sick vomiting and diarrea that i stopped this powder immediately. My cousins dogs do very well on this powder.I will give the leftover to her.
2606,Hagen Hagen Vision 2 Bird Cage,0/0,5.0,Absolutely no seed spill over; easy to open and clean; .... a joy. I recommended this cage to all bird lovers.
2607,Hot Wheels Molded 48 Car Case - Colors and Styles May Vary,0/0,5.0,"This is a great case for lots of cars. We have had it for over a year and it is still in perfect condition. It has a few large slots for bigger cars/jets, but most of them are small and hold one to two hot wheels cars."
2608,"Dynarex Sensi Wrap Self Adherent Bandages, Rainbow Colors",0/0,5.0,Works just as well as what I paid $2 a roll for and the colors are fun. An excellent value.
2609,Diphenhydramine HCl 25 Mg Allergy Medicine and Antihistamine Compare to Active Ingredient of Benadryl Allergy Generic - 400 Tablets,0/0,5.0,"They have had no complaints, and the price was great. I'm sure they would have commented if they had problems with the difference between this generic product and the branded one."
2610,Daily Select for Medium Birds - 8 lb.,0/0,5.0,It was just what we wanted. No local pet stores are carrying this any longer. It was also much less than we had been paying locally.
2611,Small World Living Toys Peel 'N' Play,0/0,4.0,My 3 yr old likes to pretend she is cutting up vegetables. Fun to play with and she can learn the different vegetables.

White Toplayer, Moderate Absorbency, Soaker Ounce 8oz., Each,PINK",0/0,5.0,"I was looking for something to protect the bed while potty training my daughter. I didn't want to have to use diapers at night by I think it defeats the purpose of potty training. Anywho, she had her first a cident weeks after I got this and I was thankful it did its job. Sheets were dried, I washed it and dried it and it didn't shrink or anything. Will definitely buy another to keep it as backup !"
2613,Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,0/0,4.0,Very good for its price but it is little be small which may be considered as advantage. Very good quality.
2614,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"Love, love, love this for my kitten and he likes it too! It's easy to clean, all you have to do is roll it and it sifts out all the kitty waste. It takes a few times to get the hang of it, but really I don't know why anyone would dislike it. I can see how it could maybe break easily, like with the clips that hold the top on it, but honestly if you are careful with it and use it the right way you should have no problem. As it says on the directions to use clumping litter, for our kitty we use Arm & Hammer Double Duty, this litter combined with the litter box is excellent. People don't realize we even have a cat, we never smell it. I am so glad we have it! :-)"
2615,Cuba Black Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,"ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY BROTHER IN LAW, HE SAID THAT IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD COLODNE. HE WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT DISSAPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS ""HAVANA"", WHICH IS NOT ABLE TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE. BOTTOM LINE, IT IS A DECENT SCENT AND HE IS HAPPY WITH IT."
2616,"SugarTwin, Granulated Brown Calorie Free Sweetener, 2.85-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,1.0,"I didn't buy this product from Amazon, but I've used both the brown sugar version and regular granulated sugar offerings from Sugar Twin. They have a strong metallic taste that is palpable even when mixed with other ingredients. I replaced a small amount of brown sugar with sugar twin (about 1/4 of the total sugar in the recipe), and the finished baked goods tasted overwhelmingly like metal. The same thing occurred a few months ago with the white sugar version (I should've learned from that experience and just avoided the line of products altogether). I definitely do not recommend this product."
2617,Hylands Kids Kit,3/4,5.0,"Seriously the best product hands-down I bought for my little one. We used the chamomile, arnica, and bumps n' bruises ointment like crazy. Especially after getting shots at the doctor or really any ""owies"". A must-have for teething times and just any time you know your babe isn't feeling so well but not necessarily sick enough to take to the doctor. We lucked out and and made it to 19 months before our first child developed anything other than a minor sniffles. We know it had a lot to do with having this kit on hand."

2620,Graco Duoglider Twin Doll Stroller,1/1,5.0,I bought 2 of these strollers for my girls. One is 6 and the other is 2. I looked for months. I'm so happy the front wheels swivel. Based on the reviews I knew I couldn't go wrong. However I found it for muuuuuuuchhhhhhh cheaper at a popular toy store. Being I needed 2 plus the deal this store had I was so excited to get both for under 55 dollars. TOTAL!!!! AWESOM STROLLER!! But shop around!!
2621,"Flexi Retractable All Belt Lead, 16ft",0/0,5.0,"This probably is the best, most quality, most luxurious leash I've ever held!It's on par with the other ones from Flexi, however this leash is a bit bigger, stronger, than the purple/pink one they sell.Good for dogs upto 40LBS, calm dogs perhaps 50LBS."
2622,Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster,1/1,3.0,"I have twin grandsons and wanted something to use when they were at my house. I didn't want to spend very much, since they would see limited use. These are okay, but not great. It is hard to get the tray on and off. They do fold up and will probably go with us to family for Christmas. They do not recline, so would not work well until a baby can sit. If you want a chair to keep in your trunk for when you go somewhere, this would probably work well. If you are wanting something to use on a daily basis, spend a little more and get something that is easier to use and will hold up well."
2623,Neutrogena Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot Cream,0/0,4.0,I've used this for many years and it is very effective in moisturizing my feet. I even bring it when I travel to make sure I don't miss a night. My only issue with this vendor is that the photo shows a white tube which made me think it was the old formula. What they actually deliver is the maroon tube that is the newer formula. Both are effective but I have a personal preference for the old formula.
2624,Flattopper Orig With Level*beige,0/0,5.0,"I love this tool!!! I am a hairstylist and learned to use this tool right after getting out of beauty school. No one in the salon knew how to or was comfortable enough with cutting a Flat-Top. This tool has enabled me to construct a precise Flat-Top in a very short amount of time. Consequently, I have ALL the Flat-top clientele and the tips are generous."
2625,France Luxe Elysee Barrette - Classic,1/1,2.0,"This barrette is promoted as being best for those with thick hair. Although the pattern of the decorative 'onyx' is attractive, the actual holding mechanism for your hair is not nearly sturdy enough or made well enough to warrant the price. I could not get all my hair into the barrette at the same time to create a nice, low pony tail. In a nutshell, to all out there with truly THICK hair, this barrette is not worth the money and good luck getting it to do what you want it to. As a side note, I also purchased an inexpensive Goody hair product along with this order. The Goody is certainly not as fancy as the France Luxe but it holds all my hair without any problems and it was less than $7."
2626,Super Colon Cleanse with Herbs & Acidophilus By Health Plus - 240 Capsules,0/0,3.0,"Took the pills as required, however only the same effect I've gotten from xlax. Was truly hoping for a cleansing. I guess this just works for some people."
2627,"Navitas Naturals Goji Berries, 16-Ounce Pouches",0/0,4.0,This fills my desire to add Goji berries to my Nutribullet shakes in order to increase the nutritional content. I would order again.
2628,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,5.0,I found the food coloring very easy to work with. Didn't stain my hands and colors were bright and deep.
2629,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,2.0,"1. Cheap Price (+)2. Smells Weird (-)3. When you pull out one tissue, next one will stay out like dry tissue (-)"
2630,Carex Cervical Collar,0/0,4.0,"Used for a Halloween Costume. While a little warm, It Worked great. I went as a W%%&&*Mart shopper. Not sure what I will do with it now."
2631,Conquest of the Empire by Eagle Games,0/1,5.0,"Ludus bonus est! Aut viam faciam, aut inveniam. Alea iacta est. Nunc scio quid sit amor... Vale, Amice...Senator Phillippus S.P.Q.R."
2632,"Eden Organic Dry Roasted Seeds, Spicy Pumpkin, 4-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 15)",0/0,5.0,Eden's Dry Roasted Spicy Pumpkin Seeds have an excellent taste. Just enough spice without being too hot to enjoy. I would recommend these any time!!!
2633,Fisher Price View Master Look and Learn - Marine Life,1/1,3.0,"I was really excited to have some reels that have some educational value. My son loves his view master and the sample reel that came with it. That reel has vivid colors making it easy to see. This one of marine life has subtle colors since the photos are underwater making them very difficult to see. Total disappointment and waste of money, hence the rating."
2634,Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,This is the only prenatal vitamin I have taken but I haven't had any problems with it. It did not seem to make me more nauseous or gassy than usual. It is a high quality prenatal vitamin at a great price.
2635,Accoutrements Sherlock Holmes Action Figure,0/0,5.0,This is the best Sherlock Holmes action figure that I have been able to find.I display it above my small bookshelf.
2636,"StoneTech APCC4-1G Professional All-Purpose Stone and Tile Cleaner, 1-Gallon",0/0,1.0,The reason for giving this product only 1 star is simple. Strictly from a sanitary perspective I don't doubt that it cleans as well as any other product. However I have black granite which shows everything and StoneTech All-Purpose Stone and Tile Cleaner leaves streak marks. My whole purpose for buying the product was so I could showcase my beautiful new granite counter tops. I went back to using Glass Plus which is ammonia free and I continue to be very pleased with the results.
2637,Volkman Avian Science Parakeet Bird Seed 4 Lb,0/0,5.0,"I was never able to get my parakeets to eat fresh fruits or veggies, they were just never interested no matter how hard I tried. Volkman bird food has dried vegetables and fruits in it and is the best value by pound. I've gone to the pet store and seen top brands that only have processed ""vitamin pellets"" and they were $8 for a 2lb bag.I'm incredibly happy that I found Volkman on Amazon because I've only found one store in my area that sells it and it's a 40 minute away from me. I'm all for supporting local businesses but with gas as expensive as it is, it's difficult justifying driving 40 minutes one way to buy bird food.I highly suggest any of Volkman Avian Science Super bird food blends because of their high quality and great value."
2638,Polar Lights Star Trek Nemesis Scorpion Model Kit,0/0,4.0,"Bought this for a diorama and do not regret it. Took only a little jimmying and filling to get it paintable and presentable. Looks good in the scene. Easy to build. Don't know how accurate it would appear to Star Trek aficionados, but it was well-made and useful for my purposes."
2639,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister in law's dog. He's a 5 or 6 year old mix breed (lab size) who loves stuffed toys. He LOVES his squirrel toy! He very gently pulls the squirrels out and shakes them around. I was honestly surprised at how much he likes it! I would definitely recommend.
2640,The Wet Brush,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this for my daughter, who has long, very thick hair. After trying many different kinds of brushes and having only moderate success, I decided to take a chance on this one based on reviews. WHAT A BUY!!! She no longer complains when I brush her hair either wet or dry, and after a year it's still going strong! Don't look any further, this is the brush for anyone whose hair tends to knot and tangle!"
2641,Nutramax Cosequin for Cats - 80 Sprinkle Capsules,0/0,4.0,Big savings over the Vets fee. I blend it with baby food chicken and it is well tolerated by my cat.
2642,Badger Basket Doll High Chair With Plate Bib And Spoon - Pink/White,0/0,3.0,I is sturdy and was easy to put together. I wouldn't say its the greatest quality but for the price it is well worth it and my daughters love it!
2643,Amarelli Spezzata Licorice 40g pastilles by Amarelli,0/0,5.0,"This is definitely not your standard licorice candy. It's very sharp and kind of bitter, with a very distinct and long-lasting aftertaste. Personally I think it's great, and am ordering more right now, but don't expect it to taste anything like anything you'd find in the candy section. Try chewing some anise or fennel, which you can find at more upscale grocery stores. It tastes a bit like that."
2644,Source Naturals L-Theanine 200mg,1/1,5.0,"Due to a mild condition that may sometimes cause me to get a bit of jittery feelings in my stomach at times, I take L-Theanine.Many of us experience some jitters, maybe too much caffeine, or something in your life worries you. This is just the thing to use to stop those jitters and calm us down.I have used this on occasion to help just before sleep also.I have never had any side effects only pleasant calmness that follows shortly after ingesting these.I have this on auto delivery, besides costing a little less I do not pay shipping, that is a plus. Auto delivery can be controlled by you as to how often you get them"
2645,Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Foundation SPF18 Foundation Makeup,0/0,1.0,Ok this foundation that this person is selling for several dollars is available at your local dollar tree for a buck !! Thats where they bought it at
2646,Nature's Way Cranberry Fruit,0/0,3.0,I don't see a difference between this product and many others. Cranberry supplements do seem to help me avoid bladder infections.
2647,Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Bounce & Spin Zebra,0/0,5.0,"I would recommend this gift to anyone who has a little one! Our little grandson just learned how to walk now and loves climbing ON things, this is one item that my daughter dosen't mind him climbing on and it seems to be a big accomplishment in my grandsons eyes when he's ON this. Keeps him out of trouble for a little while! LOL! Great Toy!!"
2648,Devil Duck,0/0,4.0,my daughter loves ducks and i bought this one for her and she loves it. it goes everywhere with us and even through chewing on it its held up
2649,Zippo Street Chrome Pocket Lighter,0/0,5.0,"Nice lighter, great weight in the hand. Works a lots better than those bic lighters, no comparison with the quality. Works with no hassle."
2650,Maxell Watch Battery Button Cell LR41 AG3 192 Pack of 10 Batteries,0/1,5.0,"You cannot beat the price for these batteries. They worked great in the devices I put them in, and I have some extras for the next time. I would highly recommend."
2651,Bratz Midnight Dance - Meygan,0/0,5.0,"I don't understand how ignorant and judgmental people can be sometimes. This is a perfectly fine doll. It is wearing layers of clothing so I don't understand how it can be interpreted as ""slutty"". As for the gothic image they were aiming for, they did a nice job. I resent the comments addressing gothic culture as satanic. You are leaking your ignorance onto the context of your review. I myself dress in a gothic attire. I am Christian I go to church every Sunday and pray to my lord every night. Not once have my style of dress taught me to turn way to Satan. it's a freaking style for crying, should we save cheerleaders are sluts because their skirts are too short or that girls that by designer clothing are artificial? I really hope that you are a kid because it's not is it ethical to judge somebody on the wardrobe they have. If you are an adult, I can only pray that your ignorance does not taint society."
2652,"ARTEC Kiwi Coloreflector Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,I love this product and have used it for years - makes my hair feel clean and shiny. Evidently it's being discontinued which really disappoints me.
2653,Pronex - Cervical Traction Device - Size Regular,1/1,5.0,"Works great! This is my second one in 20 years, Easy to use and a great price at Amazon. Easy to store and setup."
2654,Panasonic EV2510K Reach Easy Rolling Massager,0/0,5.0,This is an excellent product and worth buying! Very easy to use and portable to carry.Highly recommended for friends /n family.
2655,Herbalife Formula 3 - Cell Activator (60 capsules),1/1,2.0,"Everything was ok I received the product early than I expected but the only bad thing that I noticed is that I couln'd find an expiration day in the bottle, so this is very suspicious cuz I don't know if I'll be taking somethimg that it is out of date.Only for that he gets only 2 stars."
2656,Rubik's Cube,1/1,1.0,"This is a cheap knock off of the rubiks cube, for all intensive purposes its a rubiks cube but when I went to lubricate the cubes, I found out that they are bottomless and hollow which made it impossible to lubricate. The cube is difficult to twist and turn."
2657,"Hydor Automatic Fish Feeder -Battery Powered, with Air Connection - Original EkoMixo",0/0,5.0,"not sure about all the whining, this is my 3rd one ( I have 3 tanks) they work perfectly, not a problem yet...had about a year....keeps food dry via air hose connection...easy selection 1,2, or 3 times per day."
2658,OPTP Original McKenzie Lumbar Roll (Standard) 701,1/1,1.0,"After a week on my chair this thing was out of round and the strap could not keep it on my chair. It falls down and is misshapen, hardly of use. I wish I had bought something else because this thing is hardly even usable now. Spend your money on something else and you'll be better off."
2659,Play Money in Bulk,0/0,5.0,"I used them for decoration for our Candlelight service we have every year for our families. Theme this year was Pennies from Heaven. Our service is not till Dec. 11th, will send a pict. after if you would like. Thank you, I am please with what I received.I work for a Mortuary and we have a different theme each year. This product will work great.Gail"

2661,"Ck One by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette",0/1,1.0,"CK one 3.4 oz, I received a perfume that was previously opened. The plastic wrap around the box was missing. It doesn't say that in the description. I feel cheated. Do not buy this if it is for a gift."
2662,Brushtech Sports Bottle Straw Washing Brush B23C,0/0,5.0,"I have been using the cups with straws for a while now and have thrown away the straws because the germs gross me out, so this cleaner has been VERY helpful!"
2663,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,0/2,5.0,I love this product. I have used it for Halloween the past two years. This arrived in good time and was new. Thanks
2664,Heel Inc Traumeel,0/0,5.0,"For diminishing pain in a knee as an alternative to surgery, this ointment can't be beat. I apply it once a day in the mornning."
2665,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,"this mat is thicker than most i have seen for the price. it washes and dries really well. i have a German wire hair who likes to chew, he has not destroyed this YET. so it seems durable."
2666,"Sally Hansen Double Duty Base and Top Coat, 0.45 Fluid Ounce",1/1,1.0,"I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues. As a base coat, Double Duty works decently. I use a lot of polishes containing glitter, and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes - otherwise the glitter sticks to my nails and is next to impossible to remove. However, it also tends to peel up at my cuticles, and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet. It makes removing polish easy and fun (but horribly unhealthy for my nails).As a top coat, this product is the worst. I can let my nails dry for 4 hours, go to bed, and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails. Hours after using it, I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it. There are other base/top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better. Would not recommend."
2667,"Batiste Dry Shampoo, 5.05 fl. oz.",1/2,5.0,"I used to wash my hair every other day. but the that second day, I would have greasy gross hair and would have to wear it up in a bun. I now wash my hair every 3-4 days and my hair looks better than that 2nd greasy hair day before I discovered this amazing stuff! I can now wear my hair down all the time!! I LOVE THIS STUFF and im stocking up! PS I spray it in my hair/bangs the day after I washed my hair. So I spray at night before bed and again in the morning, everyday (except the day I washed my hair). I got the tropical scent and I love it. I currently have dark hair and it does make my hair white/gray for a few seconds after I spray but I just brush it and it's gone. Not even an issue. It dissappears quick."
2668,Paris Hilton Fragrances - Paris Hilton Men Spray,0/0,4.0,It is what I expected and wanted. (I am adding in these extra key strokes because without them the &#34;submit&#34; button would not activate.)
2669,Source Naturals Phosphatidyl Serine Matrix 500mg,0/0,5.0,"I first started using Phosphatidyl Serine when I was searching for supplements to help with memory loss after a mild stroke. At 300 mg two times a day, Phosphatidyl Serine was recommended to me by a nutritionist. I originally bought it at GNC at $39.99 for a bottle of 30 softgels. It made a huge difference, especially when taken with DMAE, Lecithin, and selenium. I'm just starting the Source Naturals Phosphatidyl Serine Matrix product. It's a lot cheaper, and the mg are higher. So far, it has met my expectations!"
2670,Flowbee Hair Cutter,0/0,5.0,"Okay, I just took delivery of a current (Nov 2012) Flowbee haircutting system w/the Super Mini-Vac for ~$140 (including shipping) direct from the company, and just tried it out. I'm happy to report that it worked great, did a great job, it was fast, clean (if a bit noisy), and that Mini-Vac was more than powerful enough for the job. I previously bought a used Flowbee which (sort of) connected to a regular vacuum cleaner, and it worked okay, but I would spend at least 20 mins to a half-hour scrubbing that thing across my head, trying to get it to cut my hair, which it eventually did. Maybe it was because it was old, or maybe it was because my vacuum cleaner wasn't strong enough, but after a few years I had to work harder and hard to get the thing to work. Eventually, the poor thing died on me. It was still worth the $$ as I still saved $15 a pop (plus another $5 tip) from going to the barbershop. Hopefully, it'll still be working fine 10 years from now - now *that* would really make it totally worthwhile."
2671,"Body Back Buddy, Mini",0/0,4.0,It worked extremely well. Helps to relieve the aches from hours on the computer when no one is around. Doesn't take up alot of space to store.
2672,"HoMedics SS-2000E Sound Spa Nature Sounds Machine with 6 Nature Sounds, Silver",0/0,5.0,"I was having trouble getting to or staying asleep at night. I was regularly waking up (once I did fall asleep) at 2 or 3 in the morning. I decided I would not get up to read or have a cup of tea because I was still tired. The sound machine was the soloution for me. Mostly, I use the ocean wave setting, but I have also used the summer night sounds, the waterfall, and the rainforest. They definitely lull me to sleep. The beating heart one gives me the creeps, so I never use that. It reminds me too much of ""A Telltale Heart"", the story by Edgar Allen Poe, which always scared me to death! (I can see that one being used for a baby since it mimics the sound of a mother's heartbeat, though)"
2673,"Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat, 0.45 Fluid Ounce",1/1,1.0,"I bought this top coat because it says right on the packaging ""no chip"". I put it on before bedtime and made sure it dried completely before I went to sleep. After I woke up I folded the laundry and three nails on my non-dominant hand had the polish chipped off halfway down the nail! 50% of the nail was uncovered! From folding soft fluffy towels! I had to write a review to warn others. A coworker recommended something called Pro FX Complete 3. It's a base coat, strengthener, and top coat in one. It's been working great so far. Also, Revlon Color Stay Top Coat works pretty well too. Would give this Sally Hansen Acrylic Top Coat zero stars if I could. I generally like their products, too."
2674,Optimum Nutrition Flaxseed Oil,0/0,5.0,"I haven't seen any amazing results from this product, but I have no complaints.It's great to be taking Omega vitamins without the fishy burps."
2675,"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",0/0,5.0,This is the greatest thing for kids. Very well made product. Very easy to set up. The nephews just love taking turns sleeping on it. Well worth the money.
2676,Bakery On Main Nutty Cranberry Granola Gluten Free ( 6x12 OZ),0/0,5.0,I have been using this product since diagnosed with celiac disease several years ago. My wife found it online and it is the best tasting granola I have found. Thank you Bakery on Main.
2677,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,1.0,"I've used frontline on my cats for years and it works great!!!! As far as where I ordered from on this site another story!!!! Ive order from amazon before just not this particular place and its come new in the box correct dosing!! So take notice on the box you see in the picture is says either 3 or 6 applicators.This is either 3 or 6 doses (full doses) if you received a vile and syringe you have been scammed! I ordered from ALL ANIMAL FLORIDA ALLIANCE through amazon here and have been battling trying to get my money back.They are saying its brand new (which should be in the box shown) 6 doses +2 bonus doses making 8 doses. Well I got 1 applicator that you see on the box which they are saying in one email to me is 6 doses in another email its 8 doses..so which is it??? My vet has given this to me and each is a single dose so in the end the sent me 1 applicator (1 dose) for the price of 6 doses. Also it was mailed to me in a manila folder with no instructions, a vile and syringe. No return slip and expecting me to pay to return. The address they gave me to return is an apartment complex in Florida (I googled the address) not to the animal shelter which would be a business.The phone numbers on their ""facebook and website pages"" are not valid numbers. Everyone just be aware if you order from this animal shelter as I do not think the are valid and are scamming people. Otherwise order this product elsewhere b/c it does work great for cats/dogs."
2678,Medela Swing Breast Pump,0/0,5.0,"I have a Medela manual pump that I got from the hospital, it hurts! I was then turned off from pumping however with my second baby, I decided to try an electric pump and I am so glad I did! I read many many reviews and decided to pay a bit extra for this pump because of all the positive reviews. The instructions are easy to follow and it is not noisy. I pumped with my two babies fast asleep next to me. I am relieved to have found this pump so now hubby and I can have a life again!"
2679,Buffalo Games Disney Photomosaic The Lion King 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"This puzzle is very challenging, but it was very fun to do. I wouldn't recommend this to smaller kids, or even early teens as i'm sure they will be frustrated quickly. It isn't cheap, it has long been out of print. If you are a BIG fan of TLK, i recommend this. It took me almost a year to track down this puzzle! If you are buying online, make sure to ask the seller if all pieces are accounted for (if you plan to frame it like i did). It is proudly displayed on my wall :)"
2680,"Luna Bars, 1.69-Ounce Bars",1/3,1.0,"Wondering why these are still listed as 'in stock', when they are NOT in stock and, in fact, no longer being made by Clif/Luna??"
2681,Spiru-Tein (Spirutein) Sport Shake - Vanilla - 2.3 Lb. - Powder,0/0,5.0,"tastes so much better than other protein supplements. And has much higher quality ingredients! So good. I recommend the vanilla flavor over the Chocolate, but both are awesome."
2682,"Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Summer Strawberry, 0.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 30)",0/0,1.0,I received my item on time but once I opened it the bars were brown and uneatable. I would not recommend this this item to anyone.
2683,Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper,0/0,5.0,Read athese in a magazine review. Great clippers with instructions on how to best cut your nails. Will probably never need to buy another pair. Cuts tough toenails with ease.
2684,GiGi Natural Muslin Strips,0/0,4.0,This is nicely cut etc but using brown cotton cut down to size is a lot cheaper as well as better! I would recommend this if you do not have time to cut ure own!
2685,Sea Sponge Tampon,0/0,5.0,"I have been using these for a few years now and they are amazing. Easy to insert, easy to remove, and I have never had one leak. They are by far the most comfortable tampon you can use."
2686,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,0/0,4.0,This stethoscope works pretty good. I used it for 2 years as a medical assistant. Since I am no longer practicing due to medical reasons it mostly just hangs around. However I did use it this morning to listen to my sons lungs.....still works great.
2687,"Clevercat Jumbo Liners for Clevercat Top Entry Litter Box, 10-Pack",0/0,1.0,Others have said it well
2688,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"The banana flavor is amazing, and its working very well for me. I plan on looking into some casein by ON soon."
2689,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,1/3,1.0,Expected quality from Wahl...but got junk with no quality control. One of the screws holding the cutting blade in place was completely stripped out and now the blade is held in place by only one screw. Looks like I'm the one screwed on this deal. Will be the last Wahl I purchase (have owned three others). Inspect upon arrival to verify that it isn't junk.
2690,"76"" x 47"" Whale Ride on",0/2,1.0,"This is HUGE! It is very back heavy as the front is high. More important...It is BLACK. In the hot sun, the orca turns into a dangerous animal, scalding to the touch and completely unusable. It is very well made however!"
2691,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"Mixes well, taste great! I would buy it again for sure. Maybe the bigger size next time though. Cheaper then buying it on all other websites I could find!"
2692,InuYasha InuYasha 8-Inch Plush,0/0,5.0,I am a huge Inuyasha fan. This is a great plushie to own. Absolutely love it!!! I would highly recommend this one to anyone as long as you can get it in good condition.
2693,H2O+ Oasis 24 Hydrating Booster,0/0,5.0,I like it so much.i have been using for more than 5years and will more and more year.H2O is the best
2694,Curious George Tin Kaleidoscope - only one included,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my 19 month baby and he loves it. The kaleidoscope has a prettily painted tin exterior and nice bright beads inside. The base is made of plastic, not glass, so it doesn't break when dropped repeatedly on a tile floor. The painted tin has not scratched or dented. It has not succumbed to any amount of twisting or other types of toddler abuse. A fun toy for any die hard Curious George fan."
2695,Perfecto Recessed Aquarium Hood 24in Oak,0/0,2.0,"Please put name as Perfecto Recessed Aquarium Hood 23 *11 in oak , Now i am back to square one, no hood for my 24 aquarium"
2696,Duro-Med 14 Molded Foam Ring Cushion,1/1,5.0,The product arrived quicker than I expected. It is of a very quality. I like that the cover is removable and washable. It is very comfortable.
2697,Beetle Juice (1988),0/0,5.0,Early Alec Baldwin before his head literally got bigger. Fun effects and goofy characters. Great dance number but Michael Keaton really steals the show.
2698,Black & Decker (1) Glass & Jar Cleaner-Long Scrubbing Brush Part No. PKS-GB,0/0,5.0,"I love this brush attachment for the Black & Decker Scrubbing Brush as it does a terrific job of scrubbing out the interior of glasses or coffee cups. To help clean things out, I add just a drop or two of dish washing soap, a smidge of water, and then I use the brush attachment. My glassware and coffee cups are cleaned up quickly using this nifty tool.Highly recommend."
2699,Garam Masala Spice Blend 2.0 oz - Zamouri Spices,1/1,5.0,I couldn't find this at my grocery store and the specialty stores that did carry it were way expensive. This tastes great and is a wonderful price.
2700,SALUX Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash cloth Towel Yellow,0/0,5.0,Perfect. Also great for cleaning bathrooms and other tough jobs. Machine washable and lasts forever. Nice to have a couple of them.
2701,"Now Foods, Sweet Almond Oil",0/0,5.0,"First of all this product can be used everywhere; on your hair, hands, feet, body, and probably in a skillet! I love the consistency most of all. A little goes a long way and there is no oily finish. If it is used to moisturize the body you feel very smooth and need little to no more after the first use. Also if it is used in hair it stays for a few days and slowly sinks in. The oil is even better when mixed with other oils such as olive and jojoba.Best time to use it would be after a refreshing shower! Bottom line"
2702,Opi Nail Polish - Mrs O'leary's Bbq #W44,0/0,2.0,The color looks different on line. It appears to be a deep brown. You need to apply two coats for it to look decent. Drying time is not to bad. It dries to a smooth finish. This nail polish is really thick. The application is not very easy because of it's thickness. I was hoping the color would be as pretty as it looked on line. I would not order this color again.

2704,Biotone Dual Purpose Creme,0/0,5.0,"Smooth, light fragrance, non-greasyLike to use as moisturizer and massage cream. Very nice texture and scent . I like it."
2705,Clearblue Fertility Monitor 1 Count,2/2,5.0,"I lost my first child at 32 weeks. He was born sleeping. I knew right away I wanted to try again. I bought this because I read so many remarkable reviews. And the site where I chart shows great results with people who use this. First month using it and I'm now pregnant with my rainbow baby!!! I thought I wouldn't get a peak on the first cycle but I did!I can't believe it. I never imagined that I would be one of the ones who got pregnant first cycle using CB Fertility Monitor. Now I just hope it sticks. Whatever happens will happen, but I have complete confidence in this device and will definitely use it for my future planned pregnancies.Worth the money spent!!"
2706,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,0/0,5.0,"This is a little heavier than I had expected... but I still love it! You should definitely get it, you'll love it too."
2707,Sight Words-Level 1,0/0,5.0,These cards are great!! They are step one for the site words that every child should know. The box and cards are very well made and sturdy. I think these will last for a long time!!
2708,AquaClear 110 Ammonia Remover Insert - 19.7 Ounces,0/0,5.0,This is a great product. Be sure to buy the one that looks like little pebbles of sand as it work better than the one with larger pieces and usually comes with the product divided into 2 bags.
2709,Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa,1/1,4.0,This product is a very good one. I LOVE anything mint chocolate and this meets my expectations. It is very smooth tasting and with the long shelf life of the package deal I can enjoy it year round! Everyone who enjoys mint chocolate should do themselves a favor and try this!
2710,Life-Flo Estrocare,1/1,5.0,First of all... I am Robert's wife (just to clarify this isn't a male) I started using this after some pretty intense hot moments during the day and sleepless nights. I had both symptoms of menopause in a big way. I started using the cream 2x a day and also supplemented with another product. It's been about a month and a half and all symptoms have all but stopped. I do have the occasional hot moment but they seem to occur more with my emotionally reactions and I peacefully sleep through the night nowadays!Side-note
2711,"Yeowww Catnip Bags, 1-Ounce",0/0,3.0,"From the description, I thought my catnip-loving cats would take to it quickly. Not so. They may just be used to the old catnip I'd been getting for them. Not bad, though. The cats eventually took to it, but not very enthusiastically"
2712,The First Years Hands Free Gate Extension,0/0,5.0,"This extension fit our first years hands free gate perfectly. I was concerned that adding an extension would make the gate more wobbly, but once it is clipped in it is just as sturdy as the original gate by itself."
2713,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,This collar is still able to fit on my 8 lbs. poodle (it's a little bulky but it doesn't seem to bother her.) It surprises her instead of hurting her and it stops her barking immediately. There's no reason to buy a shock collar with this on the market!
2714,Jobst For Men 8-15 mmHg Over-The-Calf Sock - in your choice of size and color,0/0,5.0,Very good socks.....had to cut out toes because of sweating of toe areas......still worked for support of veins in legs......
2715,Boudreaux's Butt Paste 16 oz. Jar,0/0,5.0,"I recently had a bad allergic reaction on my leg to the plants in the back yard. The dermatologist was out of the aluminum acetate solution he usually uses for this type of allergic reaction (so I bought some from Amazon, but that is a different review) and instead he wrapped my leg with a bandage that was coated with a white paste. It worked great at reducing the irritation on my leg (a lot) so I researched it and found that it was 10% Zinc Oxide cream. My friend (a mother) told me, upon hearing my story) that she has used zinc oxide paste for her babies and they never got diaper rash. So I ordered Boudreaux's Butt Paste and found that it worked so well, that my sin started healing better. I wrapped my leg in gauze after I coated the affected area with Boudreaux's Butt Paste and sleep like a baby (yes, I had to use aluminum acetate eventually, but the Boudreaux's Butt Paste allowed me to get better while I was waiting for the aluminum acetate to be shipped to me. I like Boudreaux's Butt Paste 16 oz. Jar so much that I purchased an extra jar and put it in my first aid kit next to the aluminum acetate."
2716,"Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue",2/2,4.0,I did not receive the same model number as described in the product description. I received the RV-7497 which does not have an ION on/off switch with light. It does have the ION technology and am happy with it. I purchased this as a replacement for the same brand/styler which wore out after several years of daily use. I believe this is a newer model than the one shown in the product description as the one I had purchased several years ago was the model with the ION switch. This is the best of the hot air styling brushes I have tried and it is a good value. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com after not being able to find it at my local retailer. I deducted one star from my rating because it is a bit louder than I would like it to be. Since you have to hold it closer to your head than a regular hair dryer and especially when you are holding it near the ear....it would be nice if they could reduce the sound.
2717,Simple Solution Spot Spotter Ultraviolet Urine Detector,1/1,3.0,"Suggest going to Home Depot and getting a standard lightbulb UV light such as the Philips Party & Deco Blacklight A19 75 Watt. Costs less than $4.00 and screws into any light fixture - something with a reflector works best and protects your eyes. I'm guessing it works better than something battery powered. Still it's necessary to get close - 12"" - 24"". The spots seem to show pretty clearly."
2718,BD BD Magni-Guide,0/0,4.0,This is helpful for my parents who need to see the dosage better on my son's syringes. It has been benefical to them.
2719,BonaKemi AT0002424 Microfiber Applicator Pad,0/0,5.0,I used it with the 2 Pack Pro Shot floor Restorer and wow it looks brand new! I had another one and it didnt do as good as a job as this one did. Will buy more down the road.
2720,Pampers Easy Ups Trainers for Boys,0/0,4.0,This diaper is wonderful as it works the entire night. I was looking for a good diaper which holds and doesn't leak during the night. This is the perfect one.
2721,78007 1/350 USS Enterprise Carrier,0/0,5.0,Gorgeous...hmmm...an odd title for a ship...but it was a beautiful kit and build. Everything you need is there...just take your time in the deatailing to bring it to life. I thought the aircract could have had more detailing...and cutting the wings to fold them over...to replicate deck storage...was a nightmarish procedure. I agree with a previous review...some effort could have been made to replicate the hangar deck...or a portion thereof...because having served on one...a carrier is just not a carrier without it's hangar deck! All in all a very nice kit...large in size...over 39 inches in length! Enjoy!
2722,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,2/4,5.0,"This product is perfect for my thinning hair. Just shake in on, follow with the spray (sold separate), style and go. The color matches perfect. It is easy, I do truly love it."
2723,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,5.0,it is everything that i needed for my puppie she doesnt like it but i love it! came right on time an is a grat product easy easy set up!
2724,100 pcs Fun Ballz,0/0,2.0,"These are very low quality, thin plastic made in China. Not that you should have high hopes for plastic ball-pit balls, but probably 20% of them came out of the package dented. They'll work fine I guess, since the kids don't care if there are dents, but I'm guessing that they won't last very long before they've all been crushed and must be replaced."
2725,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,3.0,Product is awrsome! My dog actually sleeps now! All we had was a towel but now that he is older it was getting uncomfortable for him so we got him this bed an he is much more comfortable! :)

2728,Swiss Kriss by Modern Products - 120 Tablets,1/1,5.0,"Very effective. reasonable price and all natural, by far a good laxative that you do not regret buying it. Also good shipment service."
2729,Chewable Lactase 3500 - 30 - Wafer,0/0,3.0,"i paid for 60 wafers (as shown in the picture) but the smaller bottle of 30 wafers was delivered! Other than that, it is a product that i would buy constantly. How would i get the other 30 wafers?"
2730,MindWare Block Buddies,0/0,4.0,This is a great educational toy for pre-schoolers. I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter. The wood blocks are light weight and brightly colored to get the kids attention. The cue cards have varying levels of difficulty. This certainly helps with children who have never been exposed to patterns before to start with basic cards and gain confidence as they build patterns. My 7 yr old son also had fun finishing all the patterns very quickly until I challenged him to create his own. This is a great gift for under $20.
2731,"SlimFast Shake Mix, 12.83-Ounce (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,Very tasty if you add a fruit with it it makes it even tastier. Easy to fix and very filling.
2732,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,1/1,5.0,"We installed this mirror at the vanity, mostly for a family member who uses a wheelchair. It works great for him, but the rest of us appreciate its versatility too. It's a little stiff to move, but it stays put and doesn't sag."
2733,Tamiya 35219 1/35 US Willys MB Jeep,1/1,5.0,This is a good model. It is a nice representation. A great display piece. I liked the detail. It looks authentic.
2734,Playskool Swing 'N Score Baseball,0/0,5.0,My son was a little young for this when I bought it for him but over the last year he has really learned how to use and enjoy it. He loves the sound effects and lights. It has helped develop his hand eye coordination!
2735,"Petmate Hooded Litter Pan Set Large, Beige/Light Pink",0/0,4.0,"I only gave 4 stars because the lid doesn't catch and latch to stay on so I wouldn't try to ever carry mine by the handle. My cat is pretty petite and it fits her well, if I had a bigger cat I would think it might be bordering on being too small. The colors are pleasing though and the litter pan is nice and deep and obviously it functions and serves its purpose."
2736,Soothe & Cool No Rinse Perineal Spray,2/2,5.0,I was traveling with my dear mother who has serious bowel incontinence. The inevitable happened at a fast food place that had inadequate bathroom facilities. The &#34;baby wipes&#34; I tried to use were totally ineffective until I put a couple squirts of this perineal wash on them. It removed the nasty odor and the sticky residue quickly and completely. I now keep a bottle in each bathroom and travel bag as well as having a supply available for &#34;bed baths&#34;.Just don't spray it directly on a person as they may find it shockingly cold.
2737,Quickie Original Flexible Static Duster,2/2,4.0,"I am the owner of a cleaning business. We use ONLY these types of dusters for high areas. We go through a ton of them every year. It has a been a true hassle trying to find these. All stores including Wal Mart and Target have stopped selling these types. The wool ones that EVERY one seems to have are useless to us. They mat up and become extremely dirty. These static dusters are the BEST product. They collect cobwebs and dust in areas we cannot reach. When they start to get dirty all we have to do is vacuum them off and it's like new.We love these dusters. The only complaint I do have and the only reason that we go through so many is the fact they after using them ALL day EVERY day, the wire gets weak and ends up breaking the duster in half. Remember we are a cleaning business. No product is designed to be used the way we use them. So for the average home owner I'm sure they would last a lifetime.Please do not stop selling these. Thank you for being almost the ONLY ones that carry them. It's getting harder and harder to find these. If every one stops carrying them we might as well go out of business because this is the only one that serves a purpose for us.I gave it 4 stars ONLY because these are a little shorter than what we are used to. But the handle is a little longer so it evens out.Thank you again!!"
2738,Remington Orange Reflective Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,"I have a black dog and am always worried about her getting loose for a second and someone not seeing her. This collar is visible for a long way off, and it is made very well. I have been using this brand of collar for years, and will continue to buy them when my dog's wears out."
2739,"PayDay Peanut Caramel Candy Bar, 3.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)",0/0,5.0,IF YOU LOVE AN ABUNDANCE OF PEANUTS AND CARAMEL THEN THIS IS THE BAR FOR YOU. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THIS LISTING ON AMAZON TO BE HONEST. I JUST HAD TO PURCHASE FOR MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT. PEACE.
2740,"Alex 36"" X 36"" Vinyl Padded Playmat",0/0,4.0,"I bought this mat for my nephews and they LOVE it. It's loads of fun for kids & practical for parents, as they can easily fold it up and carry a few cars or whatever in it. Great buy."
2741,PediFix Wart STICK,1/1,5.0,a great way to apply just the amount you need just where you need it. We had to use a small applicator to target the wart and miss surrounding skin. The wax base is good to keep it in place. We covered the plantar wart afterwards with gauze and tape to protect and keep the product in place.
2742,Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush,0/0,4.0,"Love the sonicare toothbrush. This is a pretty basic model. I miss the 30 sec timer, but its not a huge deal."
2743,"Devcon S31 Clear 2-Ton Epoxy, 1 oz Tube",1/1,4.0,I bought this to attach new handles to a knife. The 30 minute working time was just what I needed.
2744,Elenco 1% 1 Watt Resistor Substitution Box,0/0,4.0,"Great little box use it all the time for testing, a good unit fun the hobbyist, and fun kit to build."
2745,"Now Foods, L-Glutamine 1500 mg",0/0,5.0,"Short and sweet. We have been using this powder for at least 10 years in our smoothies and find it easy to mix, tasteless and healthful. It works for my husband who needs extra amino acids in his system as he is a car accident victim and has many internal problems. I find it very helpful for me. Makes me feel better all around. It's clean and easy to dissolve in the smoothies. I recommend it over capsules or pills as it goes right into the your system."
2746,Tricep Rope,0/0,5.0,"I just buy everything from Amazon anymore. I cant say enough. About the rope? This was $6 cheaper than my local sporting good store and yes, its everything you would expect in a thick piece of rope with hand-stops. Ok, it does have a great feel, and the hand stops are never coming off from the looks of it; but at the end of the day its rope. What can I say about Amazon? I got this in two days, saved money and felt stupid for even price shopping the thing. I wasted money on gas. I am just going to buy stuff from Amazon without price shopping anymore. I just got some desk hardware, foam brushes and wood stain I needed just now. No price shopping. Yay Amazon!"
2747,Majestic Pet- Super Value Pet Bed - Large,2/2,5.0,"We love it. Way better then we expected! It's so fluffy an comfortable I would sleep on it ! We have full grown male boxer and he sprawls out on it and still had room. the material seems like it would be easy to clean but we haven't had to clean it yet so we will see . Very satisfied, good product , great price and It arrived quicker then expected !"
2748,Dulcolax Stool Softener Liquid Gels,2/2,4.0,"I chose this product because it doesent make you go (non-laxative) but rather allows you to go easier. I can't say that my symptoms are completely gone but I must admit that it has improved to the point that I am not afraid to go any more. It is as advertised, I would recommend it to a friend and you can't beat the price at Amazon. Thank -you - very- much!!!"
2749,Bauerfeind Achillo Train Pro Achilles Tendon Support,1/1,5.0,"This German-made support may be pricy, but it absolutely delivers what it promises. I've been using it for occasions when my tendon is sore, but not disfunctional. This support enables me to play hours of soccer without further damaging or straining a tender tendon. Worth its weight in newly-found plying time!"
2750,PetSafe Pet Door Replacement Flap,0/0,5.0,Easy to install. My second one to purchase. Easy to wipe clean. Like the dark smokey color. Would definetely recommend.
2751,Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball,0/0,5.0,Our lab eats all his meals with this. Unlike hard treat toys it doesn't make an insane racket that drives everyone in the house nuts. The dog loves it too.
2752,"Bio-Groom Bio-Med Dog Shampoo, 8-Ounce",0/0,4.0,"This is a good product if you pet has skin issues of any sort, especially dry or sensitive skin. It is a little pricy, but I like the fact that it uses a sulfur compound instead of pharmaceuticals, and seems to be more natural. It will tend to dry out sensitive skin, so a follow-up shampoo with baby shampoo or a good cream rinse is helpful. It does control itching and scratching with my pet who has short hair and sensitive skin. The price at Amazon beats the prices at local pet supply stores."
2753,Melissa & Doug Pets Wooden Chunky Puzzle,0/0,5.0,I really like the animals on this puzzle. A great learning toy! Youn children are able to do this puzzle by themselves- and it is very satisfying for them.

2755,American Crew Hold Styling Gel (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"Great hold, doesn't fake and it smells good, but not too strong of as scent. I use it almost everyday."
2756,Roland All Natural Hot Wasabi Coated Green Peas - 4.40 oz,0/0,1.0,"The peas are stale in taste and in color while the wasabi coating, though it does taste a bit like wasabi, lacks the hot punch."
2757,Prince Lionheart Ever-Fresh Replacement Pillows for Ultimate Wipes Warmer,0/0,5.0,"I really wanted to not use these things. I bought thePrince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmerand it came with a pack of these. Once they got old and I tossed them, I really didn't want to have to buy new ones. I tried using diaper inserts, cloth diapers, wipes, etc. but nothing worked to keep away mildew in the warmer. So, I bought a refill pack and I have to say, these things really work! Ever since I started using these in the bottom of my wipe warmer, I've had no mildew and no weird smell to my wipes. I gotta say, these things definitely do what they're supposed to do!"
2758,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,1/1,1.0,1. This item is the size of a field mouse2. My Beagle had it ripped apart in less then 5 minutes.

2760,Nexxus Simply Silver Colour Toning Shampoo (Platinum Pro) 10.1 oz.,0/0,3.0,I was trying to get my gray hair to look more white and radiant; but they turned kind of blue.
2761,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/1,1.0,"Something in the product's fragrance profile resembled vomit to me, to the extent that I became nauseated while using the soap for laundry. I generally love rose-scented products. As this was a very unpleasant experience, hopefully I am the only person who will have this experience. Also when I used it in cold water, the soap solidified on clothes. I am looking forward to trying the unscented version, for hot & warm washes."
2762,Natural Grass Sea Sponges,0/0,5.0,"This is a great sponge. Most of the others are small, undersized, and whimpy. I got this one quick and it's big enough to split it and make Two!! I cut one piece off for a face sponge and was left with a big one for the bath."
2763,Palmers Shea Butter Lotion Pump Bottle 13.5 Oz,0/0,3.0,"I ordered this for a massage CEU class, which required Shea Butter for a portion of the class. This is *not* straight Shea and if you need pure Shea, this will not do you a lick of good.So, I decided to try it as a cream for my arms, just to test it out. The Palmer's formulation actually felt like it burned my skin, which can happen when you are too sensitive.After years of testing different brands, I still think that the best sensitive skin lotion I have found is the Curel Ultra Healing Lotion (red banner on front)Curel Ultra Healing Lotion, 20 Ounce. Just note that it is not a Shea product.If you need to purchase a straight Shea Butter, I can suggest the ""NOW"" brandNOW Foods Shea Butter, 7-Ounceor something which is pure. I ended up picking up the NOW brand at my local Whole Foods. It comes in a small open mouth tub and worked wonderfully."
2764,Guardian Padded Drop-Arm Commode,1/1,5.0,"My wife recently had surgery that will leave her mostly in bed for three months. We bought this commode to provide a bedside convenience. This device has fulfilled its function superbly. We station the commode by her bedside and drop down the arm nearest the bed so she can get onto the seat with minimum assistance. The padded seat is much more comfortable than the hard surface of the hospital portable commode. This commode is sturdy, easy to empty, and easy to clean. It was easy to assemble. I would definitely buy this product again!"
2765,"All-Glass Aquarium Black 24"" Fluorescent Strip Lite",1/1,1.0,"Like the previous reviewer, I am disappointed that the fixture didn't last longer. I will look elsewhere for the replacement."
2766,"Vibratex Water Dancer Pocket Massager, Blue",0/0,5.0,I had one of these before but it gave up on me so now I am purchasing a second. It gives a lot of bang for your buck. You do need to use quite a few batteries but its devine!
2767,Now Foods Optimum Digestive System,1/1,5.0,I've tried one other digestive enzyme containing similar ingredients and I would say that NOW Foods' enzymes help me digest food. I use these when I stray from a good diet; I'll probably buy these again
2768,Zippo Wolf Black Ice Pocket Lighter,0/0,4.0,"It is a great lighter. When lit, the flame reaches good hight. If you like or love wolves, I would highly recommend it to you."

2770,Quantum Research Canker Cover Oral Canker Sore Patch,0/0,4.0,This product works good. It does heal up canker sores quickly but is a little uncomfortable when using. It is best to apply right before bed time that way when you are sleeping it does the healing and you don't feel the discomfort so much.
2771,"Cadet Chicken Breast Fillets, 32-Ounce",0/0,5.0,My dog loves these treats. They are big meaty pieces. They are her favorite treat after walks & before bedtime. The price is good for the product received.

While it should also be noted that it's America's Only Pumpkin, it sure is good.Here's my pumpkin bread recipe. Please note that you shouldn't eat both loaves in one sitting.

2773,Fenugreek Seeds 620 mg By Solaray - 100 Capsules,0/0,5.0,My wife reviewed this product:I use this product daily since I am nursing since I had low-supply issues in the past. It doesn't seem to cause gassiness or fussiness in my child. I pump at work and notice my supply does drop if I do not take the supplement for a day or two.
2774,"NorthShore Premium Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Large Size 23 x 36, Pk/25",0/0,5.0,"I ordered these because someone on the review page warned me away from another distributor (thank you sir) they arrived very fast and when I opened the box I knew I had one problem solved. I use them for a Chinese Crested who doesn't understand why he has to go outside in the freezing cold, rain, wind, or he doesn't feel like it. So pooping is fine just outside the door, but peeing is best if done in the house. On these pads. There's room for Mr. 9 pounds of terror so that he doesn't get his feet smelly (this is the same dog who runs to the bathroom after coming in from outside because he doesn't feel ""fresh"" to be cleaned. Just in case.) So these pads are a joy. The padding is absorbent and even (no gaping holes and empty spots) They don't carry urine to be siphoned onto the floor and the size 23 X 36 is perfect. I wouldn't change companies for anything. NorthShore has my vote all the way."
2775,Pioneer Custom DIY Play Set Hardware Kit,1/1,5.0,This came to us as described. It came with all the pieces and undamaged. Arrived very fast with directions on what needed to be purchased to complete this swing set.
2776,glominerals glominerals gloPressed Base -.35 fl oz,0/0,2.0,"I love glominerals makeup but I'm not sure what's up with some products that come from unapproved vendors. Of course, glominerals warns the public against ordering from unauthorized places, for various reasons that you can look on their website, but I took a chance because I was in a bind and needed some quickly (thanks Amazon for that). With this specific experience, after the third day, I opened the compact to see that all the pressed base was a crumbly mess. Fortunately, I had a backup mineral foundation container that I was able to pour it all in to. Whew! Lost a little in the process but at least it wasn't a total loss. I still love, love, love glominerals pressed base but something is honestly up with this product that was supplied by an unauthorized vendor. Can't put my finger on it but this was a lesson learned."
2777,Boon Flo Water Deflector and Protective Faucet Cover with Bubble Bath Dispenser,0/0,3.0,"Since we don't have a shower pull on our faucet, it's very easy for our daughter to pull the cover off the faucet. Not sure I would buy this again."

2781,WeatherTech Tubular Pet Barrier,0/0,4.0,"I recently purchased this item for the purpose of transporting a dog I adopted. I have used other barriers without much success. I drive a Dodge Journey, and decided to view Dodge's website first to see what they recommend. The WeatherTech 60010 is the one they have listed.I absolutely hate putting furniture, etc. together...seems like anything you buy these days has to be assembled. This item was a piece of cake. I thought the directions were straightforward and I had it set up and secured in the back of my car in no time.My dog (80 lb. Rott) tested it, but didn't seem interested in trying to get out, therefore I don't know how the barrier would hold up with a more determined dog...that would be my other dog, and I haven't tried him yet. Also, the barrier is blissfully quiet."
2782,"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory",0/0,2.0,"I thought this tray would be the perfect accessory to my bumbo seat... Although it is nice for my baby to have a tray to play with his toys on or eat snacks on, I would not have purchased this knowing what I know now.Pros:*I like the fact I have the option to have a tray on my bumbo seat for my babies activities*It's plastic, so it's easy to clean*It's hard & Durable and not easy to breakCons:*The price they charge for this cheap piece of plastic is not worth it's value*It's difficult to attach to the bumbo seat... The top part attaches to the piece in between the babies legs , and there's a hook that latches to the bottom of the seat to secure it in place. You literally have to squish the seat to get the bottom latch on. Therefore, cannot do it while baby is in the seat. This is a problem since it's very difficult to get baby in the seat while the tray is attached, especially now that they have the safety belt. You need tiny hands to squeeze in between your baby and the seat belts with the tray in the way in order to buckle him in. It's just not worth the hastle..."
2783,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,0/0,2.0,"I purchased my first Drinkwell Fountain over ten years ago. It worked perfectly every day until it finally died several weeks ago,I believed in the product, my cats loved it so i didn't consider another brand. I did take very good care of the fountain, taking it apart and washing it in hot water weekly.I ordered the exact fountain I had. I set it up and within a day I realized it was leaking. I checked all the parts filled it up and set it on my kitchen counter, it leaked. I was sure it was the result of damage in shipping so I sent it back and immediately ordered another one.Second Fountain comes and no leaks. I'm happy my cats are happy, all is well...not so fast. It's been a couple of weeks and yesterday I found it was leaking, badly. This time I wasn't checking it so I have some floor damage, fortunately not very much and that's not really the issue for me. I'm sending back the unit but now my cats do not have a fountain. I have some unhappy little furs. They have bowls of fresh water but have always gone to the fountain first.I'll go out and look for another brand but frankly I really liked the Drinkwell and I'm so sorry I wont have one."
2784,"Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce",1/1,3.0,"I say for the price this is a good product. I lathers really well, so much that I can get a second lathering for a second pass. This cream is far superior to any of that crap that squirts out of a can.The scent is a bit strong for my taste, more especially if you are going to use an aftershave or cologne of a different fragrance. As a stand alone scent it's good.The 13.00 purchase should last me 1-2 years so I feel it is a good buy and worth the money.Brian V."
2785,Chlor-Trimeton Chlor-Trimeton 4 Hour Allergy Relief Tablets,0/0,5.0,"I have used this product for years and have discovered that taking the 4 hour tabs every 3 hours works best for me. The 4 hour as well as 12 hour tabs are VERY hard to find in the Phoenix metro area, so now I am forced to buy it online and keep a stock pile.I take this product with Tropicana Pure Premium OJ (some/medium pulp).Take a tab before bed and have a box of tissue and waste basket nearby. You will feel it kick in and the start with moderate sinus drainage and sneezing. Once you have taken about 3 tabs (in sequence) you will feel MUCH better and both sneezing and drainage will stop."
2786,Animals on the Farm 24 Piece Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle,2/2,1.0,"This is a cute puzzle, but unfortunately, the pieces are falling apart quickly. When it says 'solid wood', each piece is really several very thin layers of wood glued together. When assembled, the pieces fit very tightly together so that just separating them is enough to delaminate the layers, especially the top layer which has the paper picture glued to it. This started happening the first few times we played with it."
2787,ARMANI CODE by Giorgio Armani for MEN,0/0,5.0,"Awesome fragance I loved it and everybody around me like it too. It's perfect to go out at night, 100% recommended"
2788,"Flexi Retractable All Belt Lead, 16ft",0/0,5.0,"I love this leash, I really do. Works great so far. However, I bought this online, then found it at my local retail store that starts with a big &#34;W&#34; and has a star in the middle for a couple dollars cheaper. I was just a little bit devastated. So, you might try there first on your next shopping trip."

2792,Everholder FURemover Broom,2/2,5.0,"This works as promised. It's also really great for &#34;scooping up&#34; my daughter's very long hair from her bedroom carpet before I vacuum her room. Otherwise, her hair gets caught in the roller bar of my vacuum, and it's pretty hard to get out."
2793,POOF-Slinky 8701 Slinky Science Young Architect Building Set,6/8,5.0,"The real genius of this product is not in its enabling of creativity, but rather in its harsh but appropriate delivery of the all too accurate perpetual disappointment and frustration of contemporary architectural practice. Impossible to get large plastic panels to appear flat? Sounds about right. Corners not really staying together no matter how many times you cloud and note the shop drawings? Been there, done that. Fingerprints and glue on the glass!? GRRRRRR!This product is hard to use, but necessarily so. I hope every young person who uses it experiences the titillating anticipation of realizing environments catalyzed in their minds' eye, and also the begrudging difficulty of accepting only a dilute approximation of their expectations. I suggest a parent follow this product with an educational copy of 3D modeling software, or a visit to digital fabrication facilities, to give them, along with their dose of reality, a taste for what can be possible, an appetite for change in a practice that has been made laughable by its stubborn adherence to ancient techniques, and constant disconnection from its practical and ideological relevance, into a cave of aesthetic conundrum."
2794,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,This was exactly what I was hoping for. I was looking for tea with raspberry leaves only for the ingredients. Arrived on time and tasted good.
2795,Nature's Way Echinacea Root Complex,1/1,4.0,It's a good product if your concerned about being healthy with natural supplements. The amount needed to take per day is a little tedious.

When I went to sleep, I have set it up, and....OMG...for the first time in my life, while pregnant, I slept without waking up, and in the morning i had no back pain! I want to mention that I also have 2 herniated discs, which since I got pregnant have bothered me. The area where you put your neck, I read reviews that lot of ladies out there found it uncomfortable. Not for me. At first, yes, it felt like a sharp edge, but I lift up the pillow a little bit higher, and....nothing no more, just perfect. Also I want to say that it is a pretty good size pillow, considering that I am 6'1"" tall.Overall, I love the pillow. If something changes, I will keep you all updated. Thank for reading my review."
2805,Natural Chewable Prenatal Vitamins 200 Count,0/0,5.0,"I think this is a really good chewable prenatal vitamin. I am unable to swallow pills so these were perfect. The taste is pretty icky, but I found if I chewed them with an acidopholis vitamin (which is overly sweet), the combined taste is really good. Even alone, the bad taste is a small trade off for a healthy vitamin that I can take without having to struggle to swallow. And really, the taste isn't ""that"" bad. It is bearable. I will be using them for the fourth time this year and have had healthy babies each time."
2806,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,0/0,5.0,I originally was looking for the philosophy purity oil free facial cleanser but found this one and thought I'd give it a try.

2809,FunFresh Foods Red Rooibos Moon Tea Berry,0/0,4.0,"I like this tea and the fact that you get 35 bags. I just wish that it still came in a bundle of three at a discounted price. I'm not much of a tea snob, partly because I love lemon and honey in my tea, and I also put in a bag of this tea with another flavored red tea bag. I love strong tea (unless it's white tea-it can have a bitter aftertaste if it's too strong/steeped too long, this can also be a bit of a problem with green tea, but not to the same degree as with white tea)."
2810,Multipet Look Who's Talking Monkey Dog Toy,0/0,2.0,"It scared my dog, it is hard and the sound is more like a shriek than a cute monkey sound. Not great for small dogs."
2811,North States Supergate Extra Wide Gate,0/0,4.0,"The Gate that was pictured was not the gate I received.I found that the Picture belongs to a different Gate.. I had ordered 2 at different times but same gate. the 2nd time I got the gate, but not the mounting brackets.. not sure if I needed to order them seperate or not.. I did get them with the first ordered gate..the North states supergate extra wide gate for 34.50 (is what i paid) is not the picture shown.. the Supergate V-22-62 WX 31H gate for 52.47, The Picture there is the gate I received. I assume the pictures were mixed up.. non the less they work just fine.. but Need to order the wall mounting for my last gate I ordered.. all in all very sturdy and built well. priced to sell and no other complaints. works great for us.."
2812,Contech 300000408 WaterDog Automatic Outdoor Pet Drinking Fountain,0/0,2.0,"It runs when nothing is near it and then not run when she wants a drink. Its a good thing, but needs to have a senser that is more direct and not cover the wide range it does."

It is a bit expensive for the amount of product, but if you use it sparely, ""Mom"" says it is well worth it."
2820,JOVAN MUSK For Women By COTY Cologne Spray,0/0,3.0,"I had no idea what this smelled like. I bought it just hoping it would smell nice. I was just satisfied with it. It is not the best and I would not buy it again, however it is not that bad where I won't use it. I do use it and plan to use the whole bottle. Not a bad price either."
2821,"Power Crunch Peanut Butter Fudge Butter Fudge, 1.4-Ounce Bar (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,These taste great; however I don't feel it satisfies hunger as much as other protein bars but I really like the taste and texture.

2829,Logona Natural Body Care Herbal Hair Color Powders,3/3,1.0,"This in reguards to the Logana ""Henna Black"".The ingredients listed for this product do not indicate that THIS product- ""Henna Black"" - does not contain these ingredients.It lists THIS as the ingredients for Henna Black:Algin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil,* Parfum (Essential Oils), [+/Lawsonia Inermis (Henna)*, Cassia Auriculata (Cassia), Juglans Regia (Walnut Shell Powder), Indigofera Tinctoria (Indigo Leaves), Indigofera Argentea (Indigo Leaves), Hibiscus Sabdariffa (Sudanese Tea), Rheum Undulatum (Rhubarb Root), Krameria Triandra (Rhatany Root), Coffea Arabica (Coffee), Curcuma Longa (Curcuma Root), Beta Vulgaris (Beet Root)]I have used many of these ingredients in their whole form to darken my hair before. So i know that these ingredients will darken my hair naturally. I have bought most of these ingredients on their own and made my own mixtures of them. I was excited to buy this product because it appeared to do all the measuring and mixing for me. With some added hair conditioners.THIS IS NOT WHAT I RECIEVED.The ingredients on this Lagona ""Henna Black"" are :Indigo, Hydrolized wheat protein, Jojoba oil, Algin, Parfum.Thats it.THE ONLY DYING INGREDIENT IS INDIGO. There isnt even any Henna in this formula despite it being named ""Henna"" Black.Indigo is a natural blue/green dye. It will only dye blue and green tints.I can buy indigo on its own for way cheaper than this product.I will not use this alone because used alone it will only impart a blue or green tint to the hair. I will have to now just blend it in with all the other ingredients that SHOULD have been in it because they were LISTED as being in it. So i basically just bought some really expensive indigo.Also- the box states there is only enough for shoulder length hair. Another thing that should be added to the listing.THis was so disapointing and infuriating.Sellers- take freaking care in listing your products so you dont waste everybodies freaking time."

2842,"Max Factor MAXeye Shadows, 0.12-Ounce Packages",0/0,2.0,"I have used this product for over a year and have repurchased several bottles so I feel qualified to write a review. Does it work? eh...only a little. I noticed a slight reduction in ingrown hairs, but nothing to jump up for over joy over. Eventually, I grew tired of spending the money on this and stopped buying. The only thing that has helped with the incessant razor bumps under my arms has been laser hair removal. Though I do notice regrowth of hair, growth is much slower and the hair is much finer so I don't even develop razor bumps anymore because the hair is so fine. And because I don't need to shave as often, I don't experience razor burn. Yes, laser hair removal is expensive, but cheaper than using this product for the rest of my life! In general, I don't recommend this product because it doesn't work well enough to warrant the steep price tag."
2843,Aphogee Keratin Reconstructor,0/0,5.0,"This is my no. 1 hair product. Before discovering this, my hair was so porous, meaning it's loses moisture at a fast rate resulting in really dry hair. This correct my porosity very good. It also adds softness and strength at the same time. I'm relaxed btw. I use it weekly before I deep condition or I add some to my conditioner."

2849,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,2/2,5.0,"My dog wore this all last winter and now he is wearing it this winter too. I wish it were longer. It's silly that they give the length of the coat and not the width. I wish his were longer down his back, but still he loves it.The coat arrived on a tiny hanger. I held it up to show friends, before showing it to the puppy dog, but he was already dancing and jumping because he somehow knew it was HIS. I put it on him and he just pranced all around thrilled to be wearing it.I have washed it many times inside a laundry mesh bag so the velcro doesn't tangle with other clothes. It still looks beautiful. Most days my little pooch has to wear a sweater in the winter, so when it's time to go for our walks, I pop on his coat and he is THRILLED!Everyone comments on the coat, because it is nice looking and not goofy at all. I am so sick and tired of the goofy stuff they make for dogs, I want my doggy to be warm and look nice. He seriously needs the warmth around his heart and lungs. You may need to use it over a sweater too, as the velcro tabs may not cover enough of the dogs heart and lungs.Thank goodness they included a slit in the shoulders for his harness, as it definitely looks cuter with the harness underneath and not on top. I have so many cute pictures of my dog wearing this. Just picking it up, send him dancing and jumping for joy, then he stands real still while I put it on him. Sometimes when we come back home, he runs off with his coat still on, not wanting me to take it off at all, even though I have the heat turned up for him."

2859,Think Fun Math Dice,2/7,5.0,"Well, this dice is to motivate one's thinking and solving in a math. way. Take it as a puzzle game.To me, it is more applicable to kids 4 to 8 years old. Why? A conventional calculator is alwaysavailable for 8-year-old and up to handle. As for adults, they may start entertain younger kidswith this math. game. In reality, there are several ways to learn math. basics outside the schoolclassroom. This happens to be one of those alternatives. Math. is Fun."

2865,Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder,0/0,3.0,Very good and cheap creatine. But lost a star because it doesnt mix well at all with water never tried it with juice because i heard thats a wise tale.
2866,Sof-Seam basic knee support with open patella,0/0,4.0,This brace did its job unfortunately I ordered it too big and it would slide down my leg. The materials were good and if I ordered the right size I'm sure I would have used it more
2867,Coralife Aqualight Dual Linear Strip T5 Aquarium Lighting Fixture,0/0,4.0,"I have used these fixtures in the past with great success, was excited to find one at this price. The first one I received was shattered, leaving glass all over my floor just pulling the coralife box from the shipping box! I returned it for a replacement, which was also shattered. I am going to try one more replacement before giving up."
2868,"Synergy Dental Fresh Dog, 17 Ounce",0/0,5.0,My pug started to have bad smeel in her mouth when my parents gave her meat and some salty food. I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It works perfectly.Mi pug empez&oacute; a tener problemas de mal aliento cuando mis padres le dieron carne y comida de sal. Encontr&eacute; este producto en amazon y decid&iacute; probarlo. Funciona perfectamente.
2869,Medela Quick Clean Breastpump & Accessory Wipes,0/0,3.0,"Ok so you can't just wipe and feed your baby with these you have to wipe then wait at least 10 minutes for it to dry. I personally would not use these wipes and then pump, I would have to wash my pump parts with soap and water. I just us them when I have to pump in the car and need to wipe excess milk off before I get to a sink to wash with soap and water."
2870,Simple Solution Disposable 12 Diapers,0/0,5.0,Love these they work very well. Make sure they are tight enough but not too tight and you will be happy. so will your dog.
2871,"Butterfly Life Cycle Stages Characters, Plastic - 4 Piece Set; no. ILP4760",0/0,5.0,A happy customer in Hawaii! I bought these for my son's preschool for their science table. The kids really enjoyed it.
2872,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,2/2,5.0,"My dog wore this all last winter and now he is wearing it this winter too. I wish it were longer. It's silly that they give the length of the coat and not the width. I wish his were longer down his back, but still he loves it.The coat arrived on a tiny hanger. I held it up to show friends, before showing it to the puppy dog, but he was already dancing and jumping because he somehow knew it was HIS. I put it on him and he just pranced all around thrilled to be wearing it.I have washed it many times inside a laundry mesh bag so the velcro doesn't tangle with other clothes. It still looks beautiful. Most days my little pooch has to wear a sweater in the winter, so when it's time to go for our walks, I pop on his coat and he is THRILLED!Everyone comments on the coat, because it is nice looking and not goofy at all. I am so sick and tired of the goofy stuff they make for dogs, I want my doggy to be warm and look nice. He seriously needs the warmth around his heart and lungs. You may need to use it over a sweater too, as the velcro tabs may not cover enough of the dogs heart and lungs.Thank goodness they included a slit in the shoulders for his harness, as it definitely looks cuter with the harness underneath and not on top. I have so many cute pictures of my dog wearing this. Just picking it up, send him dancing and jumping for joy, then he stands real still while I put it on him. Sometimes when we come back home, he runs off with his coat still on, not wanting me to take it off at all, even though I have the heat turned up for him."
2873,"Jay Robb Enterprises - Whey Vanilla Isolate, 12 oz powder",0/0,5.0,Great flavor and it's sugar free. I use it with almond milk and blend in some almond butter and blueberries for a great pre workout shake.

2879,RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream 0.5 oz (Pack of 2),0/0,5.0,"I find those eye cream very expensive. But my wife love ROC. She had used several other brands before and is now a big fan of this eye cream. I have to agree that the results can be seen. I am starting to use it too.

2882,John Deere Plastic Pedal Tractor,0/0,5.0,"the tractor is nice and sturdy... had a little trouble with the drive chain, but that was more pilot error and anything else. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
2883,Doll Pram In Natural,2/2,5.0,"We bought this stroller 3 years ago for our 1 yr old daughter's birthday. My daughter and son, who is 18 months older, have used the stroller on a daily basis for the last three years. My daughter is now 4 and my son 5. The stroller is used indoor and outdoors. My kids have easily pushed each other in it. When my 50 lb son is in the stroller, my daughter can't push him around corners on the carpet anymore because the the rubber has come off the wheels due to the weight. The rubber easily was put back on and the stroller has been doing fine. The stroller has been a space ship, a rocket launching pad, a doll buggy, a shipping cart, a race car (with or without a child in it), and an all around great toy. It has survived going down a slide at a park and accidental crashes into the wall. There are a few scratches, the rubber is still on the wheels and works great and has withstood the test of 2 children playing with all the time. I highly recommend this stroller and am going to buy it for my niece when she turns 1...despite the price."

2885,"Nutri-Pet Research Nupro Joint Supplement for Dogs, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,"My pomeranian has a loose patella on his back leg (this is where the knee cap dislocates) and arthritis. Prior to giving him this supplement, he would limp from time to time and his back leg and would walk sort of wobbly. This product helped him to move better and he would have less knee cap popping out incidents. I will continue using this on my dog."
2886,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,Seriously...one of the BEST purchase we bought for our kids! We have them in both of our children's rooms. It blocks out all the noise and helps them go to sleep at night. We have had them since their birth. Its just part of their nightly routine to turn on the sound machines. :) we take them everywhere we go. Perfect for hotels! :)
2887,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"I have two dogs, one Saint Bernard and one Husky. I had previously ordered a bed which was listed as ""large,"" and which would have perhaps accommodated half of one of my dogs. This bed is entirely different. Its size allows for both dogs to comfortably lie together, and it has enough thickness so that they aren't simply lying on the floor. Granted, it's only day 2, but they're extremely happy, and so am I."
2888,Siphotrol Plus Area Treatment For Homes-24 oz. spray,0/0,5.0,"I chose this product for its excellence and convenience, and recommend all do the same. Flea control is unfortunately a constant need."

2890,Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce 5oz,0/0,4.0,"Love hot food! The hotter the better and this ghost pepper sauce has a nice flavor. I only use sparingly which ,as my friends will attest to, is a statement in and of itself. Use cautiously and enjoy!"
2891,Coralife 05692 Pure-Flo II 50-Gallon Per Day 4 Stage RO/DI System,0/0,1.0,For the same money you can get a better unit with a TDS meter in it. My unit will not let the membrane seat properly so I can't get the water qualitity that I am suppose to. The hose connections are cheap and the plastic seat connector is quickly wearing out. I see ribbons of plastic come off everytime I disconnect it from the sink.
2892,Punky Color,0/0,5.0,I used so many semi-Blues.... and i prefur this one of all :D Lasts very long as well!!! AND SMELLS LIKE CANDY KOOL-AID :D LOVED it!!!!

2894,Liquid Calcium Magnesium Citrate Plus Vitamin D by Bluebonnet 16 fl. Oz.,0/0,4.0,"This calcium is very tasty and leads one to believe because of the liquid form and the few extra ingredients, that it may be superior. But who know for sure with calcium or any vitamin or mineral. Takes time to know how the body absorbs it and builds bone strength. Kind of expensive though."
2895,1/72 Spad XIII,0/0,5.0,My 9 year old son had a Spad XIII on his Santa list last year. I was pleasantly surprised for the price. It arrived faster than I thought it would and seems to be a good quality. It has been a year and it is still holding up well but it sits on a shelf.
2896,Stomp Rocket Jr. Glow Kit,0/0,5.0,"I got this for my son's 5th birthday the day before Thanksgiving. After dinner on Thanksgiving Day, I took the kids(6 & 5) out to play with it in the all purpose field in our neighborhood. My kids had a blast shooting the rocket then watching to see where it was going to land so they could try to catch it(they never did, but they never stopped trying).Six other kids came over to try it. They all loved it and at least one parent asked me where I found itI would highly recommend this to anyone with kids. Also if you are having a gathering where there will be kids, it would be great to have when you want the kids entertained but not in front of the TV."
2897,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,"Have had this running for a week. Easy to set up. I have it in the main area of the house and I can't hear the motor at all. Occasionally I hear water trickling. Have not had any water splashing at any strength setting, although I normally run it at the slowest setting, but have tested it at all. My cat who likes to drink out of the faucet took to it right away."
2898,Sof'Feet Callus Reducer with Travel Cream & Replacement Screens,0/0,5.0,"seems to do the job. My feet aren't in bad shape, but something comes up, tis will quickly smooth it out without discomfort. Haven't tried the foot cream it comes with."
2899,Kidkraft Nursing Stool,0/0,3.0,"That's the sound this stool makes when you push off the angled position.I chose it for its simple, clean design - and in that regard it doesn't disappoint. But the sound is just downright annoying. I try to keep my feet on the frame of the stool to avoid it. I should stick some of those foam adhesive pads between the top piece and frame to eliminate the noise (Siri, add that to my to-do list).PS> Not sure why this is classified in the toy category? Odd."
2900,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Muy buena fragancia, la recomiendo, el aroma dura bastante tiempo, es un aroma fresco. ideal para cualquier ocasi&oacute;n. Y el precio es muy bueno."

2902,Hyper Dog Ball Launcher,0/0,4.0,"simple principle well executed. Sturdy, and easy to use..I can put the ball exactly where I want it in my sister's yard, or heave it out there on my longer one. I willgive it 5 stars when I see how well it holds up."

2904,Mary Kay Oil Mattifier,0/0,5.0,"I have combination skin that is no fun at all. It's embarrassing how oily my forehead, nose, and chin get after a couple hours. But with this I'm still looking good after several hours. I put on all my skin care products and sunblock, wait till my skins compleatly dry, than take a pea sized amount and gently pat it into my oily zones until the skin under my fingers feels dry again. Than I wait 10 min minimum before I begin applying makeup. Takes a bit of time but so worth it"
2905,Fit & Fresh Lunch On The Go,0/0,4.0,"I bought these to fit in my lunch bag. They are super handy, keep my breakfast and lunch packed in an organized way."
2906,Kyjen Outward Hound Sling-Go Pet Sling Carrier,1/1,1.0,My dog hates this thing. Has no support. I now use it to carry firewood to the house. My dog runs when he sees it.

2908,Jhirmack Silver Brightening Shampoo 20 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"This product works as well as most of the other silver shampoos I've tried. It is definitely better than any of the John Frieda stuff. It doesn't have a dramatic result, but it works pretty well. I will probably buy it again for the value, but if I am willing to spend more I'll go to my Shikai purple shampoo."
2909,OTC Knee Brace with Hinged Bars,0/0,5.0,Had been using velcro type braces. They worked well but through the day the velcro would open up if I moved a certain way. This brace with the straps never moves. It gives you great support and stability that can't be beat. Highly recommend it.
2910,Obagi Foaming Gel Cleanser-6.7 oz,1/1,5.0,"Love this soap....does not burn my eyes nor irritate my skin......very sudsy which I love. Skin does not feel tight after use, but feels clean."
2911,"Hot Tools ""The Shark"" Heated Razor # HTL7071",0/0,5.0,Very nice and does the jobI have used it numerous times when grooming a golden retriever. Does nice job around neck and doesnt look choppy
2912,"Luzianne Chicken Coating Mix, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is a great product for those who like fried chicken but, don't like to pan fry and eat a little healthier, by preparing in the oven. Very good flavor and it's hard to find in most stores."
2913,Aquolina Pink Sugar,1/1,1.0,"(this is for the Hair Pefume)smelled this scent in Sephora months ago and loved it, but I couldn't afford it at the time, so I forgot about it. Then I found it on Amazon and was shocked at how much cheaper it was. I purchased it, and the shipping was fast and the packaging was secure. However, I am pretty sure this is the old version of the product.For one thing, the smell is very, very faint. It smells nice, but I can hardly smell it right after spraying, and I can't smell it at all after the first minute. I thought maybe my nose was just not working, so I asked several friends and family if they could smell it, and they said they couldn't smell it either. Even when I used a ton of sprays and even resorted to spraying it on my clothes, it simply didn't last. The one I tried out in Sephora was strong and lasted quite a while.The scent issue wouldn't have been so bad if this stuff actually did anything for my hair as it claims it does, but it doesn't do anything. It didn't tame my fly aways or frizz or make it look shiny.I don't like leaving negative feedback and I definitely don't like accusing people easily, so I don't make this claim lightly. I spent hours researching. I went to the official website of Aquolina and on their facebook page and the bottle they show looks completely different from mine. I went to several different websites, including Sephora, and again, the bottle looks completely different from this one.I am very upset at this, I loved this stuff when I first smelled it and was looking forward to wearing it every day. :("
2914,Pet Tornado,0/0,5.0,I ordered 2 for 2 boys ages 5 & 4 and they love them! They have no problem getting them to form tornadoes!

2916,Ice Bandana (TM) - Grey/Black,0/0,4.0,purchased as a gift so have no input as to true value to the receipent. I know it arrived in good shape
2917,"KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Toy",0/0,5.0,The only problem with this brush is it works too well! I have learned to brush my husky outside to avoid hair clean up.
2918,Erector Multi Model Building Set - 5 Different Model to Build with One Set,0/0,1.0,Trying to put this thing together for my son was a truly miserable experience. Eventually I gave up because it was so frustrating! Very sad since he bought it with his own money.
2919,Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder,1/1,5.0,"WHAT I LIKE:- Doesn't add any weird flavors to my protein shake. I put 1 teaspoon in per every 2 scoops of whey protein powder.WHAT I DISLIKE:- My protein shakes get a gritty texture with the addition of this creatine powder. Not sure if it's because the creatine isn't fully dissolved. Nevertheless, the texture doesn't make the protein difficult to drink or anything."
2920,A-Wing Fighter Ship Star Wars Return of the Jedi with Pilot Starfighter,0/0,4.0,"I really like the color scheme & weathered paint job on this toy.My only critique, is that Hasbro didn't produce a new action figure.It's a previously release figure with a different paint job & I don't like how the helmet is painted."
2921,Picture Words Flash Cards,0/0,4.0,"I bought these for my 18-month-old twins so that we could learn words and practice animal sounds. The cards are thin and bend easily, but there are a lot of them and the price is right. I keep these out for impromptu playing whereas I put up some of our more expensive learning cards that bend (Your Baby Can Read). The only negative is having to pick them up when they get scattered all over the floor."
2922,"Compac Select Safe-T-Shapes Bathtub Decals, Daisy",0/0,5.0,I've had these for several years and they are holding up superbly. I got one wrong at first and couldn't get it removed so it still is wrinkled.
2923,Britney Spears Women's Fantasy Eau de Parfum,0/0,5.0,"I get compliments almost every time I wear this perfume from men and women. People are usually surprised when I say it's a Britney Spears fragrance, I guess they were expecting me to say Prada or something. Nope...it's Britney, b*tch. I will be wearing this one for a loooog time."
2924,HALO Newborn Micro-Fleece Sleepsack Swaddle,0/0,5.0,Great quality; was exactly what my fussy daughter needed...the best swaddling product on the market. Well worth the higher price tag.
2925,Pokemon - Ancient Mew - Pokemon Promos,0/1,5.0,"I'm a collecter of Pokemon Cards, and this is a great adition to a collection. If you plan to use it battles, you'll need to have a translation, but it's a really cool card."
2926,Compression Gloves for Arthritis,1/1,4.0,"they keep my hands warm and as I sleep with them on, I find my hands are not as stiff in the morning when I wake up."
2927,"Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, Lighted",0/0,5.0,"Does a nice job on ears. You can tell when it finds a hair by the pitch change. Tickles when doing nose hair, but not much can be done about that. It doesn't pull or grab at all."
2928,Armani Code,0/0,3.0,Good fragrance. The perfume is a bit expensive compared to its worth though. Should be more economical. Bottle shape can be improved too.
2929,LifeEssence - The Master Multiple,1/1,5.0,"I am 72 years old and I have taken close to 50 different multi-vitamins in my life. I believe this is the best. It gives you a lot of energy. I have no cons to list. I take 2 tablets with my breakfast, one with lunch, & one with dinner. I noticed in some reviews people were taken 2 or 3 tablets per day. The recommended dosage is 4 so if you only take 2 you are only getting 50% of nutrients each day."
2930,"Snorestop Extinguisher, 0.4 Oz -Plastic Case",0/0,1.0,"Followed the instructions as written, but the situation did not improve. Nothing against the product, but maybe my snoring situation is unique or particular."
2931,Sesame Street Puppets,0/0,5.0,My granddaughter's favorite puppet. Can't wait to see her face at Christmas. There will be many happy times ahead with her.
2932,Optimum Nutrition Glutamine 1000mg,0/0,5.0,"To me the pill size was totally fine. I was taking glutamin before I switched to a complete protein mix and I think it does the job - I recovered much faster from my training sessions and felt much better overall.I was taking it twice a day as a supplement for fitness (I'm not building any muscles, just general fitness)."
2933,Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper,0/0,4.0,I wanted a pregnancy pillow that would fit in our queen sized bed comfortably... the Snoogle mini is the way to go! Four stars (and not five) for these two reasons

2936,Uglydoll Classic Plush Doll,0/0,5.0,"Got these for my teenager for Easter, bought them here because the price was reasonable, love the names and their stories. Highly Recommend."
2937,Ore Originals Peek A Boo Comb and Brush Set,1/1,5.0,...to keep the wood from splitting when wet.let it dry BRISTLES FACING DOWN so that the water runs off the brush and does not collect at the base. this is a simple solution but if you don't do it the wood will buckle and crack. I read all the reviews that mention this and bought it anyway thinking the company might have solved it. they had not. so my brush faded and split after the initial wash the company recommended in the instruction. I retuned that brush (thank you amazon) and got a replacement. it has worked perfectly and I have washed a couple times since.
2938,Savings Goal ATM Bank,2/2,3.0,This bank is loud but useful. It teach my 9 year old son how to count and subtract his money just like a real bank. This also helps him balance his money. Nice bank. For loudness cover the speaker with a sticker this will bring the sound down just a little.
2939,"Knorr Peppercorn Sauce Mix, 1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,My mom uses it in her gravy recipe along with port or marsala wine and the turkey drippings. She thickens the gravy with potato water. The peppercorn sauce adds good flavor to the mix.
2940,Body Shop Cocoa Butter Body Butter 6.9 Oz.,1/1,5.0,"I've suffered from eczema for 22 years and have tried literally everything to get rid of it. More patches show up every winter and my skin feels like an alligator's. I bought this on a whim with a 40% coupon and haven't been using this one week and my eczema its completely gone. Yes, it does leave a little bit of a film but so what. I'm eczema free for the first time in 22 years. Yeah!!"
2941,Schylling Paint Your Own Tea Set,0/0,5.0,"When I received this, I thought that it was too small, but my four year old granddaughter loved it. She couldn't wait until it was painted to play with it, so she played with it for an evening while it was still white. Then she painted it. I sat by and helped rinse the brush when she changed colors. We had a great time. It was hard for her to wait until it was baked so that she could play with it again."
2942,Oster Blade Lube Premium Lubricating Oil for Clippers and Blades Hair Clippers Trimmers And Groomers,0/0,4.0,"Good value for the price. Machines do cut better with lube used frequently. Not much more you can say about engine lube,"
2943,Now Foods Nutritional Yeast,5/5,5.0,"This product seems like a good deal for me. I use nutritional yeast a lot to flavor soups (makes them taste heartier, try it!) and it's very convenient to have it in a sturdy, resealable container like this.This is yeast powder. I've also gotten yeast ""flakes"" in the bulk section of the grocery store before, those are much bigger. I prefer the powder for something like soups because it dissolves almost instantly in the broth.Very handy to have if you cook vegan recipes as it has a bit of a cheesy flavor."
2944,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,I love this litter box. I had one some years ago and searched the internet when I got two cats. Finally found it and am very happy. It makes cleaning the litter box literally an easy quick job.
2945,CryoCup - Set of Two,0/0,5.0,Works great. Found this in physical therapy session and went home to buy it. Works great for after workouts on sore areas.
2946,Nature's Way Dong Quai,0/2,1.0,"After high expectations, I found this supplement to provide nothing but a supplement to the vendor's wallet. I will not be ordering again."
2947,Star Wars Jedi Knight (Qui-Gon Jinn) Lightsaber,0/1,1.0,"I bought this product two times and I ended returning it. Whew! Dont buy. Waste of money. Even they will give it for free, I will still return it."

2951,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,0/0,4.0,"I bought this toy for my grandson to play with while at my house. At 8 months he didn't do anything with it at all... I took the lid off and he did throw a few shapes into the open bucket. If you are worried about any chemicals, this would not be the age to give it to your child. I am not too concerned about that, as he really hasn't put the pieces in his mouth much.Now, at almost 14 months, my grandson is just starting to try to fit the shapes through the holes in the lid. The lid does not snap on.. and doesn't stay on well if the child knocks the toy around at all... however, it sure isn't a problem for him to take the lid off of the bucket when he wants to! I believe later on he may like to carry the bucket around with toys in it.. So, I think we will get a lot of use out of this toy. Definitely worth the money."
2952,Clearblue Fertility Monitor 1 Count,0/0,5.0,Such a great item!!! Such a reliable way to really track and learn your cycle. Have been using mine for 6 months now and love it!!!
2953,Duro-Med Aluminum Adjustable Cane with Offset Handle,0/0,5.0,"Adorable, stylish and very solid without being heavy. I've had many compliments, including one from the gal at the local medical supply who carries nothing like it. Great buy!"
2954,MAG-OXIDE TB 400 MG *RIS Size,0/0,5.0,"Read about magnesium and how it aids in preventing kidney stones. Doubled my water intake and daily magnesium, going on three years with no repeat ER visits."
2955,Child to Cherish Going To Grandma's Suitcase,0/0,4.0,I purchased this item for my grandson's birthday. He really seemed to enjoy it. I can'w wait until he brings it when he visits. It seems to be the perfect size to hold his treasures!
2956,Burberry Brit ~ Women 3.3 oz / 100 ml Eau de Parfum Spray,2/2,5.0,"Ordered this item today and then saw the 1-star reviews saying that it was fake, even when ""shipped and sold by Amazon."" Just to be sure, I contacted Amazon who, aside from assuring me it would be authentic (which I will verify when I receive the order), told me that although I cannot ship them back the item/return the item, if it is not authentic/""I don't like it"" they will issue me a full refund. As this is the policy, the product is much cheaper here than in stores, and i'm not ordering in a last minute rush for Christmas or something, it seems like a reasonable chance to take."
2957,"Now Foods, Sweet Almond Oil",0/0,5.0,"I have done away with hand and body lotion and use this oil for both. It also works wonders on my kids' sensitive skin in the harsh winter months. A little goes a long way, and this is a great value for how long it will last!"
2958,"Conair Supreme Triple Curling Iron Pack - 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch and 1 inch",0/0,1.0,"Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS IRON PACK. I got mine a while ago and they don't hold my curls AT ALL. It was pure disappointment and I strongly suggest you not to make the same mistake I made. I'd give it 0 star if I could. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
2959,So De La Renta By Oscar De La Renta For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I love this product. It is a light fragrance. I rated this product a 5 because it has a great smell and it was very cheap. If you buy this product out of Macy, you will spend more."
2960,Mardel Freshwater CopperSafe,0/0,5.0,"I have a small tank (5-1/2 gallon) with 4 fancy guppies and 2 cory catfish. One of the catfish developed white spots and red streaks, appeared to have balance problems & stopped eating, while all of the other fish seemed to remain healthy. I am new at keeping fish, and admit I have no idea exactly what was affecting this catfish. I removed him to a hospital tank and dosed him with a different product which clearly hurt rather than helped. I returned him to the main tank and dosed it with a combination of Mardel Coppersafe and Maracyn Two. This caused no adverse reaction from any of the fish, and the ailing catfish began to look better. After five days of the combination meds, the catfish has no signs of distress and the spots and red streaks have completely disappeared. I hadn't thought he would survive, but he is now busily searching for food and he looks healthy. I will continue treatment with Coppersafe for a total of 30 days to be sure there are no more infestations in the tank or filter. Coppersafe does not die the water blue nor does it stain the tank. Mardel Customer Service was easy to reach and very helpful when I had questions about their products. Coppersafe used with Maracyn Two treats a wide spectrum of problems and certainly worked well for me."
2961,Mousetrap,1/1,1.0,"The pieces are flimsy and not durable! My daughter received this game for her birthday and it lasted about a year. The parts did not fit well and the action was clunker at best! As a kid I had the exact same one back in the 1970's but the one back then was better built then this modern day version. We outgrew ours and my mom sold it at a garage sale. Funny thing...it still worked well when she sold it and looking back I wish I still had it!Bottom line, dont buy this modern version of Mousetrap. It's flimsy junk!"
2962,Stainless Steel Pet Coop Cup,0/0,5.0,My cats like this container for their food rather than water. The reflection in the stainless steel bowl worries them.
2963,Tigi S Factor Serious Conditioner,0/0,5.0,Does a good job of conditioning. Not too heavy and I find it helps smooth out my curls. Makes flat ironing easier.
2964,"Flexi Retractable All Belt Lead, 16ft",0/0,5.0,It's a very good leash although it has the same circular about amputated fingers as the string leash! But I decided to keep this one b/c it's what I wanted and I just have to avoid grabbing the leash itself instead of setting the built-in &#34;brake&#34;.
2965,"Zanies Polyester Mega Plush Bones Dog Toys, 16-1/2-Inch, (Colors Vary)",0/0,5.0,"I have a small Jack Russel, so this is hilarious to watch him carry it around. So far he hasn't torn out the squeakers, but it's been less that a week. Seems to be a favorite."

2967,Bone Suckin' Sauce Sauce's,0/0,4.0,"The sauce a good taste, sweet with a hint of heat. Just wished it was a thicker sauce, to me it is more of a marinate"
2968,"Lamaze Play & Grow Take Along Toy, Firefly",1/1,3.0,"when I ordered I liked because it is very colorful and has few things on it which should be good on the go , but found it is little big for small hands and rest of the features(tether , mirror etc) are not much useful . It is little expensive for its worth.It is ok to have but can explore more options."
2969,Medela Pump & Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack,0/0,3.0,I use Medela breastmilk bag in the first but later when milk production increases Lansinoh becomes my favorite. Lansinoh can hold more milk and it has double seal.

2971,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"I found this color while getting a pedicure on Halloween and loved it so much that I ended up getting a manicure too, which I never do! The color is beautiful. Just enough shine and sparkle with a beautiful dark tone. If was beautiful for Halloween and will look great for Christmas too!. Year round really! Also, I am a huge fan of Zoya. Their colors last. No chipping here!"

2973,Medela Breast Pump Accessory Set,0/0,5.0,"these worked great. The bags are kind of a pain in the butt to use. you can only put so many bottles/items and you can only use it 20 times , I believe. Everything was just as described. thank you!"
2974,Infantino Barn Shape Sorter,0/0,5.0,"My son loved this toy as infant and still enjoys it as a toddler. As an infant her enjoyed opening the door and placing the pieces in. As a toddler he likes to put the puzzle together and work on putting the letters through the sorter. This toy is great for hand eye coordination, fine and gross motor skill refinement, and challenges them to sort out while working through a small puzzle. It teaches them shapes, colors and animals as well. I love the price tag for all the educational quality that this toy has. It is also well made good quality toy. The handle is also great for toting it around. This is a fun and educational toy."
2975,"Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, 1.7 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I love it! It makes my face feel like butter, super soft. I use it every night and miss it when it's gone. I try everything and have not found something I like better."

2977,Thumper Versa Pro Professional-Strength Lower Body Massager,0/0,5.0,"I am on my feet all day, and this product works very well on my tired achy feet. I use it only for 5-10min every day when I get home, and they feel refreshed.I do agree with previous reviews, it is a little noisy. But I have a mini-thumper Pro, and was expecting that kind of noise. (it's from using the percussion technique instead of vibration)--but that's why it works!"
2978,Melissa & Doug Firefighter Puppet,0/0,5.0,"7 year old thinks this is great. He had enjoyed a friend,s and was delighted to get the same puppet himself. Well made, fun to use and a joy to watch being used I might add."
2979,Bumkins Waterproof Junior Bib,0/0,5.0,This is basically like a full size tshirt bib combo. It works really well and is really easy to clean and wash off.
2980,Ecco Bella Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil,0/0,5.0,I love this product. It looks just as good as any other mascara. I fall asleep in my makeup a lot and I love that when I wake up in the morning it's not smeared all over my eyes like other mascara. I enjoy knowing I'm putting less harmful chemicals in my precious eyeballs. Highly recommended.
2981,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey,0/0,5.0,"I have used ON products in the past and have always been satisfied. I stopped using their protein for a little while ($) and the other protein that I used just wasn't the same.This is my first time trying the Natural Whey and I am going to stick with it. The taste is tolerable when used alone but I usually mix with fruit, or a green drink powder.Oh and I get monthly blood work and my protein levels are higher with this(7.3) then the other protein that I used (6.7)."
2982,Ayate Fiber Body Scrubber Cloth,1/1,5.0,"I'm a big fan of exfoliating cloth because it's great for the skin, but often times, they fall apart or get worn quite fast. This cloth differs. It's all natural and not made in China. And it looks and feels like it's made of good quality, so I think it will definitely last longer than other exfoliating cloths. When I first got it, I left it in hot water to soak overnight to soften it. It does shrink but is still a good size to use. Now, right before I jump in the shower, I just drop it in warm water to soften the plant fibers. It's great when used with a bath gel, like EO's Rose and Chamomile."
2983,Crayola Washable Watercolors 24ct Pan w/brush,0/0,5.0,"This is a great product!! I bought these for my 2yr. old granddaughter who loves to paint, the colors are very bright"
2984,The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup,0/0,5.0,These were really a hit with my two grandkids and their mom. The two year old has started biting the soft plastic tips off of the other sippy cups. These are hard plastic and much more durable. They both love The Toy Story. These are very easy to clean and don't have a lot of different parts to lose.
2985,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",1/4,1.0,"Not only do the clumps fall into the shovel container but also a lot of the unused kitty litter (which is not cheapO then the unused kitty litter in the shovel along with the unused kitty litter has to be sifted in order to retain the unusded kitty litter. Used kitty litter gets into the run that holds the screen in place and creates a clumpy mess that has to be washed in order to get the clump out of the crease, I give the product a 1/2 out of 5 points, and the half is for effort. Thanks anyway. I would return the kitty box for credit but while I was putting the self cleaning box together one of the cats urinated in the cardboard box and made it unuseable. If you can send another box you can have the product back. Sheila"
2986,Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I've been shaving my head ever since I joined the US Army in 2005, I've gone through countless numbers of balding clippers and this one is by far the best. Close shave every time and you don't have to go over the same spot 100 times to make sure the hair is all the same length, so close in fact you can use it to shave your face without any irritation. If your a bald guy like me get this shaver, the rotary motor is so much better than the cheap ones."
2987,Gumabone Chicken Bone Dog Chew Toy,0/0,2.0,"My dog is an average chewer and he was able to tear chunks out of this immediately. I took it away from him because I didn't want him to choke on pieces or swallow them. Sadly, it was a waste of money."
2988,"Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Bar, 1.45-Ounce Bars (Pack of 36)",0/0,5.0,"Americans tend to prefer milk chocolate over dark, yet dark has many more benefits than milk does. Dark chocolate has healthy antioxidants and is heart healthy when eaten in moderation. Hershey's brand special dark chocolate is the best out there by far, it is bittersweet. Not the intangible intense sweetness from milk chocolate or extreme bitter with over 60% cocoa dark chocolate, but delicious bittersweet Hershey's special dark. C'est un tr&egrave;s bien chocolat!"
2989,Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box,0/0,3.0,The lid came with a crack on the top and was also bent. I had to bend it back out to fit the bottom piece.
2990,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,3.0,"I didn't expect it to be entirely made of plastic, and thought that for the price that at least SOME of it would be metal or a durable material, but it wasn't. Also, the UV pen nibs were dried out upon arrival, which was also a pretty big downer. It was a little disappointing, but my girlfriend still loved it, so I'm happy."
2991,"Play Along Club 13"" Doll ""Girlfriends"" Olivia Reese (Styles May Vary)",0/0,5.0,"I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks"
2992,Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners,0/0,5.0,"People wrote that it didn't work out because of the double-sided tape. Yeah ... no kidding. Kids naturally would rip it off. What did they expect? I used velcro and it worked great. Alright, rip it off? Just put it back on. Soft, but good material for protection."
2993,Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox,0/0,5.0,"I did not think that my cat Layla would use this litter box but I decided to try it anyway...BEST LITTERBOX EVER!!!!!! I've tried a hooded and sifting litterbox. Cleaning both was a huge pain in the butt. I would have to sweep up the litter that spilled out of the box, wipe down walls when she should somehow miss the box, and I've even had to clean up poo off of the floor that didn't make it with the rest. Since I've been using the top entry litterbox I not only don't have to look at the undesirables when I'm in the laundry room, but I rarely have to sweep. I do not have to wipe yucky stuff off of the walls and it's super easy to clean! I did put a step stool beside the litterbox so she wouldn't have to jump up so high. This box is the best! I wish I would have gotten one sooner!"
2994,Tolo Toys Mr. Croak,1/1,5.0,"I have no idea what the first reviewer got in the mail when she ordered Mr. Croak, but I got this for my son who is now two and half and he still loves this frog. If you're more of a hands-off parent who expects your child to occupy himself with a tv or a musical or light up toy while you do laundry, cook or leave the room for longer periods, maybe it's not what you're looking for. If you are looking for a great developmental toy that you use to play with your child, it's awesome and adorable to boot. It's well-made and unique and allows you to help your baby develop gross motor skills while teething on the little extras attached to it. It is very well made, not plastic cheap China-made crap. It's a plush toy made with a variety of different feeling textiles, has a croaking sound when you flip the frog upside down, has one hand that squeeks and another that rattles. It has a little mirror on his belly, a pouch with a flower that babies can take in and out or teeth on as well as a crinkly sounding dragonfly attached to it, numbers on the fingers, a pull cord vibrating tongue, and it's really bright and fun. It makes an adorable decroation in the room while my son isn't carrying it around with him everywhere. Does it talk to you, sing to you, light up with flashy lights or act as a babysitter? Nope, but it's one of his and my favorite and unique toys."
2995,Panasonic EW3122S Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor (Silver),0/0,5.0,I purchased this at recommendation of my 86 year old mother cardiac doctor.lHas worked well and is easy for my mom to do herself and the numbers are large which is must for her poor eyesight.
2996,Vademecum mouthwash and gargle concentrate - 2.5 oz,0/0,1.0,"I have been using Vedemecum for a very long time and I have to say this is a very good mouthwash at least far better than those Listerine or other products available in the US market. It doesn't have alcohol nor make me feel like I have to brush my teeth again because of that sweet yucky after taste Listerine or other mouthwash products have. The problem I have is the seller, Medideals. At the time I placed an order, there was nothing indicating that it could take Medideal anywhere from 30 to 45 days to deliver these products to me. Once I found out that my order will only be delivered to me any time during Nov 30 to Dec 13 (I placed this order on Oct 31), I called Amazon's customer services department and indicated to them that I no longer want these products. Who would want to wait for 45 days just to get two bottles of mouthwash???? Well, definitely not me for sure. Unfortunately, they already shipped my order and here is the catch!!!! I later found out that they are located in U.K., hence the reason why it takes them so long to deliver my order. None of the information as to how long it takes to deliver the products nor the location of the vendor has been made clear to me at the time of purchase. Had I known, I would not have placed an order with this seller. So, BUYER BEWARE, if you are not in UK like me (I live in US) and have a problem with the products and/or vendor services, you are on your own!!!! Well, you can pretty much kiss good bye to the return policy. Shipping the product back from U.S. to U.K. probably cost more than the product itself. I am just wondering why they would even bother having the return policy. Amazon should have made it clear where their 3rd party vendors are located so we, as a customer, can decide whether we want to buy products from overseas sellers. As of now, I am still waiting to see whether I will ever get the products I ordered. Overall, it is just a very bad experience. I gave them the lowest rating allowed but, in fact, I would rather give them zero or lower!!!! All I can say is I will never ever buy anything from Medideals again and will be very wary of buying any products from 3rd party sellers in Amazon website."
2997,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,5.0,The quality is great and the colors are bright. Each puzzle board are very attractive to my son who's 1.5 yr. Great teaching/learning tool. So far it's withstanding trip into his mouth and chewing pretty well too :P
2998,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,2.0,This didn't work for us...my child would just keep right on sucking that thumb without missing a beat! We ended up getting a device at the dental office that actually helped stopped this habit. It wasn't cheap ($200) but it was the only thing that worked for us!
2999,Spry Chewing Gum 100 ea,0/0,4.0,This gum is super tasty and strong. Mmmm. The label says it helps you fight cavities. With that said it tends to loose flavor relatively quickly.
3000,Futurama Bright n' Shiny Bender Wind-Up Tin Robot,0/0,4.0,"There are plenty of adults who love Futurama and Bender. This wind-up robot toy is a blast. I think it will last OK if it is used ocassionally, but have no idea how durable it is as a child's toy."
3001,Optimum Nutrition CLA 750mg,0/0,5.0,"Optimum Nutrition is one of my favorite brands of supplements. These pills are softgels just a little bit smaller than the general size of a fish oil pill offered by most. They look black but hold them up to the light and you can see a redish see through color they are just really compact. No aftertaste or anything from these since they are softgels. Check out the internet for benefits of CLA and how much you have to take to actually benefit from this product.I like the value/price of Optimum Nutrition. Visit their website and you can get a ton of information. Sure their labels look a littler generic, but I actually like that...they show you what the product is, tell you what's in it without a bunch of flashy neon colors and fancy names no one can pronounce like a lot fo the other supplement companies."
3002,Zoo Med Laboratories SZMMWS Zoo African Mopani Wood Small,0/0,5.0,"The small and medium sized pieces I bought were approximately the same size, which turned out to be a good thing for me. Based on other wood I've bought from Zoo Med sight-unseen, I was hopeful that I would get good-looking pieces and I wasn'[r disappointed. Not a lot of money, so I think it's worth the gamble. I'll buy more."
3003,Y Spindle for Gate Installation (2 Pack) from KidCo,0/0,5.0,"I read all the reviews and was still skeptical. How could something so weird looking meet all these expectations? Well, it does! I have had 2 up for about 5 months now and they work great! I read the review that said its hard to give a piece of metal 5 stars & it's true. It does exactly what it says. The gate is very sturdy even when my 11 month old hangs on it & shakes it! I am very impressed with this product."
3004,Hot Tools Professional Ceramic Titanium Professional Curling Iron,0/0,5.0,"This curling iron heat up fast and easy to use. It comes in my favorite purple color. Compare to other curling iron I used before, it makes my hair really smooth and very easy to use."
3005,ISO MainTamer (1 application),1/1,5.0,I've been using this for years....First my hair stylist used it...then I purchased on my own for in between keratin treatments....Absolutely love it.....It does what it says....it tames and softens and makes your hair manageable.
3006,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,2.0,The dimensions are correct but it is very thin. It is about the same thickness (padding) as a thin down comforter. This is more of a topper than a bed.
3007,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,2.0,"The mirror has been installed in the shower for a couple of weeks, we wipe it off after each use. There is rust in two area which is unsettling!"
3008,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,2.0,"This is a good nail polish, but it doesn't show very much. It is kind of clear. I have to put 3 layers for it to show. but it's a nice color"
3009,Puzz 3D 718 pc U.S Capitol 3d puzzle,0/0,5.0,Perfect gift! Lot's of pieces. These 3-D puzzles are challenging yet fun. This can also be a good learning tool for US History.
3010,EeBoo Paper Doll Game,0/0,5.0,What a cute and simple game. The dolls and clothing are made of hard cardboard but very nicely made. Basically the game is very simple. Each player chooses a doll and the the game begins. You spin the spinner and begin to dress your doll. If you spin hat and you have already dressed your doll in a hat you can trade that hat in for another one. There is also a spot where you have to turn in a piece of clothing if you land on it. The first one to dress her doll wins. It is a simple and fun game. EeBoo has another winner !!!
3011,Marine Lipid Nu-11 8-in-1 Omega 3 (200softgels),0/0,5.0,"It is not just omega 3 but alot more(read the back label).Much more absorbable, than regular Omega 3. Great combinations antyoxydants too"
3012,"Aller G-3 Liquid with Pump for Dogs and Cats, 8 ounce",1/3,1.0,"This product really makes my cat sick!! I have totally healthy cat that never sick or vomit food in his life. As direction written on the product, I fed half pump of Allerg3 with food. Few minutes later, he puked all food he ate. I thought it couldn't be that serious at first time. So I tried to feed him as regularly but he refused to eat! The problem was my cat has quite strong appetite and he never ever refuses his food in his lifetime! He vomited every time he tried to eat something. He couldn't digest a little treat after he ate Allerg3! It took 3 days to recover his health and eat again without vomiting. It almost killed my precious cat!!!!!! If you're thinking about to feed this product to your cat, please think twice before you buy & feed it to your cat cuz it may makes your cat really sick as mine did."

3014,Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet,0/0,1.0,"Really liked my old Interplak, but it finally died. Ordered a new Interplak that was the closest to my old Interplak. Big mistake. New water jet doesn't even have a fraction of the pressure of the old water jet and I have to prime it every time I want to use it. Just printed out the return label and it's going back to Amazon tomorrow."
3015,Light 14.8 lbs Medline Freedom Transport Wheelchair 300 lb Cap Chair- With back pocket,1/1,5.0,"I wish we would have got it sooner for mom, she's 94 and doing great except her knees are bad, but likes to go everywhere. It is so light to take in and out and carry, one handed as I broke my left wrist. It fits under the table and even my great grandchildren can push her around. It's fits perfect behind my seat in the van. Folds closed and opens very easy. We haven't used the regular wheelchair since we got this one. It's great!!!"
3016,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/1,1.0,"At 8 or 9 months old, my son was strapped into this chair and threw his body forward with enough force to face plant onto a hard wooden floor with the chair on top of him. I was able to watch it on the monitor that has replay and it was totally scarry. Avoid."
3017,Gu GU Energy Gel- 24 Pack,0/0,4.0,Easy packets to carry in biking jersey pockets for continued energy. This flavor is the only one that I liked.
3018,Moisturizing Shampoo from Kenra [10.1 oz],0/0,5.0,Good price for a great product. It's less expensive than buying in a store or shop. I also use the Kenra conditioner.
3019,"Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil Topical Aerosol, Easy-to-Use Foam, 2.11 Ounce, (Packaging May Vary)",0/2,3.0,I have to admit that I haven't used it enough to get ideal results. I am still needing to finish what I have and be more consistent with it.
3020,"L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara, 0.28-Fluid Ounce",0/0,3.0,"It is thick and clumpy when taking the wand out of the tube. You even have to wipe off the clumps before applying. Then while you are wearing it, it smudges. Not worth buying again."
3021,Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver,0/0,4.0,"Works great if you aren't trying to trim thick hair, but it is not intended to work for thick hair, either."
3022,"Kyolic Formula 103 200 Caps ( Aged Garlic Extract with C, Astragalus & Mushrooms ) - Wakunaga",0/0,5.0,This brand was recommended by a friend who used to manage a supplement store. She was spot on - no aftertaste or garlic burps. Great product ? One suggestion - never take any garlic supplement with soda!
3023,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",0/0,2.0,"I paid 20 dollars for this thing... and then Amazon dropped it to $10, not going to fool with returning.. I need some kind of noise to sleep, and for many years used a similar product, same price...but, it bit the dust recently... So I bought the Conair...the sounds are terrible and repeat ever 4 to 5 seconds, even the ""white noise"" loop is about 4 seconds on the one I received, and it has a ""clapping"" sound at the beginning of the loop..... may be worth $10... but I going for the Marpac this time...."
3024,Vital Wheat Gluten - 3.5 Pound Can,0/0,5.0,"Having recently switched to a vegan diet, but still requiring high protein due to caloric restriction, I've been relying highly on vital wheat gluten to supplement my meat intake. I've tried a few different brands, but found that cost wise and quality wise, Honeyville is one of my favorites.I find that compared to other brands, Honeyville has a very smooth texture, and makes a better product than others (ie when I make seitan dogs it steams more evenly, retains some moisture and porousness), and takes on flavors better. I had been using the WinCo brand from their bulk bins, and found that once I switched to Honeyville that my foods reheat more evenly, which is a big thing in my house since I tend to make a week's worth of &#34;wheat meat&#34; in advance, and then we use it in our recipes as the week goes on.It's also handy to have the can to store the Vital Wheat Gluten in. It's large enough that I can put measuring cups directly in, rather than hassling with the mess of a bag or of a mason jar or other storage container."
3025,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,1/1,1.0,"I put Frontline on my bichons in September, and noticed that they still were getting flea dirt. I applied again in October before I left for a two week vacation. When I returned home, the dogs, who were being cared for in my home by my neighbor, were so infested with fleas, they had begun having a horrible allergic reaction to them. They completely ripped the hair off their tails and left a bloody, scabbing mess. Their hind ends were also a bloody matted mess. After a prescription flea treatment, antibiotics, steroids, and the ""cone of shame"", they are finally on the road to recovery. But no thanks to Frontline. It is useless. You might as well treat your dogs with water. And I just purchased a brand new, unopened package of Frontline from Amazon. When I looked into returning, I discovered that I cannot return the product because Amazon considers it a hazardous material. Huh? VERY DISAPPOINTED in Frontline AND Amazon. (See my follow up comment following.)"
3026,Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat,0/0,3.0,"Overall this does the job, but it's not perfect.Pros:1. Good size2. Easy to cleanCons:1. Suction cups don't stick well to our wooden table2. Crumb catcher is a nice idea, but became a toy on day 2 for our 11-month-old - we cut it off.Again, overall it does the job. Our daughter does try to fold it up and pull it off the table, but at least 3 of the suction cups work relatively well so she can't get it completely off and I'd rather deal with that than whole dishes of food hitting the floor. My husband loves the disposable place mats that I got to take to restaurants better because they tape down completely on all four sides, but they're a little pricey to use for every meal so this works."
3027,Jarrow Formulas Bromelain 1000,0/1,5.0,I love this product. I'd recommend it highly to anyone interested in a good quality bromelain. Jarrow is a great company.
3028,Beauty Drops Vitamin E Facial Moisturizer Cream 2800 IU 2 oz,0/0,4.0,I didn't give it 5 stars because it has a tad bit of a greasy feel to it...making it take longer to &#34;dry&#34; on my face before I can put my makeup on. I feel this moisturizer protects my face from my foundation sitting in my pores....I have had less breakouts. I do recommend.
3029,Claus Porto Alface Almond Oil Bath Soap,0/0,5.0,"Claus Porto produces a beautiful product--deftly scented, variously sized and long-lasting.The almond oil bath and hand soaps are ideal for sensitive or dry skin"
3030,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,4.0,"Got two sets of these to put up around the door of our RV. No tangled leash, no knocking over chairs, freedom to move around, perfect. I store them in the RV shower. They're light enough to move around easily. The bars on each panel make them good to configure and they're sturdy enough to not be easily knocked over if bumped.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the little plastic caps on the tops of the panel bars pop off so easily, I've just taken to throwing them away. They're only cosmetic, so the functionality is not impaired, but it's a little annoying."
3031,Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning,0/0,5.0,"I chose it because it's cheap like 15 bucks. when i received it, it's really a surprise. the wind is strong. my hair is quickly dried"
3032,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,I fell in love with this color when I saw it and I was so excited to try it. I absolutely love the color but I agree with the people who said that it goes on too thinly. It also has no gloss or shine to it whatsoever and imperfections are so visible! I am tempted to mix some clear sparkle polish into it or something to thicken it up and make it better. Not the best polish by China Glaze.
3033,Horizontal Aquarium Thermometer,0/0,5.0,So far so good. I picked this one because I was trying to keep from piling too many items inside the tank. Seems to work fine.
3034,Swiss Army Eau de Toilette for Men by Swiss Army,0/0,5.0,Excelente producto!! 100% Original el perfume... Puntualidad 100%. La entrega fue en el tiempo establecido! Lo recomiendo ampliamente... Gracias...espero volver a comprarles pronto!
3035,Schleich Smurfs Large House,0/0,3.0,"First of all, my kids (2 and 5) do like this. We have a small village, with this big house, two smaller ones, and lots of Smurfs. The figurines get played with almost daily. The houses get pulled out less often. This one in particular is top heavy. The roof just does not stay put, and while it's notched to show how to orient it to put it back on, the odd shape means it's tough to balance, especially for a little kid. The shape of the base is also a bit frustrating, since it is narrower at the top. Even with the top off, and even with little hands, playing in there is just a bit cumbersome and tight. Also, while it is roomy for a Smurf or two, no accessories can fit in there, so what is Papa Smurf to do? He goes in, he comes out, but that's about it. The key and locking door is a nice touch, though, so when he goes out foraging for berries he can be sure Jokey will not come trouble his mushroom. So, would I buy it again? For over $30, no. It's great for setting the scene, but that can be done with the smaller houses, which are half the cost of this one. If you do get it (it is so darn cute, though!) BE SURE TO GLUE ALL THE EXTRAS ON. Really. They snap in okay, but they do not stay put, and alas, we have lost some parts. What Schleich should have done IMHO (and I do love their products, generally) was make the mushrooms in one piece with an open back for access. That would have made them really playable. Again, this does get some use with my kids, certainly if you are a collector go for it just for aesthetics. Since we have it I'm sure we will have it forever... It has the Schleich durability we all expect."
3036,Feliway (75mL) Spray,0/0,3.0,"I tried everything to get my cat to stop spraying, including this product, but this didn't work. I'm sure it works for other cats, but not for mine."
3037,"API Stress Coat Water Conditioner, 16-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I am so happy with this product. my fish loves it. i use it every time i change water and when i have new fish. I strongly recommend this product. I live in area with poor water condition. before i had this stress coat, my fish kept dying after few weeks. now i have the fish for about three months."
3038,Petstages Puppy Cuddle Pal,0/0,5.0,"This was my Benji's (Australian Shepherd) first toy. I rubbed it all over his litter mates and mother when I picked him up, warmed it nicely in the microwave and put in under a blanket one his first night.He cried all night, as any pup would. The breeder told me he would rip it to pieces in a minute and I will tell you now he is six months now and teething and he still carries it everywhere. it has one tiny tear from tug-of-war but thats it.Be mindful its small."
3039,Merrick Wilderness Blend Dog Food 30lb Bag,0/0,5.0,"I was looking for a new dog food for my two large dogs. After a couple of failures (they wouldn't eat it), Merrick passed with flying colors. They love it!"
3040,AquaClear Power Filter (UL Listed),0/0,5.0,Been using this filter for a few months now. Much cheaper to keep running than the old filter that I was using and easier to clean. The sponge will last much longer than they say it will and the carbon will too. Very pleased with my purchase.
3041,IMAK Hand / Elbow SmartGlove Size,0/0,5.0,"these gloves were recommended to me by a physical therapist who treated me for carpal tunnel syndrome, and they are wonderful. the splint on top provides support but is flexible enough to allow a good range of motion. the beads on the bottom cushion the wrist and keep the hand in a good position while typing. I wear these gloves day and night, and I am able to do almost everything with them on - write, use the computer, do housework, etc."
3042,Jarrow Formulas IronSorb,2/3,5.0,recommended for my mom who is a elderly vegan by my friend who does allergy corrections with energy vial work. My mom had had quite a lot of fatigue problems lately and this really helped her.
3043,Bare Escentuals BareMinerals,0/0,1.0,"I have used bare escentials for years, so I know how the makeup appears on my skin. Once I received this makeup, I tried it and noticed there was no coverage whatsoever and suspected it may be fake. I did some research online and it said that there should be a batch number on the bottom of each bare minerals container and warned of the dangers of fake imitations due to the high levels of copper etc that could be in it. In order to confirm my suspicions, I went and retrieved an old container which I purchased from Sephora, so I knew it was legit. Sure enough the imitation was the same in appearance, but the major difference was that the fact that there was no batch # on the imitation (There was one on the good container) and the font on the bottom label is different.Buyers Beware as there is no telling how this makeup is composed and that in itself is scary!"
3044,La Roche-posay Toleriane Gentle Dermo-cleanser,0/0,5.0,I have rosacea/seborrheic dermatitis and love this face wash. It really does work for even the most sensitive skin. Hopefully they never quit making this.
3045,Instant Heat Curling Iron,1/1,4.0,"I've had this very same Conair curling iron over the last 15 years in 3 different sizes. I've rarely had to replace them....ever. Still have the first 2 I bought about 15 years ago. Just had to replace the third size (since I used it alot) last year. Bought a different brand and am not happy with it. Wish I would've bought another one of these! So, my niece wants a curling iron for Christmas - I'm buying her this one!"
3046,DadGear Messenger,0/0,5.0,"Sold as a incognito diaper bag for guys to carry and not look matronly. But this is so well made and the features are numerous and useful. Even if you are not using it as a diaper bag, having the wet wipe dispenser is a great way to freshen up after riding in warm conditions before entering a business or your office."
3047,NutriBiotic Vegan Rice Protein Powder Vanilla -- 3 lbs,0/0,5.0,Have been using this for years...me likes! What more os there to say? :) Makes GREAT vegan smoothies & I genuinely LIKE the taste (kind of like cake batter) if you purchase vanilla...
3048,Tim Bird,0/0,5.0,"This toy is a blast to fly. I had a wind up bird like this when I was a child 35 years ago that was my favorite toy. I'm elated to find one like it today for my children! My kids and I love playing with it and do so often. It flies really well. Even a 5 year old can get it flying. The plastic wings are very fragile, but mend well with packing tape. Even when it eventually tears beyond repair I plan to buy it again - it's that much fun!"
3049,Revell of Germany 1/72 Airbus A400 M Transporter,1/2,5.0,I was very surprised the size (HUGE) for the price!!! Product description is definitely accurate. I would highly recommend this purchase.
3050,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,0/0,5.0,My 3 year old loved this! He was so excited to feed the butterflies watermelon and release the butterflies. We will definitely order more butterflies next spring!
3051,Be Amazing Lab-in-a-Bag Test Tube Wonders,0/0,5.0,"I brought this out when my kids had friends over, both boys and girls. They had a good time, it wasn't as educational, but just something fun to do in the kitchen."
3052,Ticket To Ride - Europe,0/0,5.0,"This is one of my all time favorite games. So much fun. It does take a few games to get the hang of it, but then you can really get chugging. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like a shorter and easier game of Risk. (I adore Risk, by the way.) I definitely recommend Europe version over the U.S., though the U.S. version is fun, too. The Europe version is a little more difficult as you have to contend with tunnels, foreign names, and the like. Definitely recommend."
3053,"Santa Fe Bean Co., Instant Southwestern Style Refried Beans, 7.25-Ounce Pack (Pack of 8)",0/0,5.0,I have ordered this product several times and I am never disappointed. Great Santa Fe Southwestern Style Refried Beans I will definitely purchase again.
3054,Badger Healing Balm,1/1,5.0,"I got my kids to use it because it kinda smells like root-beer or even a bit like bubble gum (from the birch oils I think). Works well on the dry skin on the backs of their hands & knuckles, especially during winter."
3055,OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM Size,0/0,3.0,"I really don't like or dislike this product. I have Blephenitis in my eyelids, which is why I bought Ocusoft. However, like so many products on the market, it hasn't eleminated the problem. Hopefully someone some day will find a solution to the problem. In the meantime, I'll keep on searching."
3056,"Planters Peanuts, Lightly Salted, Dry Roasted, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I love peanuts for a light snack, but not all of the salt in the standard version. Light salted is a great balance. These are impossible to find at the stores, but readily available on Amazon 24/7."
3057,Dr. Brown's Bottle Brush,0/0,4.0,"Does the job, great for getting in the bottles.I would prefer without the sponge on top (because germs just collect) but haven't been blue to find one with just the bristles."
3058,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/1,5.0,"Like it, love it! Not bad at all but when you set it at 10 do not put it really close to your gums as it will sting and cut ya."
3059,Bassetts Jelly Babies 215gr (7.6oz) Bag,0/0,5.0,"These are by far the best gummy candy I've ever had. I originally decided to try them because of Doctor Who, but I still keep a bag or two on hand most of the time. Plus, they're a much healthier alternative to most sugary snacks."
3060,"Hartz Wardley Goldfish Small Floating Pellets, 2-1/2-Ounce",0/0,5.0,Our fish love them! Came in on time. Packaged great. Fantastic treats for goldfish. Mine love them. Great and highly recommended.
3061,Pet Dreams Plush Sleep-eez Dog Bed Reversible Pet Bed,0/0,4.0,I bought this to fit inside the TRIXIE Dog Club House--it fit well and gives my dog a &#34;soft&#34; place to lay (rather than directly on the wooden floor). My dog dragged it out of the house and it got dirty...I'm not sure yet how it washes and dries.
3062,"Coombs Family Farms 100% Organic Maple Sugar, 25-Ounce Container",1/1,5.0,"great stuff! I have been using their pure maple syrup (and still do) so I thought I would give this product a try...so far I have used it in the following ways:to sweeten plain yogurtinstead of regular sugar in pumpkin cheesecakeinstead of regular sugar in pumpkin breadmixed with butter & cinnamon to spread on wafflesinstead of regular sugar in homestyle green beans (with bacon, salt & pepper)definitely recommend this product to sweeten the tasty treats of your life!"
3063,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,0/1,5.0,"I really like this product. Like a lot of women, if my hair isn't combed exactly right, in the back of my hair is a slight bald spot. When I use this product, it covers up the problem. The first time I used it I bought the blonde color, which allthough I'm blonde, didn't prove to be as successful as the light brown. The light brown seems to give me a better covering than the same color as my natural hair."
3064,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/1,5.0,"This item replaced our worn-out Waterpik that we had bought, and used daily, for more than 10 years. It is easier to use than the old one was."
3065,"18"" Tiger Tail Rolling Muscle Massager",0/0,5.0,My son is a cross country runner and he needed this tool after he started to experience muscle pulls in his legs. A few other teammates had them and highly recommended this product. He uses this massager after every meet and practice.
3066,Baby's My First Photo Album of Family & Friends,1/1,5.0,"I bought this album for my newest niece after seeing it at my friend's house. It's a great little album. I printed pictures of the family (near and far). She's 5 months old and likes looking at it, chewing it, and drooling on it. However, I am confident the pictures will be amusing later.She has two older sisters - 20 months and 3 years. The 20 month old points to the pictures, practicing her nouns (mommy, daddy, etc). She loves to look through every page over and over and studies the pictures and brings the book back over and over. She especially loves the ones she is in.The three year old loves to make up stories about each picture of her family. She tells about Auntie's last visit or the day they went to the park and took the pictures in the fallen leaves. She ""reads"" the stories to her sisters and they all enjoy it.All in all, this is a delight! It's sturdy construction makes it durable, droolable, and perfect. Each page is two clear plastic sheets sewn with fabric around the edges, so the drool doesn't reach the pictures (yet). It's not heavy enough to hurt when the baby swings it in someone face or anything, either. It was a PERFECT gift. I just need two more for the older girls now!I've also seen this book in a church nursery where the ""regulars"" and workers were featured throughout the books (there were several). I asked about them and the workers said they had held up great for over a year with several functions a week and a number of rough users."

3071,Soothsoft Innovations Canine Cooler,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for the dog to keep her cool in the hot weather. She really liked it. Some how, she knows to go on it when it's hot. The dog likes it, so I guess that's good enough for me!"
3072,Paraffin Wax Refill With Heat Retaining Capacity,0/0,5.0,"This is a marvelous product for hands, elbows, and feet. It is also great for dry skin and arthritis pain. Very soothing!"
3073,Prestige Sphygmomanometer and Stethoscope Kit with matching Carrying Case,0/0,1.0,"My husband chose this product because it is what he used professionally. However, he could not easily hear my heartbeat with this stethoscope. It now sits unused on the shelf and I bought digitalized one locally. This is my first failure on Amazon purchases so I am not complaining about them."
3074,White Plastic Jar with Flat Lid 1 Oz - 12 Per Bag,0/0,5.0,"Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon."
3075,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",0/0,5.0,"I have a beagle - beagles bark. I love my dog, don't want to hurt him, but I want the barking to stop. This does just that.And for an added bonus, he smells lemony fresh."
3076,LABRADA NUTRITION Lean Body Meal Replacement Formula,0/0,5.0,Got here fast and tastes awsome. Not chalky and kept me full for my between meal snack. Very pleased with the product.
3077,Aveda Brilliant Humectant Pomade,0/0,5.0,I'm African American and right after I blow dry my I rub in a small amount and my hair looks fabulous! Great Alternative to all that heavy oily stuff I used to use. This leaves my hair float and bouncy.
3078,"Energizer Watch/Electronic Batteries, 3 Volts, 2032, 2 batteries (Lithium Button Cell)",1/1,3.0,It is good I think because they send me the same batteries but does not look like the image. It is in a smaller paper cover. It come in from the mail but I almost throw it away because it feel smaller. I was going to sell it to my friends but now the cover is just white paper so my friends say no. I might as well keep it then.
3079,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,0/0,5.0,I use it almost daily and my hair is soft and shiny and its easy to use I would highly recommend.
3080,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set,0/0,5.0,"We bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. When we opened it up, eyes lit up around the room (and that was just the grandpas!!!)I thought he might be too young for it but he really enjoys building the track and can manipulate the cranes quite easily. It is the first thing he asks to play with when he gets up in the morning! Seems to be focussing on building the track at this stage and not so much on pushing the trains around.Based on other reviews I held off giving the raised sections til he is older. He found the supports in the cupboard and thought they were blocks. He was very excited and spends quite a bit of time building towers with them (there are around 26 wooden supports on total). So this set will definitely grow with him and in the meantime it's two toys for the price of one!One thing is there are no train stations which would only add to the imaginative play possibilities but overall this is an amazing toy. Highly recommended."
3081,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,as advertised and compared to the other variations of this soap this is mild and perfect for those who have very sensitive skin!!
3082,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/0,5.0,"Good wieght, very nice quality stethescope, esspecially for the price. The product arrived quickly. I would purchase this item again."
3083,Now Foods Bromelain,3/3,5.0,Around a year ago I started having trouble sleeping partly due to bursitis in my leg. For the past 3 months I've been taking Zyflamend Nighttime (two capsules) and Bromelain before I go to bed. I also take 1 Bromelain capsule in the morning. I'm happy to say that my bursitis bothers me much less now and there are times I can lie on that leg with little to no discomfort. It is important to know that herbs take some time to get into your system so they can have an effect on your body. I tell people to give a new herb you are trying at least 3 months to see if it will help you. Good Luck!
3084,BaByliss Pro Ceramic Tools Dual Voltage Professional Ceramic Spring Curling Iron,0/0,5.0,This is a great curling iron. It has adjustable levels for heat based on your hair type and it curls fabulously. My daugher has thick curly hair and it works just as good on hers as it does on my fine hair. Great product!!!

I bought it for this purpose and it worth it, we can breath better, the air gets a bit humid, just enough to make us confortable, I actually like to use it sometimes even when we feel ok. It works for the entire night, you just have to put the level of water it says and enough salt (a lot), mix it well and plug it. And the cleaning, I just clean it with water after every use. I recomend this product."
3099,Avlon Affirm FiberGuard Conditioning Creme Relaxer,0/0,5.0,This makes your hair straight and doesn't damage it at all. It's just silky and soft. This is the second time that I purchased it. I ordered it from Beauty Clicks here on Amazon if that helps.

3103,Bluebonnet Nutrition Earthsweet Chewable Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid Raspberry Flavor,1/1,5.0,"If you are looking for a multivitamin you can take even during that pukey first trimester, this will get you the folate you need in good tasting form. Others are powdery and get stuck on my tongue or my throat... never had a problem with these. Plus, you are more likely to remember to take them since they taste great."

3106,JW Pet Hol-ee Roller Dog Toy,0/0,2.0,"I have a 1 year old dachshund/lab/shepherd (only know the weenie for sure) pup that loves to chew on toys that have a little give. For instance, he's not a huge fan of the Nylabones durachews cause they're so tough; I think he likes to feel like he's getting something out of chewing. He kind of likes Kongs, but not that much, unless they have peanut butter in them.A lot of people wrote about how durable this thing was, but in my experience, it's not at all. After about 10 minutes with it, he'd already chewed through a piece of it, so I took it away from him. The only thing that was going to happen after that was that he would start tearing off pieces and chewing on them, just like he's done before to other toys. Guess I'll just keep looking out for a durable rubber toy that he'll actually chew on."
3107,Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my husband in 2010. He wears a mustache and goatie. His facial hair is very thick and this trimmer is perfect! It is still going strong. I knew he would love that it can be charged and he can also use it plugged in. He charges it most of the time and it still charges. It is heavy and of great quality. Definitely worth the money I paid! We have been using it lately to trim his hair on his head too. Lol. When this one goes I will definitely buy it again!
3108,Sorme Waterproof Eyebrow Pencil With Brush Soft Rich Brown #33,0/0,5.0,Long Lasting even on oily skin. The color is not too dark or light. This is the only product that I use.
3109,"Nature's Bounty Hair, Skin & Nails, 60 caplets",1/3,1.0,"TOOK AS DIRECTED AND FINISHED THE ENTIRE BOTTLE...NOTHING HAPPENED FOR MY NAILS, HAIR OR SKIN! I STOMACHED SWALLOWING THESE GIGANTIC SIZED PILLS THAT ALWAYS SCRAPPED MY THROAT ON THE WAY DOWN HOPING IT WOULD WORK BUT NO, NOTHING. I THINK MOST OF THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE AND THEY WERE PAID TO WRITE THEM IF THE COMPANY DIDN'T WRITE THEM THEIRSELVES. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
3110,CUCINA Purifying Hand Wash Refill - 33.8 fl. oz - Coriander and Olive Tree,0/0,4.0,expensive but worth it. we put this in our foaming soap dispenser and my kids really like to wash their hands!
3111,PetVision Eye Drops,0/0,1.0,This product does not work to eliminate cataracts.. If u have a punctuate or dry eye it may help but full blown cataracts no...
3112,Intex My First Pool,0/0,5.0,My 1 year old plays in it while the older children are in the big pool. She splashes and enjoys herself. There is room for 2 if another child is visiting but then each only gets one toy.
3113,Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,1/1,1.0,"Do not buy any Holiday Train Set made by Lionel. Period! I bought the Holiday Tradition Express set four years ago and it worked fine under the tree until this year. Now the thing does not work. I spoke to Lionel customer service and guess what - the set has been discontinued with no spare parts available. The service centers do not work on them. No refunds, no parts, no luck. It cannot be fixed, so now I have a nice paperweight that looks like a train. The kids are soooo disappointed this year. How can an American icon make such cheap stuff and be such rip off artists?!?! I mean the run time on my set was maybe 20 - 30 times over the last four years just at Christmas time, and now the thing does not work with no way to fix it. However cute the set looks, only purchase it if you want to ultimately waste your money! The irony here is that this supposed icon in model trains makes complete junk while another ""no name"" holiday train set I have has worked great for 20 years running. It is infuriating and sad at the same time that model electric trains are now considered overpriced throw-aways by the so-called leader in toy trains. Shame on you Lionel!"
3114,Ginger Root By Nature's Way 550 Mg,0/0,5.0,I use this to calm tummies and also occasionally for tea (when I'm out of fresh ginger and also Trader Joe's candied ginger). It's a great product and works well for my purposes.
3115,Realm by Erox for Men - 3.3 Ounce EDC Spray,0/0,5.0,"It gets me in trouble, but I still love it! Went through 3 girlfriends and 1 boyfriend before finishing the bottle! All well worth it! People just grab you! It's great!"
3116,Country Life Norwegian Kelp,0/2,5.0,"good product, good price. no reactions from ingredients it claims to not have (gluten, tree nut). Seems good to me."
3117,Perfect Pet Tubby Kat Cat Door with 4 Way Lock And LEXAN Flap,1/1,4.0,"I needed this for an indoor application to allow my cats to get to the basement for the litter box and food. One of my cats is a very large breed and is over a foot tall and weighs 17 lbs so I needed something big enough for him. My other cat is much smaller so I needed to be able to mount this at a height that was a compromise for them. Very easy to mount and looks great installed on my basement door.The only negative is my cats hated the hard plastic flap. I read several reviews about letting them get used to it, but after a day I just removed the flap and all is well. Now that they are using it I thought about putting the flap back on but have decided since it is an indoor application to just leave it as is.I did buy a second one as I have basement refinishing happening and will need another access point. I am very pleased with the purchase as this does exactly what I needed and it looks great."
3118,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,"This bottle brush is great for cleaning things your hands or dishwasher can't reach. I use it on my blender because the blades are very sharp. This is good for tall tumblers or Thermos type bottles, as well. Most parents use something like this to clean baby bottles. It doesn't hold onto food particles and cleans easily. The handle is the perfect length for really tall items."
3119,"Glad Press'n Seal Freezer Wrap, 50-Foot Rolls, (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,I love this product enough that last year I had to travel from Wisconsin to Illinois to find it and I bought out all that the store had. Now I just used the last sheet and once again can't find it in the stores. What seems to be the problem that I can't find it anywhere? This is a great product and should be on all the grocery store shelves.
3120,Incrediblock,0/1,1.0,"The vtech alphabet activity block is like the incrediblock but better, just as educational if not more, cheaper ($40), and don't have the expensive replacement blocks! The spinning wheel on top of the incrediblock seems really stupid bc when kids rest their elbow on it (it's on the top of the block remember??), it almost ruins the toy. Only 8 peekablocks ""speak"" whereas on the vtech toy, if you put the alphabet blocks in, it says each of the 26 letters! Like the incrediblock, the vtech toy also has a storage area for the blocks -- the replacement peekablocks are ridiculously expensive! Also, the batteries on the incrediblock drain VERY quickly! Put a new set of batteries into the incrediblock and batteries drained an hr later barely after any use except for the wheel on top to spin. Check it out at http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B007XVYQBI"
3121,Pipedreams Feather Tickler with Wrist Strap,0/0,3.0,"smaller than I expected, not very fluffy and feathers are equivalent to those in a craft store, I was expecting higher quality"
3122,Met-Rx Protein Plus Bars 12 ea,0/0,5.0,Great product!!! I would recommend this product to all my friends. Has been helpful after my workouts to replinish needed protein!!!
3123,"Rainbow Light, Multivitamin",0/0,5.0,My husband and l have been using this product for 3-4 years and have found that we hardly have colds anymore.
3124,"Kong Catnip Cat Toy, Squirrel",2/2,3.0,Not sure why but my cat must not like catnip because he will hardly touch this toy. It is a nice quality and comes with a large amount of extra catnip. It is easy to pick up and play with. I would recommend if your cat likes other catnip toys.
3125,"Now Foods, Glucosamine & MSM 500/500 mg",0/0,5.0,"I was reticent to try this formula as I was not convinced it would make any difference. When my joint pain became a daily occurrence and I did not want to take pain meds day in and day out, I decided to give it a try. After about two weeks I realized my joints were no longer bothering me daily. I still have some pain, but it is so greatly reduced I plan on taking this supplement for the rest of my life."
3126,North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate,0/0,5.0,"weve owned lots of gates and this one is great. easy to install, and it allows for an extension (if needed). we use it often and plan to purchase a few more."
3127,"Training Clicker for Dog, Pet, Cat, Horse - BLUE",0/0,5.0,I bought this to help train my puppy for agility competitions. The wrist band it comes with is very useful.
3128,D-Mannose,0/0,4.0,"My wife had a long term bladder infection which antibiotics would not touch. A few days on D-Mannose and it was gone, for good."
3129,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this for my boyfriend last year for Christmas, and was a bit disappointed with the result. The screwdriver is NOT realistic; it's plastic and very dull. The sound worked and was pretty fun, until it broke after about a month from use. Basically if you are expecting an exact sonic screwdriver replica, then don't go for this. It's really fun to play with though! Probably best for a child."
3130,"Marcal 100% Premium Recycled Roll Towels, 9 x 11 Inches, 60 Sheets/Roll, 15/Carton (6709)",0/0,5.0,"This company has been saving trees since 1950. From their website:""Marcal is an integral part of the northern New Jersey community. Our company uses recyclables from local municipalities and recycling facilities for our paper recycling process.""Also according to their website, they have saved over 30.5 million trees since 2000!This works, and works well. I end up paying less buy purchasing this in bulk than I would by paying retail for a 'premium' virgin-pulp paper towels at a retail grocery store."
3131,Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid,1/1,5.0,"For the money, can't beat it. There are some animals that don't respond. I suspect some animals, like humans, don't hear well in the higher frequencies. Tone frequency is not given."
3132,"Harmonic Spinning Top, Farm by Bolz",0/0,4.0,"I haven't seen a top in years, so I was worried when it didn't automatically start spinning when you push it down. Well, it has to be pumped. My son loves it and even gets the concept of having to pump it. It makes a loud, whistle/whir sound too. Glad I bought it."
3133,HUGO XX For Women By HUGO BOSS Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Me gusto mucho la colonia porque era para un regalo y para esa persona es una de sus preferidas, siempre que tengan la oportunidad se las voy a comprar."
3134,Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,0/0,3.0,I don't think they will last long and they are loose on the stove although they do the job they are designed for.
3135,Medela Nursing Stool,0/0,5.0,"The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short, so I needed something for my feet to rest on. I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby."
3136,FOREVER AFTER ALL DAY MOISTURIZER 22 FL OZ AUSTRALIAN GOLD,0/0,5.0,"This purchase was my third time purchasing this lotion, and I love it! My skin is super soft! I get stopped all the time by people asking me what my scent is that I am wearing. This lotion has a great light scent, I rarely have to wear perfume anymore. Worth trying for sure!!"
3137,Elasto Gel Hot / Cold Sinus Mask,1/2,1.0,"For now this gets a 1 star because there's a giant part on the top that isn't even stitched. If this is intended then I apologize and will change this to a better rating, but it looks odd to me. And it's not mentioned anywhere about there being a giant part that isn't stitched closed. It's kind of in the middle but more to the left a little bit. And also when the product came the velcro part of the strap was stuck to the blue gel part (the side you put on your face) and even while gently pulling it off it managed to damage it a little bit. While that's a bummer, the biggest issue for me is the stitching at the top. As far as I'm aware there's no reason to ever take it out of it's pouch so why would it be like that? I hope they didn't send me a used product..."
3138,JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,0/0,5.0,We use this blanket mainly in the house on the carpet so our little one can crawl around without getting rug burns or dirt stains on our hardwood floors. We've used it outside a few times on the grass and its come in so handy. Its the right size to fit two adults and doesnt stain very fast. Its also easy to clean. A must buy
3139,Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,5.0,I love the versatility of this bench seat cover and it is EASY to install. I just wish the straps were more adjustable. I have a Soul and it does fit but it's a little big. I wish they have more colors to choose from. I like that it is washable. I wish they had a way to tighten the cover on the bottom more securely. It probably fits perfect in a pick up truck. I was using mattress pad cover to cover my back seat for my dogs so this is far better and more secure than a mattress pad cover.
3140,"Star Fiber Star Mop Micro Fiber Refill Pad, Set of 3",0/0,5.0,Been using this mop and pad on my wood floors for years...tried a few others but none as good as the real star fiber products! The pad that most retail stores sell that starts with a b and ends with an a can't compare!
3141,"Zoo Med Stainless Steel Feeding Tongs, 10-Inch",0/0,5.0,These are very handy. I have two sets at home that I use for maintaining and feeding my tarantula collection. They are invaluable when dealing with that grumpy OBT or trying to catch a leftover cricket in your premolt Mexican redknee's cage. They are also good for reaching those hard to reach objects you drop behind the couch or down the vent. They are so handy that I purchased this set for my work.
3142,OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack,0/0,3.0,"I wanted to try another brand of wipes, and I'm not 100% pleased with these. I'll admit, I was lured by the price (I bought them on another site for a better price than Amazon). They are very thin and shrink considerably during the first laundering. They tend to stick to the diaper pieces in the dryer and don't spread out/open easily once placed in the diaper wipe solution and wrung out. I wind up trying to use two hands, but anyone with small children knows that won't work. So, I wind up trying to shake the wipe open with one hand - and I get drips of solution everywhere. On the positive side, they are soft, and do the job. I haven't owned them long enough to figure out if they fray or not. Once they do, I'll probably toss them. Personally, I prefer something thicker and our favorite brand is GroVia. They are a little more expensive, but time and efficiency are precious commodities!I won't buy these again and I wouldn't recommend them."
3143,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,I love this color so much! I got compliments on this color. Essie is a good nail company. The shipper also sent this product very fast.
3144,"Nature's Path Organic Rice Puffs Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"puffed kamut is a really tasty healthy cereal. it is very filling and satisfying. it contains no added suger, salt, or fat. very low in carbohydrates and calories. would recommend it to everyone concerned about their health. great nutritional value, at a great price through amazon."
3145,Multipet's Look Who's Talking Plush Sheep 6-Inch Dog Toy,1/1,5.0,"I have the cow and the sheep in these Look Who's Talking dog toys. The moo and baaa are much nicer than squeeky toys and my dogs carry them everywhere. My little Border Collier mix is especially attached to them and spends lots of time putting them all together in one place and making them talk, so it's a cute way to see a little of his herding instinct at work. My dogs are not big chewers, so these work well, but any heavy chewers would distroy them quickly (although they are sturdy for a plush toy). The sound box is durable (some over a year old and still going), but does not last forever (one gave out after about 8 months of use). However, I can probably blame my stepping on them as much as over use by the dogs."
3146,Now Foods Ginger Std Extract,0/0,5.0,"I take a lot of different supplements for different health concerns, and have found that they ended up upsetting my stomach more times than not. I added the ginger root capsules to the mix, and I find myself feeling just a tad off much less often!"
3147,AquaClear Power Filter (UL Listed),0/0,5.0,I used this on the back of my 10 gallon reef. I easily modded it to accept a small amount of marco algae and a light to add to water stability. If you are interested in doing this google search
3148,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,I love this color so much! I got compliments on this color. Essie is a good nail company. The shipper also sent this product very fast.
3149,Bible Trivia Challenge Cards,0/1,5.0,I have fun testing my kids smarts;)This is a very fun game to enjoy with friends and family
3150,Melissa & Doug Upper & Lower Case Alphabet,0/0,5.0,This is a great tactile puzzle for our child. It helps with the process of learning UPPER and lower case letters at the same time. The illustrations behind the letters make it easy to make the connection between the letter and the associated image. Two small areas to note
3151,Terre D'Hermes by Hermes for Men,0/0,4.0,"Very nice fragrance.My husband saw ad in magazine and mentioned it...something he seldom does...so I was off to the Mall...no dice...so go one Amazon...there it was, ordered it and with my &#34;Prime&#34; it was here in two days! GREAT! He really likes it...not too overpowering...really nice."
3152,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this item for my 1yr old Chihuahua, Junior. His measurements"
3153,First Check Home Cholesterol Test 1 Test Kit,1/1,3.0,It took a while to get enough blood to fill it. I don't think I got the full reading because of the time it took to fill it. Reading at the doctor's office was off by 40.Instructions were easy to follow.
3154,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,"Wasn't sure the dogs would like the bed, since we have never had one before. Both dogs loved it, and even the cats join in. After I saw how they liked it, I bought two more."
3155,"Andrea EyeQs Oil Free Makeup Remover Pads, Ultra Quick - 65 Ea",1/1,5.0,"I can't live without these makeup remover pads. I can't find them in the drugstores anymore so Amazon.com has my business. True, they are a bit oily, but that's fine by me. They do the job quickly and thoroughly without drying my eyelids and surrounding skin."
3156,"Yerba Prima Bentonite, Detox Pint, 16 Ounce",4/8,1.0,Since when are liquids labeled in pounds? This is not a lb of bentonite clay! It is a 16 oz bottle of clay mixed with an unknown amount of water.I feel that it is deliberately misleading.
3157,Burberry London By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces (new),0/0,5.0,i dont go to the mall so ordering online is perfect. this is a great scent. LOVE it. Burberry scents are great
3158,Jergens Skin Firming Daily Toning Moisturizer,2/4,5.0,"So many others have praised this product. I've used it for years and it's readily available, though probably Amazon's price is as good as anywhere. Recently, however, I made an incredible discovery, quite serendipitously. I had ordered a liquid product from a home shopping network, supposedly to remove tight rings that used to fit fingers better, a difficult task as we gain weight or grow older. The product was a dud and I wrote a deservedly-bad evaluation on their web site. But the product gave me an idea. I use Jergen's Skin Firming Lotion on arms and legs after my shower each evening, so I tried rubbing some on my ring finger. Voila! With a little effort, I was able to remove my wedding band and solitaire with less problem than when I tried the other product, meant for that purpose. (By the way, hand creams hadn't worked!) I've done that most evenings, ever since. A closing thought"
3159,Facial Sauna Systems with Timer,0/0,4.0,Product performed as stated. Wish facial piece was larger have to turn face to get steam there but still great.
3160,THAYER Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner 11.50 Ounces,1/1,5.0,I have used this each morning and evening before applying lotion in the morning and after bathing in evening. I have not had any problems with it - the smell is nice and soft - not overpowering. I'm 48 and happy with this product.
3161,"Dove Pink Beauty Bar, 8 Count",0/0,5.0,This is the best price you can find on Dove soup. The service is fast. I would highly recommend it.
3162,Punky Color,1/1,1.0,"I ordered Lagoon Blue thinking it would be a light sky blue, like it used to be but much to my dismay, it was not even close.I applied it over a section of platinum blonde hair and thought it looked kind of crappy as soon as I started putting it on but I hoped it might rinse to a better color. No such luck. I left it for about 45 min and it rinsed to a disgusting, swampy, ugly turquoise. It looked like I had dyed it Alpine Green 4 months ago and just let it fade to this mess.I had my hair Lagoon Blue about 15 years ago and it was a perfect shade of sky blue, I don't know what went wrong.Waste of time. Waste of money."
3163,Omni Massage Systems Omni Massage Roller,0/0,5.0,Tried on like it in a birthing class and HAD to have it!! Gets in all the right stops and gives me foulness the time if my husband had to use his hands!! A must have for everyone!!!
3164,PoochPad for Mature Dogs,0/0,5.0,"After avoiding these for years because of the price, I finally ordered a couple and now I'm hooked. These do not leak. After flusing solid waste. I can hose off in the shower and they dry quickly. Occasionally I throw them in the washer and line dry in an hour. I've used the gamut of wee wee pads"
3165,St Ives Softening Whipped Silk Body Lotion 18oz,0/0,5.0,"I used to be able to purchase this in the stores, but can't seem to find it anymore. I was delighted to find it on Amazon & even though it came from another supplier & I had to pay shipping, I ordered it. I love it. It is one of the best lotions I have ever used & highly recommend it."
3166,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,This color required 2 coats to completely cover which is expected for white & it is the best white I have ever used.
3167,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,5.0,This has been a classic favorite movie of mine ever since it came out. My 7 year old loves it!
3168,Siege Chemical 766L Porcelain And Enamel Cleaner,0/0,3.0,"Not as good as the Phaltzgraff stone ware cleaner but it did make an improvement. If I could locate the Phaltzgraff cleaner, I would not purchase this again."
3169,Lyons Original Irish Tea. 80 Bags,0/0,5.0,This is a great tasting tea. You can add milk and it doesn't weaken the flavor. I saw another reviewer said that the tea has changed over the years and its weaker now. This tea was recommended to me by my Irish friend who has been drinking this forever and he hasn't complained about the quality.
3170,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,This color required 2 coats to completely cover which is expected for white & it is the best white I have ever used.
3171,Monoi Tiare Coconut Oil,2/2,1.0,"I've been using Monoi oils for as long as I can remember, there is something about the scent that is not only so soothing but it makes your skin feel like silk and makes you smell like the sweetest garden in the world.I love how I always get compliments by men and women wherever I go of how good and sweet I smell even if I forget to put some perfume on all day!I have grown accustom to the real traditional pure scent of Monoi flowers that the second I opened this up it made me sick and pretty upset to say the least for the so called &#34;Monoi&#34; scent.I will not complain about the oil freezing up because I did read it in the description prior to ordering so I was already prepared for that to happen.You must warm it up before every use so the oil can melt which does not really bother me because I always like to slightly warm my oils before massaging them into my skin because it feels so much better, but I will say that this specific oil looses its scent even more every time you heat it up.I would have definitely returned it but after warming it up, re-smelling it and going to place it on the counter the bottle just tipped over and 35% just poured out!I've used it several times since them to mix with potpourri or add a few drops in water and it has tipped over twice more which leads me to think that there is something seriously wrong with the design of the bottle since it won't stay straight the second you place down.I would never recommend this or buy it again."
3172,Pacific Play Tents Find Me Giant 9' Tunnel,0/0,5.0,"This tunnel was bought for my 9 year old autistic son and he LOVES it. It's long an wide enough to set up obstacle courses for bigger children. I'm 5ft9, 150 pounds and I have no trouble fitting through the tunnel, I'm too tall to crawl on my knees, but I have no trouble scooting through it on my back lol"
3173,"Per-Fit Briefs, Large, 18 Briefs (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"The staff at the nursing home have nothing but good things to say about these briefs. They are absorbent and the closure tape can easily be opened and closed again. We have seen a significant decrease in the number of briefs being used since we switched to Per-Fit, and you can't beat the scheduled monthly delivery from Amazon."
3174,"St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub Unisex, 1 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Honestly, I just ordered this product as filler so I could qualify for free shipping. But after we received the apricot scrub in the mail my wife thought she might as well try it out. And so far she has loved it. She says it is great at exfoliating without being too harsh/gritty on the skin.This product is great at removing blackheads and leaves your skin feeling refreshed. My wife says this product is a must"
3175,"TY Beanie Baby Gary the Snail, SpongeBob SquarePants",0/0,5.0,"It's GARY! Small, cuddly, cute, and SpongeBob's favorite pet. My daughter and I are having fun in all kinds of pretend play with it, and it's perfect for toddler hugging too."
3176,Cardinal Double 12 Color Dot Mexican Train Dominoes in Tin,0/0,5.0,"We love playing with Cardinal's double 12s. Mexican Train is a monthly party at our house, and to find the same manufacturer of dominoes as the ones we already owned was good. We are partial to the color choices for the different numbers, and are happy to expand our collection!"
3177,"Greenies Pill Pockets for Cats, 1.6-Ounce",1/1,4.0,"I'm so glad I found these. Our cat is asthmatic and we've been giving her a natural supplement to help with her lung problems, but she doesn't really like taking pills. When I wrap the pill with these, she eats it up with no problems.I read the ingredients, and I would not really call these healthy, so I try not to give her more than one a day. The problem is that the pills she takes require 3-5 per day. I found that they work well, even if they are broken up into halves or even quarters. There's no reason to use a whole one for tiny pills. I just break it into pieces and spread the pliable material over her pills. They last much longer that way and my cat doesn't get fat."
3178,"Truform Anti-Embolism Thigh High Open-Toe Stockings, Beige, XL",1/1,4.0,I use it regularly to prevent varicose veins as I stand alot at work.. Feels great. It seems to be effective.
3179,"Traditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,3.0,I would recommend this product. I have been using this tea for two weeks. It has a roasted taste and overall good product
3180,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",1/1,1.0,"I tried finding a sell by or expiration date, but couldn't find one on any of the packages. I tried using the lowest temperature I could. I tried allowing the popcorn to release steam when it was done popping and transferred to my popcorn bowl. I've never had to work to help popcorn come out crispy and fluffy. May have been an old and expired lot, but it should have been thrown out and not sold to consumers. Will not take a chance on this product again."
3181,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,2/2,5.0,"New neighbors with two untrained dogs moved in next door, spoiling the quiet neighborhood. I was skeptical of this device, but mounted it under the overhang facing over the wooden fence separating our properties. I ran the cord to an electrical outlet, so the device is always on. The first time after installation, the dogs set to barking, the device went off in the inaudible mode, and the dogs ceased barking and ran around the neighbor's pool, obviously confused. After three weeks of using the device, when the dogs come out to the pool area, they give a couple of woofs, and then shut up. A consideration is that the low-flying planes that skim my rooftop going into the air force base two miles away set the device off - audible screech - but as soon as the planes pass, the screeching stops. The lawn man's riding lawn mower sets the device off to audible, so I have to unplug it when he is here. Chain saws also set off the device, as I discovered when the tree men removed a downed tree after Hurricane Sandy. The audible screeching is not intolerable to human - not like ice picks in the eyes - and after the offending planes, mowers, and chain saws leave, the device goes back to inaudible without any effort on my part. I am pleased with the product."
3182,Classic Parcheesi Board Game,0/0,5.0,"I was told by a friend that this game was hard to find now. And if I did find one, the cost would be high. I ordered 2 games at a very reasonable price. They both arrived in excellent condition. I am very pleased."
3183,Beetle Juice (1988),0/0,4.0,"If you were alive when this movie was made, it is a must-have for your collection. I had it on VHS and finally decided to upgrade to DVD."
3184,Petego Pet Tube Kennel,1/2,4.0,"This pet tube is fantastic and works great for our dogs. We have an Australian Shepherd and a Border Collie mix (both 40lbs or a tad under). There is plenty of room for them, although oftentimes they lay next to each other, leaving the other half empty. They enjoy it and can still play and walk around if needed. The mesh provides shade from the sun, but is open enough so I can turn around and see inside to check on the dogs. The only problem is that they used a nice, sturdy outdoor zipper to compress and zip up the tube, but the end pieces zip up with a standard zipper which can be chewed on and destroyed. Otherwise it seems pretty sturdy and durable. It contains the mess in case one of the dogs gets sick."
3185,Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Sling,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love this product. So convenient for quick outings since my son refuses to sit in his car seat. I can run my errands just like I used to with no problems. My baby usually falls right asleep when I place him in this sling. I was initially skeptical due to the price, but I'm so glad I bought this! We use our ergo for longer trips, but this is the perfect addition to our baby gear."
3186,Lolita Lempicka Perfume For Women by Lolita Lempicka,1/3,1.0,"This perfume was suggested by a guy friend as I has been looking for a new signature cologne because my usual although I'm in love with (Ralph by RL) seems to be a little too young for me now. I went to a sephora and couldn't find Lolita Lempicka to smell it, so I proceeded to read rave reviews about it and finally ordered it. The scent to my surprise isn't worth the pretty bottle it came in. It's way too sweet, smells cheap and when I tried to gift it at work it was declined; I then gave it to my mom who also said &#34;this is cheap perfume, I told you to buy anything from Chanel&#34;, and gave LL to my grandmother."
3187,Doc Johnson Anal Plug,0/0,4.0,I like this product but it takes a bit of time to get it in. Once in gives you a full feeling but it can pop out if you walk around with it in.
3188,3 Pack of Da Bird Guinea Feather Refills,1/1,5.0,"The price for these feathers seems a bit high,but I don't think you could find them for less. The feathers themselves are good quality and my cat absolutely loves them. They don't all fly the same way ( some rotate better then others it seems), but you can usually adjust the feathers enough to get it to fly better and rotate more. Overall, my cats favorite toy. When he ruins the feathers on one of these, I take it off the wand and let him use it as a stand alone toy to destroy to his hearts content!"
3189,"Spicy World Almonds Whole (Natural and Raw), 4 Pound",0/0,5.0,"I only wish they also had blanched almonds at the same quality and price. Excellent size and condition, very fresh. I made a batch of &#34;Sriracha Roasted&#34; almonds for friends and co-workers. They disappear like magic! I blanched some to make almond brittle.If you have comments, questions or found this review helpful (or want a recipe) please let me know!"
3190,Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,0/0,3.0,"we purchased this for our 3 month old son and it was only about half his size so not really large enough to be considered a "" play mat"". we returned it for a refund easily and have no fault with the item. just beware that the mat is not the size of what i would normally consider a play mat as a 3 month old child is twice the length of this item"
3191,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,4.0,"Quick service and this seems like it will be a terrific crate for our needs. The second door is perfect. The tray came cracked in three places, but Amazon was willing to replace the entire crate or refund the amount of the replacement tray for me and I took the second option. Hopefully the second tray will be intact. Will update as the produt gets more use."
3192,Mutt Mitts,0/0,5.0,The best poo bags I have found. Excellent design. Thick base to prevent leaks. Would recommend especially for someone squimish when clearing up after your dog. Expensive but worth it
3193,"LEGO Green Building Plate (10"" x 10"")",0/1,2.0,"I read the reviews and decided to buy anyway, but these things really are flimsy. It's a shame no one carries the old, stiffer kind. Definitely measure the size, it looks smaller than you would think."
3194,AeroGarden Seed Kit,0/0,3.0,I wish we could have been able to make our own selection of the different seeds in the seed kit.
3195,Herrera Cologne by Carolina Herrera for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"Beautiful classic fragrance unlike any other from a recognized name. Been wearing it for years. Delivery prompt. Price was right. Compare, you'll see."
3196,Hi-Chew Green Apple (Display of 10 Packs),0/0,2.0,This took to long to receive in the mail. Once I got them they didn't taste very well either. Will not be buying this again.
3197,"Skip Hop 20 Piece 70""x56"" PlaySpot Floor Mat",1/1,4.0,"This is a great play mat. I didn't notice a strong chemical smell and I am very sensitive to smells. Easy to clean too. My only issue is that in some of the pictures the ""Brights"" looked like there was some pink in the mat but it is actually a red orange color. Still a nice mat and I am very happy with my purchase."
3198,World of Warcraft Series 1 Valeera Sanguinar Blood Elf Rogue Action Figure,0/0,3.0,"In the pictures for this product, the action figure looks like she will fit nicely with the others. Really neat pose, awesomely detailed weapons, and very visually stunning.Overall, the figure received was what is in the photos. However, the weapon broke not too long into ownership, and this figure does not stand very well on it's own. I usually have to balance it by leaning it up against other figures to keep it upright.It's possible that a later run of this figure fixed some of these issues, but when I purchased this 5 years ago, I was a little disappointed in the wake of the other excellent figures."
3199,Gillette Mach3 Cartridges,0/0,4.0,These are just like the store bought ones. I did not receive knockoffs. At the price they are a great deal for those who use this razor.
3200,Learning Resources Kitchen Set,0/0,5.0,My two year old still loves to play pretend and it is a good educational tool. It taugh thim how to use a spoon and fork!!!
3201,Bella B Tummy Honey Butter - 4 oz,0/0,1.0,I used this product from 12 weeks. At 34 weeks I started getting stretch marks. This product did not help with stretch marks. :(
3202,Goya Adobo Seasoning with Pepper,1/1,5.0,"I love this product and moving to California I can not find it any where. Most of the time when I revisit my New York state I bring it back home, I was happy to find it on Amazon."
3203,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/0,5.0,Great value for the price! Comfortable to wear around your neck for 12 hr shifts. Would recommend to anyone if they needed one.
3204,"Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics, 300 Grams",0/1,2.0,I gave this to my two mixed breed dogs and two cats. It made one of my cats throw up every day I gave it to her and one of my dogs threw up after every meal I gave it to her as well. My other dog did not physically get sick (that I saw) but he was coughing and hacking a lot which is very unlike him. I contacted Amazon and I'm returning for a refund.
3205,Fantastic Foods Falafel ( 12x10 OZ),0/0,1.0,"Hands down, this is by far the WORST Falafel I have ever tried. I have been eating Falafel since I was a kid and this doesn't even come close to taste to falafel. Please do not purchase, it is a waste of your money. I just threw mine away in the garbage. It taste's like fried dirt! :|"
3206,Andis Professional 26700 Styliner II Personal Trimmer,1/1,5.0,I've used plenty of product from Andis and the quality is always consistent. I've never had a bad experience. This a brand you can definitely trust.
3207,Panasonic Digital Power D Size Alkaline Batteries - 4 Pack,1/2,5.0,"Panasonic's digital power batteries hold their power and have a much longer life than when I attempt to use traditional alkaline batteries for my audio and visual needs, particularly with my digital camera. The 8-pack has outlasted similar packages of AA alkaline batteries I've used in the past, and at a more affordable price than similar lithium batteries.Panasonic claims that the battery uses high purity compounds to create a better battery. While I cannot speak to the makeup of the battery, I can say that I've been pleased with the performance of the batteries."
3208,"LEGO Green Building Plate (10"" x 10"")",0/0,5.0,"My son, aka ""LEGO fanatic', uses these all the time. He has plenty of project sets the are self sufficient (like the Star Wars type sets for example) but is always making additional scenarios and structures that make great use of the base plate. His favorite projects are building galactic fleet space ships from random bits and building, well buildings. The buildings definitely needs a base such as this to maintain their structural integrity...my husband claims they are a little too flexible, but my son says they are perfect. I consider my son the subject-matter expert and defer to his opinion. His other opinion is (I believe) that he would like one about 10 feet x 10 feet. Oh well.This is a great product for the LEGO fans when they start going off on wild tangents and building random things...it falls under the category of 'can't have too many of these'.HIGHLY recommended!JTG"
3209,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,Really glad I bought this. My ex girlfriend is a dental assistant and she highly recommended this over some sonicare thing that cost twice as much! It works really amazingly... I hate flossing and using this thing is much more effective and easier to deal with.
3210,Irwin Naturals Maximum Strength Phase 2 Carb Blocker,1/1,5.0,No more feeling over stuffed when I indulge in pastas or pizza. I use these throughout the week and feel that they do work.
3211,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"This tea I tried a few months ago for health purposes. I thought it was ok the first time, but after my second serving, I love it. This tea is very good for those who want a healthy drink because it helps lower blood pressure, boosts immune system, and flushes your body out. I love it because it is a tasty way of helping me get healthier.I recommend using raw unprocessed honey as a sweetener if you like it a little sweet."
3212,"JW Pet Company Invincible Chains LD Double Dog Toy, Large (Colors Vary)",0/0,3.0,"The dog loves it, but we can't let him have it unattended, as he could easily chew it to pieces."
3213,Dutch Blitz,0/0,5.0,"If you have never heard of this game, GET IT! It is my absolute favorite card game! If you like card games, you will fall in love with this one!"
3214,"Da' Fur Thing, Catnip, Fur & Feather Cat Toy",0/0,4.0,"The toy itself is nice. The fur feels real and the feathers are nice. I thought my cat would enjoy batting it around, but he seems to prefer interactive toys like the DA Bird wand over these &#34;self play&#34; toys. No knock on the toy itself, just my kitten being picky!"
3215,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,1/1,5.0,"I love these clippers. I'm considering barber school and a homemaker of just one son and these clippers made it easy to make sure my little man still got his head right on a budget(or lack thereof haha). My husband is tremendously picky on who cuts his hair and he allowed me to, Wahl got the job done. And good for the price including all the accessories. Love."
3216,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,5.0,I love this movie and have since I was younger. I am nearing 30 now and my fiance and I still enjoyed watching Beetlejuice again as adults. It's quirky and fun and worth a watch. I'd say fun for the family 8 and older. (My 7 year old niece was kinda freaked out at some of the ghosts/monsters when her Dad let her watch this)
3217,Marvel Legends Spider-Man Classics Fearsome Foes Figure Pack,0/0,5.0,This is one of the best box sets out there and there is so much to it I can't say everything except that its great! So if you want a l review check out my youtube channel JustSomeNerd98
3218,"Coffee Masters Flavored Coffee, Jamaican Me Crazy, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"What a wonderful coffee. I'm typically not very fond of flavored coffees, but this is by far my favorite that I've ever tried. The flavor is deep and complex, providing a bit of brightness upon tasting that smoothly transitions into a more complex body. The packaging is excellent, too, and the smaller packages with the air valve ensure that the beans stay fresher for longer.As with any coffee, storage and preparation are key. Store the bags properly, and be sure to grind only as much as you're going to use at once. Grind it fresh. Use a thoroughly cleaned coffeemaker. Use fresh, ice cold water. It's also worth the extra effort to warm the cup before pouring, whether by rinsing with warm water or by microwaving the empty cup for a few seconds."
3219,Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears,0/0,5.0,"I'm going to start by saying, five stars, five stars, five stars to both Haribo and Amazon for carrying these. I use to get my gummy fix by going to my local Costco but our store doesn't carry the gummies anymore. Target is good too, but they have the small bags and I want quantity. Hats off again to Amazon, thanks for stocking my favorite brand.For true gummy connoisseurs, Haribo has become my favorite for three reasons:1.) Haribo has great flavors2.) Haribo has good texture, that is a decent firmness to the gummy bear3.) And the green ones taste like the green ones should.These Haribo Gummy bears and the Haribo Giant Cola Bottles are my favorites. Enjoy!"
3220,Drain Care (18 oz / 510 g),1/1,4.0,"cleaned our drains nicely, great product..cheaper than hiring a plummer, everyone should try this product..What else can I say about this product"
3221,JR Mushrooms Coffee Extract,2/2,5.0,"I make a lot of cupcakes for personal and party use. When making Java Mocha cupcakes I usually use espresso coffee, but thought I'd buy this and try it. It works great, and to be honest it smells and taste just like Kahlua and cream de' Cocoa."
3222,Small World Toys Preschool (They Keep Multiplying!) 12,0/0,5.0,"I love a learning toy for the kids that doesn't require batteries! There's nothing to maintain, or break. I bought it for my 9 year old to solidify his knowledge of his multiplication facts, and as an added bonus my 7 year old is learning some too. Just a good toy to have around; it's a great visual. The fact that you have to press down on the key to see the solution underneath gives them a chance to think of the answer first instead of just reading a printed times table. Definitely satisfied."
3223,Doc Johnson Ballsy Super Dong,0/0,5.0,"Thick. Thick. Thick Fun Fun FUN! I knew it would be big, but I didn't expect it to be as thick as it was but I can not, I will not complain. Instead, I will do a happy dance"
3224,"Pipedream Products Anal Eaze, 1.5-Ounce",0/0,5.0,I enjoyed usual this product and it was not messy or over bearing to use. I recommend using this for your pleasure.
3225,OneTouch Ultra Blue Test Strips,0/0,1.0,"Based on the 1 star reviews and the question written two days ago that has not been answered, I will NOT be ordering from here! It sounds like a hit or miss and with the miss, it can be big.Thanks for the reviews, folks."
3226,Sojos Certified Organic Catnip,0/0,5.0,I have three cats and they love when I put this out for them to smell and roll around in. They get really excited.
3227,Kingsley For Men Wood Shave Soap Bowl with Lid - 1 ea,0/0,5.0,"My personal opinion, I don't believe that I would want to lather up in this bowl. Since it's made of wood, it willsoon become water-logged and the shinny finish will disipate. I purchased this product to store unopened cakes ofsoap, especially since it comes with a lid. It is a very attractive piece to add to your shaving collection.For what I am using it for, it is well made and very much worth the price..................."
3228,"PetSafe Freedom Door, Premium White",0/1,5.0,This pet door was easy to install and it gives our dogs more freedom for times when they need to go outside.Thank you.
3229,Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure,0/0,2.0,"While the service, packaging, delivery and seller are all impeccable, the product is no longer the same. ;-((. I have been an avid user of this conditioner. The old formula was MILES better. It is now MUCH more watered down, has a completely different consistency, color, and odor, and the way my hair reacts to this new formula is not they way it did before. Now, it really over coats my hair making it limp and greasy looking. YUCK. (Only use a dime sized amount too!)I have read other reviews about loyal, disappointed customers of KERASTASE speaking of this new formula and how bad it is now. It is too bad. I now think this is an over priced, drug store type of product.In closing, this is NOT the sellers fault. I have ordered this a few times and the formula (new) is the same every time I purchase this new formula. Disappointing as described.Sorry, over-priced, Kerastase, you have lost a customer."
3230,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,"I cannot believe it, but it actually works!!!! We have a terrier that barks at anything. A leaf on the porch that was not there five minutes ago will cause a fury of barking. Our neighbors new Christmas lights, more barking. He cannot help it. He is a terrier and he is our baby. His job is to tell us when something is different and he is really good at his job. One thing that is embarrassing is that he is so good at his job that when anyone rings the doorbell, he races to the door, barking at the top of his lungs, sounding as if he wants to eat someone up. They don't see his tail wagging and he is just so excited that someone has come to see him that he is beside himself. This is fine if it is strangers, but with friends, not so much. It is also embarrassing when repair people come to do something in our house. We got this collar because I had tried the clicker method, spraying him with water, speaking firmly, putting a thunder shirt on him. Nothing worked. I would not put a shock collar on him because, as I said, he is our baby and I am not going to hurt him. I got this citronella collar and put it on him right before my husband's best friend came over. It was a good test because my husband's friend always causes our dog to bark his head off. Our friend rang the door bell, our dog ran to the door yelling, was sprayed and stopped barking. He barked again, was sprayed again, and stopped barking. And he STOPPED barking !!!!! He would forget once in a while and would bark, get sprayed, and would quiet himself. I only use it on him when I know someone is coming over, such as a repairman or a friend. I like for him to bark when I don't know the person at my door or when I am not expecting anyone. He is, after all, just doing his job that he was born to do, bark to alert us. I highly recommend this as a way to control your dog's barking during those times when you really don't want him to bark. He has learned that he can just do a little puff bark and it does not cause a spray. That is ok. I highly recommend it and hope that it works as well on your dog as it does on ours."
3231,Weleda Deodorant Wild Rose,0/2,5.0,"who doesn't want to smell a little rosier? stop and smell my armpit, yo. you think your s don't stink? well my pits certainly don't. HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?"
3232,Melissa & Doug Food Groups,0/0,3.0,"I love the selection of foods in this set but many of the pieces already had paint-transfer marks when they arrived. Also, the paint seems to be rubbing off as we play (we just received it today) so this set just doesn't seem durable. It's a fun toy but just not the quality that I expected from Melissa & Doug."
3233,Aleph Bet Look & See Puzzle,0/0,4.0,"i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this puzzle for the price. I love how under each letter there is a picture as well as the hebrew word for the picture. I thought there would just be a picture so that's great. The only thing i don't like is that the hole for each place to put the letter is not very deep-the letter stays in nicely but for a two year old playing with it, i can see that the letters will fall out and potentially will get lost, if he carries the puzzle to another area in the room. My parents have a puzzle from the 80's where the area for each letter is deeper so the pieces don't come out as easily. but i am overall very happy with my purchase. the colors are very vibrant, the actual puzzle itself is made very well. I just wish that where you put each letter could be somewhat deeper. the letters do stay put even when the puzzle is standing upright so don't get me wrong, it's not like the puzzle is poorly made- the pieces do stay there. it's more of a personal preference. great puzzle! :)"
3234,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,4.0,"I have used Whey Optimum nitirition 100% whey gold for over a year and a half now. It is packed with protein and does help with muscle building and shorten your recovery time after you work out. I have tried the vanilla creme flavor and would say it's a 4/5, but stay away from the cookies and cream. The cookies and cream taste more like a coffee flavor and it's not that great; more like a 2/5. I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to build muscle because it does help out. The shipping was fast in that it came in a week and cheaper to buy on amazon than in-store."
3235,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,1.0,"First, the squirrels were too easy to get out of the tree, and secondly my dog had all the squirrels torn apart by the second day. I would not recommend this toy to anyone!"
3236,derma e Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Wrinkle Treatment Crme,0/1,3.0,"I used this item, wasn't impress, I know no product is going to remove wrinkles, but didn't notice any difference on my skin.I am better off for the price, to buy the cheaper product that I have been purchasing from my local CVS. I do have to say in their behave, they ship fast."
3237,"VAXA Homeopathic Medicinal Attend, Support for Attention Difficulties, Capsules, 60-Count Bottle",0/11,1.0,"My brat of a son, God bless him, he has ADD. I was not wanting to use drugs with devastating side effects to get him to pay attention in class and not make me want to beat him when he gets home. I gave him this and then he proceeded to rob a liquor store and get himself in jail."
3238,"Casbah Falafel, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,"Though the taste and aroma of this Falafel is wonderful, it seemed a bit crumbly. I think it would taste far better if it was a little less dry. I will have to play with it to see what I can do with the dry and crumbly texture. The regular homemade Falafel does not present the same problem. I may update this review once I am finished seeing what I can do with it to make it more homemade tasting and more moist."
3239,3-in-1 Joint Formula,1/2,3.0,"It smells a little like chocolate when I opened the bottle but it definitely doesn't taste like it. In fact, it's a little salty tasting. My biggest complaint is the size. It's HUGE! I had problems swallowing just one and the directions say to take 6 per day!!"
3240,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"I had read things about raspberry leaf tea and how it toned your uterus and eased labor pains, but I wasn't sure if it would work or not. I ordered this when I was seven months pregnant and drank 3 bags of it iced every night. I was planning on having a natural birth with no pain relief, and wanted to do anything that would help. When my contractions started I didn't even know I was in labor. The contractions felt like very strong menstrual cramps and were not near as bad as I had anticipated. I was in labor 8 hours and pushed for about 30 minutes. My labor pains were mild and I was able to sit and let my body relax through the contractions. I can't be sure that this tea is a miracle tea because it was my first baby, but I would recommend it to any pregnant woman. I was able to have a wonderful birth without any numbing drugs, which was a very empowering experience."
3241,"Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee, 16-Count Pods (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,Perfect hint of flavor with a touch of sweetness. The straight coffee varieties of this brand tends to be bitter so I really like this one the best.
3242,Brewers Yeast Tablets with Garlic,1/1,5.0,"I have been struggling for years trying to find a good flea product. I started with frontline until I realized that I was giving my pets neurotoxins that have been proven to cause seizures, especially in cats (yikes). Then I moved on to Program and Capstar. Program didn't seem to do all that much, and Capstar, yet again, another insecticide (yikes again). I tried all kinds of all natural herbal sprays (didn't work worth a damn) and read about every possibility, until I came upon this brewer's yeast and garlic idea. I knew that brewer's yeast was good for the skin, but didn't realize that a healthy coat actually keeps fleas away. I didn't have high hopes since I had little luck with natural flea medicine in the past, but it was cheap so I thought I'd give it a try. Well let me say, my dog and cat LOVED the pills and devoured them whole. My cat almost mauled me the first time I opened the bottle, which certainly beats shoving a capstar down her throat. Within a couple days, I already noticed a difference in my dog. He has flea dermititis and previously had little red bumps all over his stomach and a bald scabbed patch of skin at the base of his tail. Literally within two or three days the red bumps were gone and the patch of hair started growing back. They've been taking them daily for a couple weeks now and no more fleas. Haven't seen one since they started taking it. I was slightly concerned about the garlic content since I know that onion and garlic are not good for animals. However, I did more research and discovered that the studies conducted that discovered garlic to cause anemia in dogs used EXTREMELY high quantities of garlic, 60 GRAMS a day! I emailed the company with my concern, and they responded within a couple days saying that their tabs contain 1.9 MILLIGRAMS of garlic per tab. That's nothing compared to this study. This small amount is perfectly safe. So the product is inexpensive (yay), safe (double yay) and effective (triple yay!!) My flea problems are solved."

3246,ONA Liquid Concentrate 1 Quart,1/1,5.0,"I used this in combination with &#34;1 LB Water absorbing crystal soil moist&#34;, &#34;Paklab Primary Pail 26 Liter with Lid&#34;, and &#34;Honeywell TurboForce Air Circulator Fan&#34;. I bought it all from Amazon, free shipping, one purchase; just copy paste the titles into the search bar.The water absorbing crystals are a one time buy (once in a lifetime), and make the solution last longer.Drill a number of holes in the sides of the bucket about 3 inches from the bottom (high enough so that no liquid leaks out, but low enough to get air current over the solution resting on the bucket bottom).Take the fan off its base (simply flick the caps off the pivot and unscrew the exposed screws), and trace the fan shape onto the bucket lid with a sharpie. Use an exacto knife to cut the tracing out, and rest the fan on the lid pointing toward the ceiling. The power cord will go in the bucket and come out one of the holes you drilled.Remember, the more holes you drill the more airflow you'll get, but once you drill a hole you can't undrill it!On the bucket bottom, just pour in the entire bag of crystals, and a water diluted solution of this ONA concentrate. For $45 you just made the best odor eliminator you will ever have. Congratulations!"

3256,"Pet-Tabs Plus AF (Advanced Formula), 180 ct. (Made in USA)",0/0,5.0,"I used to give my cats Pet-Tabs, and now I give them to my dogs. I use the Pet-Tab Plus because I have a guide dog, so he gets a lot of work--no sitting by the fireplace for him! I think the regular brand would be okay for most dogs, even older ones. I see it as a little bit of insurance for their health, just as I take a multi-vitamin myself. This company seems to be reliable, and I've never heard of a recall. I've also never had a pet refuse to gobble it up."
3257,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,0/0,5.0,"Our cats LOVE this toy. Make sure you monitor them when you play with it because the string attaching to the feathers can get wrapped around their legs, neck, etc if they get too carried away. Like that the pole breaks down for easy storage."

3259,"Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream with Pump Dispenser, 1 Pound",0/0,3.0,"Vanicream isn't as moisturizing as I thought it would be; it's definitely non-greasy but it doesn't go on very well and absorb, you really have to work it in. I don't have eczema just really sensitive, dehydrated skin (not the same as dry skin). I think for dry skin, something oil-based would work better. Price is great so no regrets buying it, will continue to use!"
3260,Therma Moist Heating Pad,0/0,4.0,"I wanted a small heating pad to use on my lower back, this is the perfect size. I would have given it 5 stars but turning it off and on is a bit challenging. I suppose it's a safety feature, but you have to set the temp. and time to zero before you can turn it on and then set each control separately. The heat is nicely spread over the pad without hot spots. I recommend it."
3261,6321 Air Stream w/R-Mer 4.5',0/0,4.0,"This is a giant Styrofoam airplane. It flies, it's unusual due to it's size, and my 15 year old son found it ""cool."" You need adequate space to fly it, and I wouldn't let a dog (or even a cat that likes to chew) near it. We received the item in a timely fashion and had no problems with the transaction. I would buy this again as a gift."
3262,Melissa & Doug Horse Plush,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my five year old daughter for her birthday. She absolutely loves it. I was worried that it would not be sturdy enough for her to sit on so I tried it out before hand. If it could hold me at 125lbs, then it could hold pretty much any child. This horse is very sturdy, doesn't weigh a lot and it looks beautiful in her room. I would definitely recommend all of Melissa and Doug's products. They are great quality."

You can learn more about this fromtheir website. It is formulated for the body to use quickly.Highly recommended for those with FMS, Chronic fatigue Syndrome,or other similar health problems. It does help improve myblurry vision when taken regularly.A word of caution, if you come across a product that saysthat you may have an allergic reaction, to stop taking it;then don't purchase that item. You can't be allergic to iodine,but you can be allergic to whatever else they put in it."

The same product goes for $1.60 in our local Jewel. The flavor is great comparing to the PureProtein bars which goes for $1.99 in the same stores. Over the years I have had Powerbars PureProtein CliffBar, etc, this one tastes the best. Meanwhile, I'm always looking for something that provides a better protein/calories ratio. 20grams/240calories in this case is among the best."

I keep it in my bedroom so that he can sit in there when I am working in my room. I don't allow my dog to sleep over night in my bedroom but if I did he would be very happy to sleep in it . I am thinking about buying another one to keep in my office for the occassions he comes to work with me. One word of warning - the base is not waterproof, so you would need to line it with something if your dog is not fully potty trained.&#34;"
3271,Zillionz Talking Cash Register,1/1,1.0,"I was super excited to order this cash register for my two children ages 4 and 5, however, I was quickly disappointed when I realized I had received a piece of junk. The first cash register never turned off so the batteries died after about 3 days of playing with it, maybe a total of 20 minutes. I returned it to Amazon (wonderful customer service) and they sent me another one very quickly, only to learn that the second one was the same way. Now we have a cash register (second one) with no sound. This would typically be fine with me except that I paid $30 for this toy expecting a quality toy that would help my children learn about money, number recognition, etc. I normally do not read reviews before buying a toy, but please heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS TOY unless you are ok with it not working properly and are prepared to have very disappointed children (AND parents!)."
3272,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,5.0,"I had read things about raspberry leaf tea and how it toned your uterus and eased labor pains, but I wasn't sure if it would work or not. I ordered this when I was seven months pregnant and drank 3 bags of it iced every night. I was planning on having a natural birth with no pain relief, and wanted to do anything that would help. When my contractions started I didn't even know I was in labor. The contractions felt like very strong menstrual cramps and were not near as bad as I had anticipated. I was in labor 8 hours and pushed for about 30 minutes. My labor pains were mild and I was able to sit and let my body relax through the contractions. I can't be sure that this tea is a miracle tea because it was my first baby, but I would recommend it to any pregnant woman. I was able to have a wonderful birth without any numbing drugs, which was a very empowering experience."

3275,"Saco Premium Baking Cocoa, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)",1/1,5.0,"This hot cocoa is definitely one of my favorite things &#8212; the taste is rich and smooth...and oh so satisfying. A perfectly cozy, satisfying way to end the day, warm up from the cold, or curl up with a good book. I forgot to mention, that Saco cocoa both cheers me up and mellows me out. It is far superior in texture and flavor to even the most expensive brands. I like that it is unsweetened so that I can sweeten it to taste!"
3276,"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer, 1.7 Ounce",0/0,5.0,Love this..it's a great moisturizer with no smell. I'm highly sensitive to smells so this works great for me. I use it twice a day.

3279,"Nutrient Carriers - Lithium Orotate, 120 mg, 200 tablets",3/3,5.0,"I'm not ""diagnosed"" but I do have a type of generalized anxiety. IE when driving on a 5-lane freeway in the rain or in business interactions or social situations I can feel a bit overwhelmed and woozy, and then of course, anxiety about my anxiety. I can attest that this product does effectively turn down the volume on these feelings. I usually take one a day (recommended is 2) and skip on weekends. Since it builds up in the body over time it's effects increase. I can tell the difference between when I'm taking it and when I'm not.I also take zinc, niacin, a b-complex (brewer's yeast) and fish oil caps.If you are deficient in either of these you can feel increased anxiety."
3280,"Henry Dog 3""",0/0,5.0,"I saw the tiny Henry plush dog when browsing, and it immediately brought back memories of my grown daughter's favorite childhood toy. I ordered it for her Christmas stocking, and it is perfect. It appears to be well-made, and it is a faithful representation of the Henry we loved in the 70's. It arrived as expected, carefully packaged."

3283,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/1,5.0,"I got very fast delivery. The bottle size is 3.4 Oz which I believe last for more than a year. Smell is sweet and mild. Single spray under both arms on shits works for days. I need not to spray on same dress again. Smell last until next wash. I love this product, Price was about half comparing to store.I will buy it again."
3284,Redken Color Extend Shampoo & Conditioner Liter Duo,0/0,5.0,I use this product religiously. I tried to switch to another product for a few months just because I have heard that if your shampoo and conditioner doesn't seem to be working with your hair to switch it up.. When I switched to another product my hair did not seem as healthy as when I used Redken..so I can back and now my hair is starting to get back to its healthy self again. Yay!
3285,Je Reviens Perfume by Worth for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"As a nurse I'm very conscious of how strong my perfume is. I've had more compliments on Je Reviens than any other perfume I've worn. It's scent is subtle, but very nice."
3286,Kikkoman - Instant Tofu-Spinach Miso Soup Mix (3 Pockets) - 1.05 Oz,1/1,2.0,"I agree with the last reviewer, the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear. I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it, now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that ""powdered bonito"" is powdered fish. It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package, but on amazon it doesn't specify this. So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me.(I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago. I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants. Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies, so I do not know why this sometimes happens. It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well....In any case, I make it a point to avoid things like ""powdered fish"" in my food.)"

3288,Rainbow Light Men's One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,Rainbow Light Men's multi vitamin is packed with essential natural ingredients. There are claims of Natural Vitamins and how pure they are until you read the ingredients. Then you read Rainbow Light multi vitamin and see that it is only the finest ingredients with no extra junk! I would definitely recommend this and very good value as well.

3298,Clubman Moustache Wax,0/0,1.0,"I ordered this black wax because I have a black mustache and I thought that I needed the black one. Boy was I wrong! I made a mess on my face, lips and hands, even the sink was full of blackness. It didn't hold on very well either. Dont buy the black one at all, get the white one."
3299,Unger 92134 36-Inch Nifty Nabber Pick-Up Tool with Aluminum Handle,0/0,4.0,"This tool is sturdy and picks up coins off the floor. In comparison, the Gopher does not pick up coins or other flat objects (except paper that will crumple). But the Gopher is much lighter weight and easier to use (because the handle is perpedicular to the rod, which is not the case with the Nifty Nabber). And the Gopher can grab a can such as a standard tuna can, which the Nabber cannot because of the shape of the grabber part. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, the Gopher doesn't last very long before the screw threads that retain the rubber grabber parts become completely stripped. For people with lower back problems, it is useful to have both tools, as they complement each other. The trick, I guess, is to use the Gopher sparingly. We'll see how long the Nifty Nabber lasts."
3300,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,2.0,"One of my cats loves drinking running water straight out of the faucet. So much so that she doesn't always drink enough water if she has to deign to drink from a bowl like her sister. The vet suggested just leaving a faucet running. In the interest of environmental consciousness I thought this might be a better plan. Turns out one of my cats is terrified of the noise (its barely noisy she is just a scaredy cat), so I still have to use a regular bowl.The part I hate most is the cleaning. With the bowl I pick it up clean it out with a soapy sponge, rinse, refill and am done. With this I don't have a place super close to my sink so I usually remove the reservoir and the little lid that constantly falls off anyway and then carry the whole thing over. Unfortunately I am not talented enough to do this without spilling. Once I get it to the sink it breaks out into four more additional pieces plus the pump. Each piece has to be individually washed and rinsed and there are still a few nooks and crannies that I never feel like I can get clean. It a lot of time every weekend to spend cleaning a cat fountain.I have now replaced this with a different brand that has just the bottom piece the bowl and a pump. Its definitely less fancy and with no reservoir requires more fillings but its much easier and less time consuming to keep clean."

3304,"K-Y Intrigue Premium Personal Lubricant, 2.75 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"I got this from Amazon on the subscribe service and save a bundle this way over retail drug stores. This is a smooth, but not overly slick lube. It can be difficult to wash off, but using shampoo can do it or just leaves your skin a little softened if you leave it on. Overall, it does the trick and holds up plenty long enough. Just be careful because with all silicon based lubricants, it will permanently stain sheets making it look like a permanent wet spot. Go with a darker color sheet or consider using a towel to protect the sheet. The water-based lubes are more slick and don't last as long requiring a reapplication, just depending on your endurance!"
3305,Roofle Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,My Shiba Inu LOVES these as a treat. It smells and looks just like real waffles!Make sure to order from ALL PETS CONSIDERED. They are great and ship the order quickly.Thank you for offering this great product!

3307,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"My sisters like &#34;white diamonds&#34; and I wondered why they keep using it over and over, so I ordered some for myself and wow, how good is that.... Like Elizabeth Taylor a classy smell not too perfumish, not too weak. Just right to smell wonderfully clean and freshlike.Would recommend to anyone who wants to smell fresh and good. Now I know why my sisters use it."
3308,"Stella & Chewy's Freeze Dried Dog and Cat Treats, Carnivore Crunch Beef Recipe, 4 Ounce Pouch",0/0,5.0,"My Shiba Inu loves these treats, they're great for training or just a quick treat. Small enough to carry around and quick enough to eat to work for training rewards."
3309,Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith,1/1,3.0,This toy is a bit better than the cheaper one but I was disappointed with this one too. I thought the voices wereReally going to change. They did make an effort to change but not enough. It has 8 different voices but mostOf them sound the same. I read the reviews and ordered it anyway thinking maybe theirs didn't work. I guessThey were right cause my didn't work either.
3310,Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil,0/0,2.0,"I bought the oil and also the cream. The texture and the consistence of the products are really good, but the smell is strong and not pleasant."
3311,"Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Assam Breakfast Black Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box",0/0,5.0,"This is the most calming caffeinated drink I've ever had. It has the ahhhh feeling when you drink it. It's very smooth and wonderful tasting. If you like black tea and are looking to experiment, this is the tea for you. I first got it a Fresh Market and got hooked, this is my favorite meal time tea."
3312,K&H Pet Bed Warmer,0/0,3.0,"I'll go ahead and use these, but next time I'll get heating pads (which is basically what they are anyway) except that then I could set the temperature myself. Supposedly these automatically set to different temperatures according to a cat's presence but now that I've seen them I believe that's improbable. They are just stiff plastic sleeves with the kind of wiring inside that electric blankets have. Heating pads would be cheaper, better quality and I think, safer."
3313,PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,My cat has trouble keeping food down so has to fed in small portions. This product works great and allows me to feed her at regular intervals during the day when I can't be home. She has gained weight and is really thriving now. Would recommend this product without reservations!
3314,"Melissa & Doug Shape, Model and Mold",0/0,5.0,I run a small daycare and this is by far the favorite craft toy all the kiddos want to play with!
3315,SpinBrush Pro-Clean Replacement Brush Heads,0/0,5.0,These spinbrush proclean replacement heads are wonderful except that I accidentally ordered the wrong ones. I may as well just get the rest of the unit. The heads are uniquely shaped with different sized bristles for accurate and thorough cleaning. They appear to be of good quality.
3316,"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,4.0,"The big claim for these 'digital' batteries is that they are more carefully made than others so that they can deliver peak power over a longer period than 'regular' alkaline batteries. I checked out the Panasonic company site and the product specifications do not make any claims for hours of use...nor could they, since temperature and drain play such a great role in battery life. They do claim a longer shelf life and note that these batteries contain (I think 8) patent-worthy improvements over other alkaline batteries. Panasonic is a solid brand so I am inclined to accept their word for it. The package art suggests one use for these AA batteries is in battery powered toys or radio controlled models, applications with a high rate of drain on a stored charge. These batteries should extend play time or allow for longer use in flashlight devices that use 1.5 v. cylindrical batteries. My wife has a digital camera that takes these cylindrical batteries and they should increase the number of flash pictures that can be taken in comparison with 'lesser' 1.5 v. alkaline batteries. With Christmas coming up, having an 8-pack of these seems like a sensible idea to me!"
3317,Lionel Lubrication & Maintenance Set - 662927,0/0,4.0,I never knew a kit like this even existed until recently. All I did to maintain my engine and cars were wiping them down with a rag and 3-in-one oil on the trucks.
3318,Andis 13430 Platinum Personal Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I have probably owned at least 3 different nose hair trimmers. The ones I owned before this Andis were pretty terrible including Brookstone and Sharper Image ones for much higher $$$. I usually resorted to just putting my nose hairs out by hand. But this thing actually works! I read the reviews on Amazon and figured for the price I would give another one a shot figuring it might be marginally better than the ones I have used before. Anyway, what can you say about how a nose hair trimmer works except it either works or doesn't. And this one works!!"
3319,Tranquility 2114 Premium OverNight Pull On Diapers (small) 20/Bag,0/0,4.0,My granddaughter still wets the bed at 8 years old. These are great for overnight. They hold a lot of moisture and so far no leakage.

3321,Pet Carrier Fasteners - 12 Pack,0/0,5.0,Used it on a crate to bring my Corgi from California to Hawaii. We also used tie straps but the added security gave us a tremendous peace of mind. Hawaii is a rabies free state and animals that escape from their crates at the airport they are either captured and Quarantined or shot - so better to be safe than sorry

It is very lightweight and portable ( collapses to fit even a partly filled car trunk) , very sturdyand well-made. It can carry a person up to 5'4 in height and up to 250 in weight and seat them comfortably for transport.Thank you so much for this product. Our family loves it.!"
3323,"Clorox ToiletWand Disposable, Refill, 6-Count Packages (Pack of 8)",2/2,5.0,I have used this exclusively for a few years. It is a convenient way to remind me to clean the toilet. I keep it near the toilet and I don't have to go to another room to get toilet cleaner. It pretty much gives me no excuse not to clean the toilet. It cleans very well and I like the you don't have to touch the brushy part. Into the garbage it goes. Not eco friendly but anything that is for lazy people never is.
3324,Malem Bed-Side Bedwetting Alarm with Pad,1/2,5.0,"We needed a product that did not need to be worn by our child to alert them that they were wetting. We liked that the alarm could be programmed to not only make different sounds, but it has a way to make your own recordings. We decided against the loud manufactured tones and tried a few that we recorded on our own. We were happy that we had this option. You can adjust the volume easily so that could be adjusted, too.We didn't have any problem with the pad sensing moisture and NOT sensing sweat. It took a few trials the first couple of nights to make sure that the layers of sheets on top of the pad were just right. If you only use one thin layer, the plastic pad is not comfortable to sleep on and since it is plastic, will cause sweating. I presume that is the problem that the others comment about. We found if you use a draw sheet (one sheet folded in half) on top of the pad, that it was just right. Sensed urine when it needed to and was comfortable.If you want an alarm that sits on the bed, this is a great product."

3327,Manic Panic Amplified Cream Formula,0/1,2.0,"I'm a natural Brunette. I bleached my hair a month earlier so that i could go purple. I picked Purple Haze because it was the perfect color purple that i wanted. I got the amplified, which is supposed to make it last longer and what-not. I left the product in my hair for over 6 hours and it came out perfect the first time around. There wasn't enough product for all of my thick hair so i only did the under layer. During the first rinse i rinsed until the water was clear but every shower i took after that for the week after i could just see more and more purple come out. By the end of the week it had already started to fade to a pale purple. Half a week after that it looked more of a dirty purplish blonde that wasn't appealing.I loved the color, and i know that's it's only temporary. But i wish that i hadn't wasted the time, honestly. Or the money. Especially since it only really lasted a couple of days."
3328,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/1,2.0,"By the time when I wanted the size 3 diapers for my baby, Pampers swaddlers were not available and I had to buy these after reading the reviews . The problem with these are they don't have the wet indicator and the baby dry don't absorb the runny poop and it tends to just go right up the back side of the diaper onto her outfit and usually whatever or whoever she is lying on.It's just not worth the money saved! I will only buy the Swaddlers from now on. Hope this helps someone wondering which to buy Swaddlers or Baby Dry, DEFINITELY go with the SWADDLERS!!This is almost the one of the existing reviews."
3329,Melissa & Doug Monster Plush Bowling Game,0/0,3.0,A lot smaller than expected. Bought for a game at a birthday party. It is a great toy for ages 2-3. The ball isn't heavy enough to knock down more than one pin at a time even with older kids.
3330,Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 16 beans JR Mushrooms brand,2/4,1.0,"I ordered one pack and the beans smell nothing like vanilla. Like some other reviewers mentioned, they smell rancid.UPDATEThe return was processed the same day, and I am satisfied with that. I got a weird email from the seller JR Mushrooms & Specialties though. ""Because the beans you received are far fresher and better quality than the supermarket vanilla beans many people are used to, its strength can take people by surprise. Please rest assured that the beans are not compromised, and are fine to use.""Uhh... No. The beans do not carry a strong smell at all. Only once you hold them right up to your nose can you feel a dull, rotten smell. It feels like this is old product, but since there are no dates on the packaging I can't be sure."
3331,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,The colors and longevity are wonderful especially when using base and top coat (Butter London is what I already had for base and top and it seems to work well). I love each and every color I have purchased but am new to colors other than neutrals and light pink and China Glaze is totally addictive. I am having WAY too much fun. Amazon has amazing colors and prices in sets.
3332,Melissa & Doug Sports Balls in a Mesh Bag - Plush,0/0,5.0,"I am a huge fan of M&L and these pillows are awesome. Perfect accent for my lilttle ones new Toddler bed...and they are washable - sold! Hope they hold up OK, time will tell. My sons love them and roll/kick, throw them all around and while they can knock things over, they can't really damage much! The scale of them are pretty big - realistic, baseball is bigger of course than an actual one."
3333,"Duro-Med Alternating Pressure Pump and Pad, Gray",0/0,3.0,"The material and machine is well made, but it was not comfortable to me at all, and it didn't seem like the air was moving around in it.I used it for sitting on a recliner, because I'm being tube fed, and it was just unbearable. It might work great on a bed. I put down twostars, but I'm going to make it three, because it might be great on a bed."
3334,Japonesque Handi Jar Pack 4 piece,0/0,2.0,"It does the job. The product quality is great but the lids do not stay screwed on tightly as others. Its compact and great for traveling or carrying it for everyday. The bad thing is that for the largest case, i placed my power foundation and its a bit too small for that. i use the lid to spread the foundation and the powder gets stuck in between the screw lines and causes the container to become loose. One of the lids with a clear top, the clear part came off. now there's the use of the lid."
3335,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,5.0,"This is my first time purchasing these wipes and I am so glad that I did. They are fairly thick and clean up the messes with ease. The fact that they are unscented is even better, since my child has sensitive skin."
3336,Medline Elastic Net,0/0,5.0,"Great for bandaging large scrapes and burns. Without adhesives tape or knowledge of wraping bandages, that could cause a tourniquet affect. Safe and easy to use..."
3337,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,0/0,5.0,I have used a lot if bad trimmers and most don't get close a close shave without cutting you up. But with this one it cuts nothing less than perfect. I am a barber and my customers seem to be more satisfied with the way their line up comes out.
3338,Creativity For Kids It's My Life Scrapbook Kit,1/1,3.0,Not much variety or creativeness for the price. I went to Walmart and got one between 10 to 12 bucks and it had more pages and accessories included.
3339,Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover,0/0,5.0,"We have a 15 year old male cat who has arthritis so has difficulty walking. For this reason we removed the hard plastic litter pad for a softer and much larger piece of carpet runner under the litter box. Well about a week ago, he pee'd on the carpet pad. The stain was about 10"" around. I removed the pad and sprayed the pad till soaked and let it sit for about 10 minutes then I hosed it off with water outside and let it dry. Well the pad still smelled! Now I had used this product about two weeks prior on a smaller spot and it worked so I couldn't understand why this time it didn't! So again I sprayed the carpet piece till soaked and let it sit for about 45 minutes. I got two clean old towels, folded one and placed it under the carpet piece. Then folded the second towel and placed it on top of the carpet, then I rolled the whole thing and pressed down on the rolled to try and get out as much moisture as possible. I let it dry overnight and the next day, NO smell! I don't know if my trying to rinse it off with water made it ineffective or what, but I'm glad I didn't give up!I don't understand why it doesn't work for some people. Weird! Could it be something they are doing OR are not doing? One review stated that the name was sold to another company but not the formula. I don't know anything about that but I do know that this exact product does work. My original bottle was purchased in late October from Petco and it worked on several small spots. The 32 oz. bottle I bought more recently from Amazon worked as well!"
3340,Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,0/0,3.0,It takes some time to get the job done with this product. I am not 100% satisfied because it doesn't do the job neatly. As if not sharp or fast enough.
3341,VTech - Move & Crawl Electronic Activity Ball,1/1,5.0,My son loves this. It helped him learn to crawl as he wanted it and he now dances to the songs. This thing can take a beating too. It's a ball so my little one likes to throw it. I have tile floors! I thought for sure this thing would shatter but it's never even chipped. And he throws it all the time. I can't get him to quit. And he even knows how to turn it off and on by himself now.
3342,Country Life Genaslim,0/0,3.0,I heard about this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try for the holidays because I have a tendency of eating and gaining more during this time. The product slightly curbed my appetite. I consistently took it about 1 hour before my usual time to eat. I also work out about 2-3 days a week and my eating habits are not too bad. Maybe if I continue to use it perhaps it will be more effective but I'm not one to take pills for a prolonged period of time so I doubt that I will order it again but it was worth a try and realize everyone may respond differently.
3343,Max Green Alchemy Scalp Rescue Styling Gel,1/1,5.0,"I purchased this with the Max Green sculpting gel hoping that one of the products would work to give some life and body to my long, fine textured, thick hair. What a surprise when I found that they're both great. I use the sculpting gel on my wet hair after a shampoo and I use this to scrunch my dry hair. I apply it to the roots and brush it through and then I start scrunching (wadding handfuls of hair). Depending on how much I use I can get a wet look or just a soft wavy look. This adds the body and shine I've been wanting. No more gunky, stuck together hair. The big bonus is that it's safe and healthy. YEA Max Green."
3344,Coleman Windproof Butane Lighter,0/0,5.0,"Works as advertised, and nice quality. Seems very well built. I'd recommend buying this unit. Five more words seem to be required, so there."
3345,Air Tech Multi-Output Air Contol Valves for Aquariums,0/0,4.0,This is the best airflow valve i have ever seen! It controls the air very nice and the quality is very strong i like this alot 10/10 kep up the good work!!!! Worth the price. Please buy this item if you need it.
3346,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/1,1.0,I bought this color because black is now one of the new hot colors. But this black is dull and ugly. I made a mistake with this color
3347,Manhattan Toy Winkel,1/1,5.0,Toy is great for my teething 5 month old. Easy to hold onto and bite! Also soft enough for when baby swings it around and knocks himself in the head.
3348,Bvlgari By Bvlgari For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"An excellent perfume. Recommended to all. Great setting on my skin.Success olfactory, for sure. Traditional that does success.Sucessfull"
3349,"Pringles Potato Crisps, Variety Pack of Original, Sour Cream & Onion and Cheddar Cheese, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"Its Pringles, its like once you pop can't stop. Got here on time no problems. one piece. get em while they last"
3350,Thank You Desk Caddy of Coffee and Treats Gift Basket,0/1,5.0,"Coffee lovers will love this, it comes with a lot of specialty items and I know two coffee drinkers who are going to love thisThank You Desk Caddy of Coffee and Treats Gift Basket"
3351,"Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray, 7/16- Fl. Ounce Box",0/0,5.0,"haven't used this yet, but it's a no brainer. Lidocaine is anesthetic. i would guess that you just wouldn't want to go above the recommended usage because you may be working with a limp noodle"
3352,Petstages Cheese Chase Ball Track for Cat Toy,3/3,5.0,"Any cat caretaker knows that their pleasure is much more important than any mere human's. I am here to type a review on behalf of my cats. They offered to post a review themselves, but I gently explained to them that most Amazon customers simply are not sophisticated enough to translate lines of &#34;apjo 9uig -s0df-&#34; into something comprehensible to our small and insignificant brains... and so if they would please allow me to convert their melodious &#34;meows&#34; into the crass language of humans, I was certain that many other feline overlords would definitely be on the receiving end of this Ball Track. After further mentioning that they should not wear themselves out with the onerous exertion of typing, they agreed.My furry keepers have advised that dipping the mouse topper of this Ball Track into catnip (Yeoww! brand preferred) is a requirement for their ongoing pleasure. They have also said that they very much enjoy the minor challenge (VERY minor, my one cat assures) of fitting their paws between the top and bottom of this Ball Track so as to send the outer ball spinning around the toy. They appreciate the contrast between this and their other ball track toy, because the other presents no challenge to pushing the ball with their noses instead - should they deign to do so out of sight of human beings.They have also offered a bit of a warning to their front-clawed comrades (I'll note that we did NOT remove their claws - both of my feline overlords are rescues who came to us that way)... they worry that a clawed comrade might find him or herself catching their claws on the somewhat narrow center holes of the Ball Track when trying to bat the inner ball around. They suggest that human caretakers watch to see if this is an issue for their furred masters.My Lady and Lord have allowed that I may indulge in a very small piece of cheesecake this evening as a reward for purchasing this bit of entertainment for them... of course, the bulk of that small piece is first to be given to them as tribute, but I am grateful for receiving any treat at all, knowing how unworthy I am of such charity."
3353,Goldwell Kerasilk Rich Care Treatment (select option/size),0/0,4.0,"Good product however I have found one that may be better, only time will tell. Until now this is the best conditioner for fine hair."
3354,4'' Acrylic Equilateral Prism; no. LER2058,1/1,4.0,I had a beautiful glass prism that probably weighed a pound and turned the world magical. This is certainly not that! But it gets the point across and is safe for five year old. Of course....can't beat the price.
3355,"Pacific Chai Vanilla Chai Latte Mix, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I love this so much I am automatic renew so I don't run out. This is the most relaxing drink I ever had. It is just delicious.
3356,BRIGHT CRYSTAL For Women By GIANNI VERSACE,1/2,5.0,"Beautiful fresh scent that is not overbearing, I always get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it out. Love it."
3357,"Mars Chocolate Bars, 6-Count",0/0,5.0,"Hmmm, Mars... one of the best chocolate that I have ever tasted in my life. It is so soft and I enjoy to bite in it. The feeling of it is amazing. Usually I can not stop with one.:) After sport it is a great refreshment. I look forward to feel its taste in my mouth."
3358,La Roche-Posay Active C Anti-Wrinkle Dermatological Treatment for Dry Skin (30ml) 1 Fluid Ounce,0/0,5.0,I've used this product for years and Amazon has a great price. I love the way my facial skin looks and feels when I wake up in the morning after using it nightly. I highly recommend.
3359,Panasonic WES9064PC Men's Shaver Replacement Inner Blade for ES-RT51-S Shaver,0/0,5.0,Arrived earlier then projected and does what they are supposed to. Have been using the same Panasonic razor for 6 years now.
3360,Tuli's Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups,0/0,1.0,This will not support you plantar fascia. If you have plantar fasciitis don't buy this product. I am planning to return it.
3361,Elenco Electronic Motor and Generator Action Kit,0/0,2.0,"I used this with three sixth graders and a fifth grader. Not great results. Too complicated for the kids to stick with. I had fun putting mine together, though.:)"
3362,Fisher-Price Little People Animal Sounds Farm,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and she loves it! So far it is holding up well to her abuse. She enjoys making it make sounds, and I enjoy the fact that it is not too loud. I foresee a few more years of play out of this toy."
3363,Body Back Buddy & Mini-BBB Self Massage Tool Duo,0/0,4.0,"The big S shaped device is good for getting to some places on the back, but the knobs are often too small and hard (ouch). I wish they offered little balls that could be fitted over the knobs. I guess I'll have to retrofit them myself. I had one of these type things years ago, and it was the same problem. I put a tennis ball over the knobs and it was great. So, it still gets 4 stars because it's a good contraption for the purpose.The little hand-hook, which hitchhiked with my order of the big S, is a disappointment. The knob has a gnarl on the end that is just not right. I might file that gnarly thing off, which would make it more practical. It's not good for much of anything except someone with a tiny waist. However, I do think it will be useful for the neck area, once I file off that gnarl or fit it with a ball.So, I took off a star because of the above issues, which are relatively insignificant. Nevertheless, I wanted to mention them to help consumers who are considering the device, or as suggestions for the maker of these devices, if they ever read these Amazon reviews."
3364,Beer Bottle Caps - Oxygen Absorbing for Homebrew,0/0,5.0,"These work great! I have used them on my first batch of brew and they worked great, especially for the price."
3365,"Snyder's of Hanover Butter Pretzels Snaps, 9-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Arrived quickly, pretzels are fresh and tasty. These have been my favorites for quite awhile but are almost impossible to find in Wyoming. The price was okay , too. I eat them almost every day."
3366,Spill Proof Paint Cups - Set of 4,0/0,5.0,The tops close tightly so that little hands cannot easily get them open once I'VE decided they should be closed. The design of the place where the brush enters the container gives me time to grab the container from my son BEFORE the pain goes everywhere. The tight cap also saves paint. It's durable plastic. I don't see my son being able to break these any time soon. Everything about these is parent/wallet-friendly.
3367,Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil,0/0,3.0,I got this because of the reviews and the price. Ive been using it for about a month but I havent seen any changes in my strech marks. It does make my skin really soft though so Ive actually started using it on my legs and arms and found something else for my tummy. (Bella B Tummy Honey) But everybody is different so I wouldnt tell others not to try it. Especially for the price.
3368,Money Maze Puzzle Bank,0/0,5.0,"I was pleased to see the puzzle arrived in one piece, it was a fun & easy puzzle to do"
3369,Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner,2/2,1.0,"bought it in the store, came on here to see if I could find the leave in one...only to find they changed the formula. I am very upset. The new one doesn't smell as nice nor does it work. It makes my hair feel greasy."
3370,Game of Life,0/0,5.0,Love this game. Great family game. Always have fun for a good amount of time. Great game for family night.
3371,Lentek Ionic Waterless Pet Bath and Massage Brush,0/0,1.0,"Nothing replaces a good hairbrush and a good bath. The ionizer doesn't do it for my pups, too loud. The bristles need to be thinner and longer. will not buy again or recommend."
3372,Prof. Noggin's Wonders of Science,0/0,5.0,My 7 y/o is a big science fan & loves that he can learn about it in a game like this. He and his 12 y/o brother are able to get enjoyment out of it. It's easy to use on trips also because it's basically the cards & no board.
3373,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,"My son is very active and notorious when it comes to peeing. This diaper does not hold as much as the swaddlers does. It also sags a lot. Total waste of money! We switch toCruisers and its way better he can swirm, run, jump and no leaks even when he poop. I recommend Pampers cruisers for a very active boy."
3374,"L'Oreal Paris Vive Pro for Men Daily Thickening Shampoo, Fine/Thinning Hair, 13-Fluid Ounce",2/2,5.0,My husband requested that I purchase this because he can't find it in the store any more. He loves it!
3375,O'Keefes Creme,0/0,5.0,"Great for your feet. And, for tipping the ears of my collie puppy! Massaging it into his pliable ears daily , I have achieved what seemed to always elude me. Tulip tipped ears!"
3376,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Jumbo Cardboard Blocks (40 pc),0/0,5.0,"I have a 2-year old nephew who loves to tear things apart. I saw this product (or something similar) on the web when I searched for ""presents for kids who love to destroy things.""He went absolutely crazy for these blocks. My in-laws build structures with the blocks and then he knocks them over. He can hardly contain himself with delight when he does this, sometimes trying to knock things over when the first two blocks are stacked together.I can't speak to the durability as he hasn't had these for very long. And I'm not really sure of the educational value, though the packaging claims it has some basic educational value.All I can say is that I couldn't have hoped for a better reaction from my nephew when he plays with the blocks, so I give it the highest rating."
3377,Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,1/1,4.0,"I purchased one each for my 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter for road trips. I was worried they would not hold the weight of heavier items like laptops but they do. They work great for watching DVDs, iPads, playing on the laptop plus eating and coloring in. My kids love them."
3378,Twinlab Super E Complex,1/1,5.0,"My boyfriend started using this product about two months ago after I had read online that when used together with Saw Palmetto and Turmeric/Curcumin it has been known to help relieve the pain of Chronic Epididymitis, a very painful testicular disease.For the first month he started using this product only twice per day, and together with the other two products noticed a massive improvement. Within two weeks he was able to get out of bed again and last a full day at work. At the start of the second month he began taking the Vitamin E along with the other two products three times per day and now at the start of his third month he is practically back to normal with a full return of his quality of life.The dark glass jar helps keep this product fresh no matter where you store it, and having used other twinlab products before I can say that the quality is excellent, PLUS it's not synthetic, it's natural vitamin E! If you're considering using this product I would have to recommend it! We have been happy with all of our twinlab products so far. Great quality and value absolutely worth every penny!"
3379,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,0/1,1.0,"After 4 months of using the CHI Ceramic Flat-Iron I bought from THINK BEAUTY through AMAZON.COM the smell of electrical wiring/hot plastic became intolerable. The ceramic plates also began to make a crackling sound. I stopped using it and made contact with Amazon who responded that my return window of 30 days for a refund had expired and THINK BEAUTY never responded to my email. I called FAROUK and after I gave them the CHI iron information found on the inside part of one of the plates, they told me it was a counterfeit; therefore, it had no warranty! Amazon should know and they should warn buyers that some of their SELLERS pass on counterfeit product's with invalid warranties. Were it not for the smell and the crackling sound, I liked the way the iron left my hair!"
3380,Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs and Cats,0/0,5.0,Works wonders on my Maltese. Arrived in a timely fashion and as described. I have tried cheaper alternatives and none works like this!
3381,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"My dog pulls out the squirrels and plays with them, each squirrel has a &#34;squeaker&#34; in it to make it more fun for the dog. Then I stuff the squirrels back into the &#34;tree trunk&#34; and we start all ovver again. The quality of this toy is excellent and it is inexpensive. Hours of fun for any dog!"
3382,Egyptian Musk Perfume Oil,0/0,5.0,Would reccommend this to someone. Have got many compliments on the perfume. Thank you for such a great product. Ty
3383,"BSN NO-Xplode, Lemon Lime, 2.48 Pound",0/0,5.0,"This has got to be my absolute FAVORITE pre-workout supplement. I have used this product for years now and I absolutely love it. I was a huge fan of the original NO-XPLODE and just when I think they couldn't get a better concoction together they come out with the advanced strength. The advanced strength has some of the same benefits of the original mixture but they added Beta Alanine. I assume they saw the popularity of the pre-workout supplement Jack 3-d and wanted to capitalize on it. What you have is a new and improved supplement that get's you ready for the work out of your life. For every &#34;study&#34; out there that says one good thing about a supplement like NO-XPLODE I could find 3 others that say something negative. All I know is I get a stronger pump, a harder work out, and a better all around feeling when I use it so I will let the science guys continue the debate while I use this great product. I do caution that once you finished your 2.48 container you should take the same amount of time you were on it and take a break from it. I also caution you to not worry about the tingling you will feel after you take it. That's just the Beta Alanine kicking in and it's nothing to worry about! Good luck!"
3384,"Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning, Nacho Cheddar, 2.85-Ounce Shakers (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I love this stuff sooo much. I can't eat popcorn without it. I'm glad they don't sell this stuff by the kilo
3385,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",0/0,4.0,I bought this recently because i work night shifts 7p-7a and sometimes its very hard sleeping in the day time esp when you do not live alone or have a child. I put it on the white noise and its similar to a fan or AC sound.. puts me right out. Good product. Great price :)
3386,Tea Tree Ultimates - Funga Soap,0/0,5.0,This product arrived on time. Does what was promised. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of its specialty.
3387,"Replogle Globes Traveler Globe, 12-Inch, Blue",0/0,4.0,"This seems like a great globe for the price. As prior reviewers mention, the stand is made of plastic, and does flex a little under use. However, we haven't had any problems with it with our preschoolers.If you're looking for an old-school globe with wooden base and metal stand, don't expect to find one for the same price. However, if you're looking for a good, basic globe with raised relief, this one definitely meets the need."
3388,"Jerdon JGL9W Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification and 4-Light Settings, White Finish",0/0,5.0,"The Jerdon Classic Tri-fold Mirror was purchased as a present for my wife, but I also have found it to be extremely useful. It is great for seeing how to insert my contact lenses. My wife loves it too."
3389,Epakitin for Dogs and Cats (150 gm),0/0,4.0,"My vet encouraged me to try this product for my 17 year old Burmese Tom cat. She thought it could help maintain the health of my kitty's kidneys. He has had a hyper-thyroid condition for most of his adult life and has been medicated with 2 1/2 mg. of methimazole for about 10 years. The epakitin supplement is sprinkled on his food twice a day. I have been using it about 4 1/2 months and he seems to feel good and is active for such an old fellow. Best of all, he likes it and I have no problems at all getting him to take it with food. Cats are often very difficult when it comes to any kind of meds so I am grateful for the ease of dispensing. Also buying this supplement through Amazon is MUCH cheaper than anywhere else I have discovered. Very happy about that."
3390,ChocoPerfection 1.8 oz. Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bars - No Maltitol - Box of 12 Bars,0/0,5.0,"I love these bars. The almond and chocolate mix just melts in your mouth. You feel like you are cheating on your diet, but you are not. The only thing i would say is that I wish I had found them first at the online store way2good4lowcarb because their price is much better. You won't be sorry with these bars. They are delicious."
3391,Ultimate Nutrition Prostar Whey Strawberry,0/0,5.0,"Finding a whey protein like this one is a blessing for me. I drink it post workout(at night) and sometimes the next morning. Out of the 3 different ""natural"" whey protein products I've tried this is easily my favorite because I don't feel any bloating/indigestion and it definitely seems to be helping me recover from intense lifting as well as soreness I get from kickboxing/MMA sparring."
3392,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,0/0,5.0,"Easy to use, not smelly, natural, looks very nice and shiny once hair is dry. Not expensive and cruelty free!"
3393,Cinnamon Hot Chocolate,0/0,5.0,"We received this as a gift and thought ""Cinnamon cocoa? That doesn't sound very good."" But boy were we wrong. My children love it, and I will never go back to those instant packets that clump up and don't taste that good. This cocoa is delicious whether you use water or milk. My only complaint is that I wish we could buy it in the grocery store."
3394,Pro-Tec Athletics Knee Patellar Tendon Strap,0/0,5.0,"I have a couple of the knee straps. I do not have severe knee pain, however. Either I have a fat calf or these run a little on the small side."
3395,Dr. Bronner'S Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile,0/0,5.0,I will never buy anything else again. I love the soap and the companies values. They both are AWESOME! Definitely well worth purchasing.
3396,Dave's Insanity Sauce,0/0,5.0,"Be careful, this is by far the hottest sauce that I have ever tried. This is also the most flavorful sauce of its type...nothing with this much heat ever tastes good...this does. You will not be dissapointed."
3397,Premier Squirrel Dude Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,Easy to fill and the dogs will play with it to get the goodies. They got the idea pretty quickly that you have to roll it around to get anything.
3398,Maxell Micro Lithium Cell Battery CR2016 for Watches and Electronics 5 Pack,0/0,5.0,". Used 1 battery, working fine. These were purchased for myself and family members; hopefully they will not expire before using them. Highly recommended. I've been using these batteries and several other sizes with no problems."
3399,"Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix, 13 Bean, 29-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,Bob's red mill soup mix is really useful for the kitchen whenever you do not feel like spending time in cooking. Very tasty and fresh.
3400,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,Looked a little prettier in pictures I viewed but a good quality polish and I will use this again. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a grey-like color.
3401,Protein Bar,0/0,3.0,"This used to be one of my favorite bars, but not any longer. Earlier this year, think around the April 2012 time frame, they changed the ""model"" and made it a lot more ""hard"" and less tasty. They used to be much softer and tastier. In fact the last set of bars before they made this change were absolutely great and hence this change has been harder to take. Hope they change it back to what it used to be."
3402,Cherry Valley Feeders Bird Feeder,0/0,1.0,"I was excited about this feeder because it held a lot of seed, which meant me not filling it every other day. Well, I found it shattered on the ground after one week. The plastic is thin and cannot support the weight. A waste of money!"
3403,Fitted Portable Crib Sheet,0/0,5.0,I couldn't find anything affordable to fit my 5&#34; mini crib mattress until I got this and it fits perfectly. THANK YOU!
3404,Nair Nair for Men Body Hair Remover - 8 oz,0/0,4.0,"works great, you cant try to conserve it to make it last though..make sure you have a lot on your skin when you do it and make sure the rag is damp..as far as 2 weeks goes, you will be getting rough...works great if everything is done right, i would recommend..make sure to do a test area first and NEVER leave on skin for more than 15 minutes"
3405,NOW Foods Lavender Oil,0/0,5.0,I will order this again! I use it to detour flies around my outdoor trash cans. And it works well. Home remedy tip.
3406,Melissa & Doug Giraffe Plush,0/0,5.0,I bought this giraffe for my daughter's baby shower. It was made very well and exceeded my expectations. He stands very well!
3407,Learning Resources Woodshop Toys A-B-C Puzzle Blocks,0/0,5.0,"Quality of this toy shows sustainable materials that will last for all my grand-children. I am really pleased with this educational toy for children, I am sure it will stand up to repeated use. The wood is thick, and each letter has its own cut out to match with the picture. Even the box that holds the letters is well-built.My grand-children ages 3 and 5 have enjoyed playing with these alphabet puzzle blocks."

3409,Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer,0/0,1.0,The odor of this product is too offensive and I was totally disappointed. I cannot believe Oprah lists it as one of her 'favorite things'.
3410,Foil and Cutter for Remington SP-62 DA & DF Shavers,0/0,5.0,This item was for my older bro. I gave him a refurbished shaver & it needed the blades & screen.
3411,Burberry Weekend Cologne by Burberry for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,the smaller size lets me choose a variety of these products without make $$ comitment to one i may end up not liking.
3412,"Nylabone Dura Chew Value Pack, Regular",0/0,5.0,"These are regular Nylabones that are in the stores, but there are three for about the price of one. They're a much safer alternative to rawhide, and even my Pitbull takes a while to obliterate one. If your dog doesn't take to them, boil them in water for about ten minutes to release the flavor. That usually works. This is a good deal for 3 bones, especially if you have Prime."
3413,Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge,0/0,5.0,This is great for getting the conditioner residue cleaned off my back so I don't get any ickiness on my back. It's also great for reaching that spot that you can never quite reach with your hands.
3414,Living Intentions,0/0,5.0,These nuts are SOOO good! And the best part is that they are extremely nutritious. It's hard to not eat the entire bag in one sitting.
3415,Jenga - 2006 Edition,0/0,5.0,not sure why any adult would have an issue stacking jengas without an aide? My 5 year old does an exellent job building a tower all on his own ;) - the missing stacking aide is definitely not an issue here. We love the sturdy bin to put away the jengas. We love the game but also use the blocks for building - the blocks are precision cut and can be stacked any way you want it. Even my 2 year old has fun during the game building her own block towers/cities - one of the few games that the entire family can enjoy. So simple but also very creative ...
3416,Savogran #10763 22oz Ap Spray Cleaner,0/0,5.0,"I love this product and it is hard to find. I bought 12 bottles last time and it ran out recently - when I could not find the spray bottle in any store, I bought Windex. This is an excellent all purpose cleaner, but really shines on windows. I tried to use the Windex on my car windshield, but after trying 6 (YES 6) times with Windex - it only smeared the grime around, I found a battle of Dirtex on my boat with a tiny amount left and it was enough to spray on the driver side and I could clear enough of the grime of Windex to see through. That was it, I headed right to the internet and ordered more Dirtex. I don't know why Savogran does not expand on this product - it out does Windex by a factor of 100. You can find the compressed air can version, but the spray bottle is not on any shelves - what a pity."
3417,AstroGlide Water-Based Lubricant,0/0,5.0,"Works great. Not to thick, a little on the thin side, but it stays where it needs too. Doesn't smell. Works as intended. Would purchase again."
3418,"Fleece Hang-N-Hammock ,Colors may Vary",0/0,5.0,"My ferrets a requite picky, and particular, but they love the new hammocks in their cage. Jumbo size is the best. Timely shipping as well."
3419,Traxxas 5001 Fuel Filler Bottle 500cc,0/0,2.0,"...Not a big fan of this product, this is the second one that I have bought and the first one I had I thought that maybe I overtightened the cap causing it to crack and leak.Now being on my second fuel bottle I have been very careful whith tightening the cover...yes it did last a little longer but sure enough within a month of owning it and after about 5 refills the damn thing cracked and is now no good considering the last thing you need on your fingers and on anything it touches is NITRO FUEL!! all in all I would never purchase this specific bottle again considering I already know what to expect.No I would not reccomend this specific fuel bottle to other buyers.....very cost efficient product but look forward to buying another one within a couple months ....unless you dont mind nitro fuel on your hands and whatever you set the bottle down on."
3420,Braun 7040-091 Two Speed Power Handle with Timer,0/0,5.0,Exactly the Model and make that I needed.. Great Great neato great great great wonderful wonderful exactly the best of evertything. This is why I do not like to give these reviews Enough words are enough!
3421,Playtex Petite Electric Breast Pump,0/0,2.0,"It worked ok the first few times I used it, but it seemed to just keep going down hill from there. It's loud, slow, cumbersome to deal with the bag and bottle, and twisting the pump off to get lid on. I only ever used one side at a time, can't imagine the lack to suction had I tried to do both. And I really had to press the pump hard against myself to keep the seal. Thankfully mine was only a gift, but I will not be keeping it for next time. I honestly doubt it would still work by then."
3422,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #72, Lavender",0/0,5.0,"Doc Johnson Sex Toys are Fantastic!I Bought this for my wife and she just loved it, my only quirk is I wish it had more power!!You can never have too much power! LOL"
3423,Tweezerman Yellow Baby Nail Scissors with file,0/0,5.0,Started using it when my baby was 2-week old because he was scratching his face with his nails and the mittens were always falling.
3424,Summer Infant Complete Nursery Care Kit,0/0,4.0,It has enough items needed for baby. it needs a better pacifier for you to put the medicine in for the baby to take and a softer noise syringe in order to use it for suction of the nose
3425,LACOSTE POUR HOMME For Men By LACOSTE Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Este art&iacute;culo es muy bueno, yo qued&eacute; muy satisfecho con &eacute;sta compra, creo que la relaci&oacute;n costo-beneficio es excelente, por lo tanto recomiendo este producto."
3426,"Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed, 610 mg",0/0,5.0,This product really helped lower my type 1 diabetes blood sugar up to 100 mg/dl depending on the food eaten or the length of time between a meals. Awesome stuff. Not just for type 2 diabetics.

3430,"Futuro Tennis Elbow Support (w / tension pad), One Size/ADJ, Black, 1 Support (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,"Best yet. I have used 2 other designs. Don't be afraid to use 2, as you can always give it to someone else. I use it only when playing tennis. Easiest yet to use.I believe however that the best solution is a tennis instructor who will correct your incorrect technique, in combination with using this -this item. Tom"
3431,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Montauk The End,0/0,5.0,"It was a gift, so I cant tell much about the product. But the girl who received it was quite happy."
3432,Diamond Chicken Flavor Dry Dog Food for Puppy,0/0,4.0,"my dog loves the diamond brand, its the best quality food for an affordable price and sense i have a BIG dog affordability is important. i want to keep her healthy and well fed and now i can do that with out going broke"
3433,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,0/0,5.0,"This is a wonderful invention! I love the fact that one can draw with chalf on the blackboard and paint on the paper which can be replaced. My grandchild has spent endless hours with this and I believe it's a great tool for a child to explore their artistic side! It will, possibly, give her an interest in art for the future. I would highly recommend it."
3434,Evenflo Jump Up,0/0,5.0,"I am babysitting a very ""fussy"" 4 month old...I purchased this hoping she would like it...so loves it!!! It's well made also. The one downfall is it will only go on certain door frames, lucky for me my daughters home where I babysit has old door frames, it would never work here in my home."
3435,Alpha Hydrox Oil-Free Formula (1.7 oz / 50 ml),0/0,4.0,"I have mild acne on my chest and back. Combining this with acne meds and a moisturizer seems to combat pimples without dryness. The only con for this product is that is a bit runny. The product always get caught in the cap, which is not that sanitary."
3436,Spike Training Collar,0/0,5.0,"I bought this collar for my 6 month old German Shepherd who is about 60lbs. It only took him a couple of minutes to adapt to the new collar and the results were immediate. He is a great dog who does pretty well on a leash but he often attempted to chase squirrels, stray cats, and sometimes the occasional car. He simply stopped pulling!! He sees something like a cat, gets excited like usual, but that's it. The instant he would ordinarily pull, he just doesn't... I am beyond pleased :)"
3437,Carlson Labs Norwegian Cod Liver Oil,0/0,5.0,"If you have a hard time taking unflavored cod liver oil due to the taste, this is for you. I can't detect any bad flavor at all and it actually has a very pleasent lemon flavor."
3438,Gourmet Entree Moist Cat Food Half Case 12 Cans,0/0,1.0,"Tried gradually introducing this in with his favorite foods including yogurt in a 1:3 mix. Kitty never really liked it. I then tried full strength-still no effect. I am now left with 11 unused cans. Plus, these are really large cans and I don't see my portly 11-pound kitty eating even quarter of this can at any one time (even he took a liking to it). Which means you will have to store this in a refrigerator until the second use. The first can I opened gathered mold when I left the half empty can in the closet."
3439,Regalo My Chair Portable Booster,0/0,5.0,"I almost didn't buy this chair because the price was so good I thought there must be something wrong with it. I'm so glad I purchased this over a bulky plastic booster seat. Even the fabric ""my little seat"" only works over specific types of chairs. The Regalo portable chair is lightweight, and folds up small so it hardly takes up any room in a suitcase. It's also great for the beach, the park, and at home. It comes with a fabric cover and is able to strap securely to a chair to hold it in place. You can also buckle up your child in if you have a wiggle worm like me. I bought it for our 15 month old who's now 2 and we still use it."
3440,Testors Promotional Enamel Paint Set,0/0,5.0,"the colors are great for painting your figures and models. whether you are a beginners or a professional, this product is great and easy to use. recommend for everyone."
3441,Alba Botanica Very Emollient Bath & Shower Gel,0/0,5.0,A light refreshing smell. Good lather. It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money.
3442,Sesame Street Wipes Travel Case (Each item is sold individually),0/1,4.0,"This case is sturdy and holding up over time, but I also see it as unnecessary considering half of the time I forget it and use a baggie anyway. Hold enough wipes for a day, but I think I'd prefer to not refill it after each day of outings."
3443,Zinc for Acne 100 Tablets,2/2,5.0,"i have BAD acne, and when i say bad acne i mean i looked hideous.i tried creams but they never worked, a friend of mine gave me 10 of these tablets (he purchased them about three weeks ago) told me the instructions, i took the and my face improved about 90%!i was skeptical since it is &#34;natural&#34; but it sure as hell works well.it is currently at UPS shipping center, can't wait for it to get here."
3444,Pillow Dog Bed Dog Novelty Pattern 30 X 40 X 6,0/0,5.0,"I kennel my dogs at night when they go to bed. I've tried tons of different beds that fit into the kennels...and usually my dogs chew them up, or scrunch them out of the way. For whatever reason, this bed hasn't gotten that treatment. Also, it is well made, yet soft. Bottom line is that the dog is happy, so I'm happy!"
3445,Melissa & Doug Stack and Sort Board,0/0,5.0,"My 1 yr old got this for XMAS, she played with it literally for 20 minutes, half and hour at a time, huge for that age, really. Still plays with is on occasion at 2.5. Only thing was, she could do the colors correctly from the very first time, but she still enjoyed it."
3446,Drinking Bird,0/0,5.0,"Old, old toy, fascinating for kids of all ages. Water evaporates and fluid shifts in a glass tube that is sealed. Simple hydraulics causes the bird to dip his beak for a drink in a smal lglass of water. Simple to operate, a child of three can learn to set it up with adult supervision once or twice. Long lasting gizmo. Kept my cat hypnotized for hours."
3447,NOW HYALURONIC ACID Double Strength - 100 MG - 60 Vcaps,0/0,2.0,"This came highly recommended, but I am not getting relief with a torn rotator cuff. I'm taking with glucosamine & condroitin, MSM and high doses of vitamin C. Do you have any experience with this? Recommendations?"
3448,"Revolution Tea English Breakfast Black Tea, 16-Count Teabags (Pack of 6)",1/1,5.0,"I had to buy a whole case of it from Amazon, but its very good.I like the flow through bag, but, I haven't tested to see if it makes a difference in the flavor. One interesting anecdote"
3449,Olay Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream,1/1,1.0,"This was a great price. The saying goes, you get what you pay for. This package came in pretty rough condition. Even looked a little dirty! The bottle was backwards in the packaging. Well I used it. After a little while my face was all broken out! I've used this for years, I still do. I threw this stuff out!!! Whether this was counterfeit or tampered with, I don't know. DON'T buy this! Buy it at the store!!"
3450,Source Naturals Yerba Mate 600mg,0/1,5.0,I heard about the beneficial properties of Yerba Mate and so purchased the tea and also these pills. The pills are for when I am on the run and don't have time to brew a good cup.
3451,"Merrick 7-9"" G.I. Bone (12 Count)",0/0,5.0,"My lab is still chewing her bone, pulling it out frequently, after 2+ months. It's been outside, at first to get the greasy part chewed off, and now resides in the house. Since she is only a year, and an avid chewer, I was a little hesitant due to the price. It is worth every penny! A great product for sure!"
3452,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"It was a gift, so I cant tell much about the product. But the girl who received it was quite happy."
3453,"Bath Gel, Honey Mango 2oz.",0/0,5.0,A light refreshing smell. Good lather. It lasts a very long time overall a very good buy for the money.
3454,Horse-Opoly Board Game by Late For The Sky,0/0,5.0,Enjoyed this game very much! For horse lovers it's a fun version of monopoly. Highly recommend! Would be a great Christmas present!
3455,Source Naturals L-Arginine L-Citrulline Complex,2/2,5.0,this is the only way to really benefit from nitrous oxide producing supplements. You have to take a high dose and it works best when combined with L-Citrulline. Such big pills. Have to take them one at a time.
3456,Kushies Zolo Boa,0/0,5.0,I got this for a baby shower several years and the baby loved it. The rings are great and more interactive than your usual stacking rings.
3457,Ponaris Ponaris Nasal Emollient,0/0,4.0,"I have had very severe dry nose for the past 4+ years ever since I had sinus surgery. The past winter was so uncomfortable that I was miserable for months. I've tried everything - Vaseline, neosporin, vick's vaper rub, some other nose gel I got on Amazon, saline spray/gel/etc, and a sesame oil concoction. Nothing has worked long term for me. I did some research and learned that I should never use vaseline/neosporin/vick's because it can be ingested and cause some type of pneumonia so that is when I learned about the different oils that can go up your nose. It is kind of gross, but this one seems to work for the most part. I still have to put it up my nose every night. I wish it would actually heal the problem so I would not have to do this for the rest of my life. I'll take it for now! :)"
3458,Trojan Variety Pack Condoms,0/0,4.0,Nice assorted selection. Would buy again if I would ever use all of these. You get to decipher what particular style you prefer.
3459,Marina 3-Inch Blue Fine Nylon Net with 10-Inch Handle,1/1,5.0,We have a small fish bowl for our beta and this works perfectly to fish him out. Quality seems pretty good as well.
3460,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,4.0,"I got these to get that movie theater quality popcorn taste and boy does it come close. I love that the ingredients are included in the single pack, instead of having to purchase oil and popcorn separately. I did add Flavacol and Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping as well to get even closer to that movie theater taste.I cook mine in a Whirley Pop and it works well. I think to get true movie theater flavor you have to cook it in a true popcorn popper with the kettle that dumps the popcorn right after popping it. I think that on the stove you lose some flavor as the popcorn stays in the kettle and is subject to additional heat and moisture after it pops.All in all the packaging is nice and easy to use. I just wish they had an easier tear option at the top. Usually I cut open the oil side with scissors and dump it in the Whirley Pop first to melt it. Then I cut open the remainder of the package and dump the contents in when the temp is good. Generally I get a consistent batch, but every now and then I get a batch that is either too crunchy or a little too sticky. I am not sure if that is the fault of this product or my cooking methods."
3461,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"Its a great, bright red. Good as a holiday color but its red so it really works at any time of year. Looks very classy. Is a little streaky on the first coat but looks great after a second!"
3462,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,2.0,I bought this hoping it would reduce my allergy symptoms but it did not. I also do not like the taste of this tea.
3463,Aleph Bet Adventure Board Game,0/0,5.0,"We love this game! I bought it for my 5 year old who doesn't know Hebrew yet, but is starting to learn her letters. She loves playing this game as a nice variation to Candy Land and I love playing it with her. We are writing our own list of what the words are that start with the various letters. A great buy!"
3464,"Alessi Thin Breadsticks, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,These are very crunchy breadsticks perfect for a small snack or compliment for dinner. You usually get about 7 to 9 breadsticks per packet which is plenty and leaves you satisfied. These are breadsticks recommended as part of the HCG diet and allow you a card indulgence. The thin flavor is a bit bland compared to the rosemary flavor but still good when paired with more spicy or full flavored foods.
3465,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap,0/0,3.0,"Had an older incontinent dog. We had to use adult human protection pads to keep this from being a waste of effort. We had to buy two more wraps to allow for washing the wraps as there was leakage from the pads. The elastic on one of the three wraps broke after just a few washes. However, it allowed our old guy a few more months of living with the family even though he was unable to hold his urine."
3466,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,4.0,"I'd give it a 5 if it had more weight to it but as is it slides around too easily. That said this is a great bed. The material is breathable and easy to clean. My dog loves going to bed at night too! He jumps right up, curls up and passes out. He's never been tempted to chew on it either which has always been an issue with typical dog beds/mats. Now I just need to buy another one for my other dog. This is a solid product."
3467,Liz Claiborne Curve Cologne Spray,0/0,5.0,Smells great!!!! when he smells good the whole houses smells good that is great. good value last a long time.
3468,"Super Pet Giant Rabbit Igloo Hideout, Colors Vary",0/0,1.0,Very disappointed in product. The measure height by the knobs on top & width by outer edge of door. Not worth the money for a cheap piece of plastic. I know it says colors vary but the green one I received is a horrible color. I called customer service and not much help. Told me to send it back but I might get th same color again.
3469,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"Zoya's Daul has really received a bad rap in the beauty blogsphere because of the color and opaqueness (they argue it's too sheer), but I never had any issues with this product. It's not a one-coater; I usually need two good coats to make it fully opaque. And I absolutely disagree that Daul isn't a good color--I think it's extremely beautiful. It's a light purple shade with flecks of gold, which shimmers in the light and make your nails looks metallic. Oh so pretty.This nail polish dries pretty fast and lasts for a long time, especially if you use a top coat. I'm currently wearing it on my nails and it's been on for a week with no chipping.As for dupes, there are plenty, but none less expensive. I know Julep recently released one, but it's more expensive.So overall...love! :)"
3470,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,2.0,"I have had this fountain for almost 2 months now, and my cat still hasn't used it. I know it says it may take time for animals to get used to it, but Im beginning to think this was not a good buy. My cat continues to drink out of his regular bowl, and will wait for his regular bowl even if he is thirsty. Im not saying its not a good product, but in my case my cat is either too picky or scared to drink out of it. Out of my experience, I give it two stars for being nothing but a cute decorative fountain."
3471,Cascade Canister Filter Pumps for Fresh & Saltwater Aquariums - UL Listed,0/0,5.0,"T works like a dream, setup was easy and the directions were easy to follow. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly."

3474,"Wellements Organic Gripe Water for Colic, 4 Fluid Ounce",0/1,1.0,I didn't notice any difference in my baby when using this product. My pediatrician says they don't recommend it b/c nobody really knows what is in it.

3477,Precision Pet Ultimate Exercise Pen,0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased this gate from Petco.com thinking I got a great deal. Instead it ended up being on backorder for 2+ months and I was back at square one. Then I found it here and I got it just 2 DAYS LATER!!!!!! It's worked exactly how we needed it. We've attached it to our dog's crate so he has a bigger space to play around in while we're at work.The human walk thru gate works well for us to go in and out. There is a decent sized threshold though, so our dog (mini-dauchshund) has a hard time getting in and out of the human door. Instead he just uses his own little crate door instead."
3478,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"Zoya's Daul has really received a bad rap in the beauty blogsphere because of the color and opaqueness (they argue it's too sheer), but I never had any issues with this product.

3479,Lancome Confort Galatee Dry Skin,0/0,5.0,This is simply the best cleanser. I wear a lot of make-up and it cleans my face without drying it out like most cleansers do - even when they say they are formulaed for dry skin. It is a bit pricey but worth it.
3480,Bioderma Crealine H2o Ultra-mild Non-rinse Face and Eyes Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"This is wonderful.. love it removes my falsh lashes and does so without burning or skin redness. I love this.. I must say, I owe a lot of what I buy to Lisa Elderidge, she researches and tell you what to expect, and so far, she has not led me wrong with the products, either high priced or highstreet as she calls them..WE in America call them Drugstore or makeup counters.. lol thanks Lisa and for the chance to say, everyone that uses make on a daily routine, needs this.. I make sure since I am oily only in the T-zone to stay clear of my scalp area in winter, it will dry it out.. but don't mind since I produce so much oil over night. It's amazing in the am just to rub in on my face to cleanes the overnight moisturizer and have skin ready to clean with a gentle cleaner.. thanks Bioderma."
3481,Inns and Cathedrals,0/0,5.0,Inns and Cathedrals is a great addition to the Carcassone product line. I love this expansion and use it every time I play.
3482,HABA-Fantasy Land Building Blocks,0/0,5.0,Haba makes amazing products! The paint does not chip and you do not have to worry about lead paint. They are more expensive than other block sets but most are made in Germany. They are great wooden products I think allow the kids to be creative.
3483,Asset Eyewear Reading Glasses - Round Tortoise,0/0,5.0,I bought these in addition to other pairs I have of another style and these fit really well without being too tight and work great for reading glasses. I do a lot of computer work and these glasses are my favorite.
3484,Whitmor 6187-2419 Dryer Balls Set of 2,0/0,1.0,I have used dryer balls before and needed new ones. So I ordered these and within a few weeks I keep finding little pieces of the ball in the dryer. They continue to lose their little spikes on the balls. My last balls lasted for years these are ready for the garbage. I can't return them as the window for return expired and it's only been a few months. I would not buy these again!!!
3485,Accu-chek Multiclix 200+4 Lancets - 204 Ea,0/0,5.0,It is great having cartridge that hold 6 lancets and you do not need to worry about sticking yourself accidentally. Very low pain or no pain sometimes!
3486,Bags on Board Regular Bag Refill Pack,0/0,2.0,They changed in how you separate bags and on numerous occasions they bags tore apart so they were unusable. Probably would not purchase again.
3487,Regalo HideAway Bedrail,0/1,3.0,This doesn't work for me because my daughter has a bunk bed so the little rail that holds the mattress in blocks it from folding down and sliding under the mattress. I am not really able to use it as intended.
3488,Freeman Freeman Facial Clay Mask Feeling Beautiful Avocado & Oatmeal,1/1,4.0,This mask took away my redness and my skin is sooo free and airy! Its so refreshing. BUT I bought this product from an Ulta nearby but could've bought it from Walmart etc. for WAY LESS. I got it for $3.99.
3489,J.L. Childress Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag,0/0,3.0,"I should have gone with something that rolls. I can squeeze (I mean SQUEEZE, the zippers are very strained) my Britax Advocate CS 70 into, but it is so awkward and heavy to wear as a backpack. It makes me feel like a pack animal."
3490,Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth By Apex Healthcare Products,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this cloth after buying a junky microfiber cloth at a big box store. I simply ran my glasses under water, scrubbed with my fingers, and then wiped it clean with the cloth. The results were fantastic. My glasses were as clean as the day I purchased them. I've washed the cloth twice in the laundry and it's held up great."
3491,Urban Decay Eyeshadow,0/0,5.0,"I JUST ORDERED THIS ON FRIDAY, AND I ALREADY HAVE THE PRODUCT TODAY! IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THAT!! GREAT SERVICE AND WONDERFUL PRODUCT!"
3492,"Source Naturals Green Coffee Extract, 500 mg",0/0,4.0,"I have hypothyroidism, work out 6 days a week and eat healthy.I have a hard time losing weight, even eating tiny portions or juicing!BUT, I took this for a month and did nothing different and lost 3 pounds, continued for another month and lost 2 more = 5 lbs. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but for me that is huge! Here is the BUT BE careful....I suddenly started having heart palpatations and high heart rate on even 1 pill a day. I HAVE NOT GAINED THE 5 LBS BACK, and I stopped taking it 3 weeks ago. So, I would recommend starting with 1 a day and not taking it for more than a month at a time. This is not a magic pill for people who need to to lose more than 7-10 lbs, for those people - eat better and exercise at least 20 mins a day - get healthy."
3493,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,2/2,5.0,My cat could no longer jump up on our bed and was unhappy about it. These steps were an easy solution and she's happily sleeping with us again.Assembly
3494,Step2 Real Projects Workshop,0/0,4.0,"My toddler boy is always fascinated with the workshop, so we decided to get him a tool bench of his own. This set is great. He loves making stuff out of it, drilling in screws, etc. We have gotten lots of use out of this and he's still not tired of it..."
3495,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,0/3,5.0,i dont think women should have all the fun so i got this for both purposes as a sex toy and a massager i climaxed the most intense climax ever in my life with this wand now i know why you women like it so much and why its so intense to you in your vaginal region because this thing is intense
3496,"Now Foods, Psyllium Husks Whole Vegetarian",1/1,2.0,"I purchased the 1 lb bag, as it was slightly better priced than the 12oz cannister I had previously purchased, but this just wasn't the product for me.On the other hand, I got the 12 oz cannister and had much different results. It worked as it should have, and I was able to leave the house and go venture out in public, without fear of small crowded spaces..I drink plenty of water when I use this product, so not sure what the difference is, but I would say allergic reaction to the product in the 1 lb bag. Tossed it. Just my experience."
3497,"Health Asure - Mint Assure, 160 capsules",0/0,5.0,This product actually works! Sometimes you can just taste the garlic in your mouth when getting home from going out to dinner. Take two with a glass of water.
3498,Contradiction for Men by Calvin Klein,0/0,5.0,Very good in every aspect.Price is cheaper than store price. Also not many store carries it.Buy it. it is worth the price.
3499,Goldwell Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,3.0,"First of all, I love to use Goldwell Ultra Rich Conditioner to treat my hair. This product restores vibrant health to even the most deeply damaged hair and sets the hair back to its original stage. It dramatically helps increas strength against breakage. Normally, after 2-3 treatment, my hair has a shiny healthy look. My hair was never soft but this product give my hair a sleek look that I don't have to spend time to straight or style except comb my hair in the morning after shower.Second, a small bottle goes a long way. My previous 1 liter bottle last a very very long time. I don't know if they have expiration date but after a year, the quality of the product still very good.I was disappointed for my recent purchase from ASAP Beauty. The conditioner came out very watery and it doesn't have the magic effect on my hair any more. My hair went puffy and curly at the second day after the treatment.I am not sure if the company changed its formula or just something wrong with this bottle but I will give the product another try from a different seller."
3500,KidCo Safeway Safety Gate,0/0,5.0,"We bought this as a top of the stairs mounted gate. Installation was ok, make sure you read the directions and follow the template. Once it is installed it is VERY secure. It can be opened and closed with one hand without a problem. The little guy can bang away all day and it's not going anywhere. Worth the price."
3501,Sombra Pain-Relieving Gel,0/0,5.0,I bought this sombra cream for my Mom as she has arthritis in her knees and this is the only thing that helps.Great product and I recommend it. It is also the price from Amazon.com. Other companies are much higher priced.
3502,36 Stink Bombs/ Stink Bomb- w/ Itching Powder,0/0,5.0,This item served the exact purpose why I ordered it. Price was perfect and smell was spectacular. Would recommend to a friend.
3503,Petmate Indigo Dog House,0/0,3.0,"It was easy to put together even for someone with arthritic hands and 0 mechanical intelligence, so that's a big plus. There must be a better product.This may not hold up as advertised as it already (after 2 months or so) has scratches on the side, but perhaps raccoons got it?My feral cats won't go in it despite horrific storms and a nice cushion they like as a perch on lawn chairs (covered in a cat pad that is irresistable to the tamed feral cat) placed inside it. The reviews all said the feral cats loved it. I thought this would be irresistable, sturdier and warmer than it appears to be."
3504,Jarrow Formulas L-Glutamine Powder,8/8,5.0,"We have been using glutamine powder for several years for several reasons. Glutamine helps rebuild the lining of the gastrointestinal system; spending tons on probiotics without taking this is literally wasted money. It also is good for building muscle. It also is necessary in the production of glutathione which protects the liver and helps with detoxification. So everyone really should take Glutamine (or really expensive glutathione!). After discovering two members of my family have celiac, this became even more important to take to rebuild the intestinal lining that the gluten compromised and help restore health so that the intestine can absorb the nutrients it should--my husband gained 20 lbs in six months (believe me, he needed to!) and he needed to get his cholesterol back up to a healthy level. Glutamine does not cause weight gain--it just repaired his intestinal tract to be able to absorb nutrients. And doctors have always congratulated him on his low cholesterol! Don't allopathic doctors know cholesterol is necessary for many functions? (sorry for the rant!) It's really necessary for us to do our own research and take control of our health decisions.Always take on an empty stomach--I take mine with my probiotic first thing in the morning.Other brands we have used have been slightly gritty, chalky and with a slightly bitter unpleasant aftertaste--we just presumed all glutamine was like that and quickly washed it down with more water. The price is spectacular. Our doctor has met the owner of Jarrow and says he is extremely fastidious (well, he said ""anal,"" lol) about the quality of his products, so when I am deciding between nutritional products now, the Jarrow brand factors heavily. Also, the amount recommended on the container is less, so we are presuming it is because the quality is higher."
3505,"X-Mat Original Pet Training Mat, Firm, 18-Inch",0/0,5.0,"It works perfectly, is mobile and easy to put away when guests come. I'm ordering more as a fact to protect my Christmas Tree."

However one of the bees broke after 2 hours and the hive broke after the first day. Its a cool idea but its just cheapy material, but for $10 I was expecting a it to last a little longer."
3512,Tadpoles Basics Gingham Rod Pocket Window Valance,0/0,5.0,"We use them for our son's farm themed nursery and they are great. Good price, good product that tie together the theme well."
3513,Natrol Tonalin CLA 1200mg,0/0,5.0,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value, especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However, if foul smells bother you, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar, that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great, it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"

3517,iCell Tech Size 10 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,5.0,"Bought these for my mother's hearing aid. Wasn't expecting much's considering the price but after reading a few reviews decided what the heck - worse case they won't work and I'll have blown $11 - 12. Batteries purchased from the store were lasting maybe 5 days before she had to change them out. These batteries are lasting 11 - 12 days! Last longer for less money - who could ask for more from tiny little hearing aid batteries??? Very, very pleased with this purchase."
3518,"Uplift Technologies DL930 Day-Light 10,000 Lux SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) Lamp",6/6,5.0,"I've had this light for a few years now, and I like it. I live in NYC and I tend to use it from late October to early March, sometimes as long as the spring equinox.Product Quality:It generates a lot of light for its size. I have not ever experienced the burning smell that others have reported, even when I have it on for an hour at a time (which I sometimes do when I am working, as my desk doesn't allow me to sit at the recommended distance comfortably.) It's solidly built, easy to put together and take apart, and not as precarious as the picture makes it look.It is on the large side, and it won't blend in with your decor unless you live in Ikea, a hospital, or perhaps an early-2000s dot-com cubicle. But if you're buying it, you're probably buying it as a therapeutic device, so the aesthetics should be secondary to its effects.Therapeutic Effect:This is a ""white light"" box, which is the only kind that has been evaluated in peer-reviewed trials according to the nonprofit Center for Environmental Therapeutics. Blue lights haven't been studied very much and full-spectrum lights just include the harmful UVA/UVB rays that we normally wear sunscreen to avoid! Your mileage may vary, but I'd definitely recommend reading up thoroughly before buying any kind of light therapy product. It's like an herbal supplement - no official agency is evaluating the manufacturer's claims, so it's on you to do your research.It's true that the light from this lamp has a bit of a yellow cast, but this doesn't bother me aesthetically and doesn't seem to interfere with its effectiveness -- I haven't tried a higher-power light so I couldn't say for sure, but this one has the desired effects for me. I feel better able to concentrate and remember things, I sleep a little better, and my mood is better on days that I use the lamp. For me it doesn't totally remove the winter blues, but it provides a very noticeable boost."

3522,Gardus R4203613 LintEater LintCatcher,0/1,1.0,"It was totally a waste of money. What I received was either incomplete, or it just didn't work. My son came and took the dryer apart and cleaned all of the venting. Now the dryer works like new."

3527,ThinkFun Izzi,0/0,5.0,I have used this puzsle for years. Had to get a new one!!! It is nice because in the beginning there are over 8 possibilities instead of just one in a regular jigsaw puzzle. It really seems to stimulate my patient's hand/eye coordination and makes them think.

3530,"Medline Aluminum Frame Transfer Bench, Composite",0/0,5.0,"This bath bench is fantastic. The suction cups make it extremely stable, and the fact that it stretches beyond the edge of the tub eliminates the danger of transfers. Construction is solid without making it heavy, and my son put it together in about two minutes. It cost less than any if the others, and arrived almost a week earlier than the original estimate.It was such a relief finally being able to shower!!!!"

3536,Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs,0/0,5.0,"This is a very VERY useful product. It's necessary to block all power outlets that aren't in use. Babies and kids are generally inquisitive, always poking things into outlets. One pack of these is more than enough to plug all those vacant sockets in the typical home.It fits tight enough to stop my boy from removing it while allowing me or my wife to easily get it out when we need to use the outlet."

3539,Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,0/0,4.0,"I love my lashes curled but I never found a mechanical curler that didn't pinch or pull lashes or create fake looking curls. Once you get the hang of this heated curler you will use it every day. The natural looking curl lasts very well if you are using mascara - apply mascara first then curl! one star off because this thing uses up batteries like crazy, and there is no auto magic shut off so if you forget to turn it off that's a battery down the tubes. I am going to invest in rechargeable though, that's how much I love this thing!"
3540,Transformers Card Game,0/0,2.0,"I purchased this card game about 2 years ago for my 6 year old grandson.... In fairness, I never got around to contacting the seller, so problem may have been resolved if I had. However...cards were durable, pretty, and nice as a collectible, but instructions didn't make sense to me. We tried and tried but couldn't figure out how to play the card games. Maybe it was just me."

3542,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"We had been using an air cleaner for years and I wondered how many dollars was spend on electricity. I had bought an electronic machine and didn't like the fact that it only worked on a timer mode, plus it didn't drown out the noise very well. This unit works like a champ. I highly recommend it."

3544,Dutch Blitz,0/0,5.0,"This is a great family game, it's easy to learn and fun for many ages...the only con I can think of is that you can only have four people play at once. If they added a few more colors, it could be a good group game as well."

Thee ..... aroma filled my apartment for a couple of days, mind you I threw out the can the same day I opened. There was a strong bite, bitterness to these.... from the smoking process maybe? Whatever it was it made these unedible for me. Now if you like seriously strong flavored smoked fish then this is for you."
3547,Guillotine,0/0,5.0,"I first played Guillotine at my neighbors house and had a blast playing it. The gameplay is fairly quick, so you can play an entire game (3 rounds) is as little as a half hour. Even more fun if you play with bad french accents."

3555,Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"Unlike the Buster Cube and other hard plastic treat dispensing toys, this toy is soft, so when your dog rolls it around the floor to get the treats, you won't want to pull your hair out and your floors and furniture will not be damaged. Another key benefit is that you can adjust the size of the opening by unscrewing the two parts a little more, making it easy to use a range of food or treat sizes. This gets regular use at my house."
3556,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"This is one of my cat's favorite toys. They both play with it, and they both use the scratching pad, too. The rolling noise can be annoying if you're trying to sleep, so put it somewhere that it won't bother you."

3558,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,5.0,"My daughter runs cake business. She needed a navy blue, but there was none to be had near us. After much searching and a little trepidation, she had me order this for her. This is EXACTLY the color it says it is. It's a beautiful navy blue that turns out nicely EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. We've also found that, like the reds, you can sometimes get a bit of taste when trying to blend colors to make a good navy which may have something to do with the brand. At any rate, there is no taste at all with this. She is very satisfied and will use this again."
3559,Cosmic Slide,0/0,2.0,"This slide lasted approx 1 month, My kids are rougher than most the bottom landing area ripped, and the entire slide was then useless. If your kids are on the smaller size, I could see it lasting a season."

3568,Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox,2/2,2.0,"We've always been a multiple-cat household, except for brief In Between Cats periods. As such we've always had multiple litterboxes.We had four litterboxes when we got the two new additions. They were standard litterboxes and the new kittens, well, I don't know how something so adorable made something that smelled THAT bad, but they just were not cutting it. So I figured I'd try these Clever Cat ones since everyone raves about them.I got four. I replaced two of our standard boxes with Clever Cats. At first the covers were off.Problems became apparent almost instantly. All my cats are about 10lbs, so they're not huge, and the kittens were even smaller a few months ago. And they barely fit in these things. I mean, they're cats, of course they ""fit"", but it did not look comfortable. And that's with the tops off.Another problem is cleaning. Because the walls of these boxes are so high, you can only get your scoop in lengthwise. And frankly while it might save on the cats tossing litter all over the place, I was MORE than making up for it when I was cleaning the boxes. Made a HUGE mess since it's impossible to get the scoop in at a comfortable angle without moving the boxes all over the place.Eventually I replaced all four litterboxes, and had to permanently keep the tops off since the cats refused to use the things otherwise... and even then one of the cats still refuses to use them, so we have an Out Of Litterbox Experience for the first time.I've replaced them with standard litterboxes. For me this was a waste of ~$140 since you can't really return or resell used litterboxes. Oh well."
3569,Discrete Adjustable Support Compression Hernia Relief Belt,1/1,5.0,I didn't know such a thing exsisted until a friend with the same problem told me how much they relieved the discomfort of a hernia. I ordered this from Amazon and it was promptly shipped by the seller. The design is comfortable with no buckles and adjusts to fit easily. Recommed this one if you have a need for such a thing.
3570,Butterscotch 12 Oz. Ground Coffee,0/0,1.0,"If you order this on a regular basis, They will send you something called ""Butterscotch Toffee"" half the time instead of the butterscotch you ordered which is very bitter. If you complain to the only person that works there, she will INSIST it is the same thing. It is not. Even when you point out the fact that BOTH varieties are on their website with different descriptions and very different prices. Also, your order will be fresh coffee once in a while. When it is fresh, it is wonderfully fragrant. When it is not fresh, well, there is no nice smell lingering anywhere. If they make a mistake on your order, they will do everything possible not to permit an exchange. Take it from somebody that has 18 years ordering experience from this company...."
3571,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"That's right it's not the color pictured and it still got 4 stars because I like the color anyways! I really did want that minty green, it's so pretty, the color I got is more of a blue color. But it's a great spring color and if course it'll still get used :)"

3574,Adventure Medical Kits UltraLight and Watertight,0/0,5.0,"Very nice kit, just as described. All of the medications are current, and good for at least 18 months, some more. Room to add your own meds, bandages, ect. Two watertight press seal bags, within the yellow and blue bag shown, keep things safe and organized."
3575,Grannicks Bitter Apple 8oz w/Sprayer,0/0,2.0,"This product didn't seem to work for me. I have two 1 year old Siamese Cats, sprayed my rugs completely, and they still continue to chew, tear, and lift my rugs just as they did before I sprayed them. Possibly there is a better product that is specific for cats out there, haven't found it yet."
3576,"Promax 12 per pack, 2.64 oz. each",0/0,5.0,This product has exactly the right nutritional makeup and tastes great! Many bars are chocolate flavored and I prefer these. The flavor is just like a cookie.
3577,TURBO POWER Twinturbo 2800 Coldmatic Hair Dryer 314,0/0,5.0,"I'm so glad I got this dryer. My hair was starting to look fried and lifeless, I think it was due to the other ion dryers I was using. Someone recommended that I look into the TwinTurbo and I'm so glad I invested the money."
3578,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,4.0,"I only chose the 4 star rating because it was a little smaller than I expected. The product is great! It is simply the size that I was slightly disappointed with. Soft material and the edges give a cushion to the dog and a little snuggle area, if the dog fits in the bed. My dog just lays on top of it but she likes it."
3579,Jarrow Formulas Inositol Powder,4/4,5.0,"I am so glad I found this Inositol! I have been taking it for a month and a half and will now never live without it. And Jarrow products are of high quality.As a former java junkie I have likely depleted stores of it in my liver; I probably was deficient in it to begin with. While I thought I ate healthfully I didn't get enough fiber and Inositol is found there.I researched it and found it is supposed to help with Type 2 Diabetes, ADD, ADHD, OCD and SAD. It is important in helping your liver burn fat and blood sugar and remove it from the blood stream. If your liver can't burn fat or handle sugar effectively, then cholesterol starts to accumulate in your body. I have problems with most all these issues. A doc told me I was PCOS ""light"".The biggest boon was to my mood. After a few days of starting it (slowly @ 1/4t increased to ~ 2t a day). I used to be moody and irritable. I noticed at about day 4 my husband and I got into a fight about an oft fought 'bout topic. Normally it would escalate with me being the hotter of the two. This time I was totally cool. I was rational! And the hubby later had to say sorry. That was nice for a change.I think the powder is a nicer form to take it. It mixes easily in water and anything that helps me drink more water the better. Tastes lightly sweet too.I give this to my husband who still likes to drink too much coffee.I hope this helps."
3580,Premium Madagascar Vanilla beans 1/4 lb by JR Mushrooms,0/0,4.0,"The beans I received were a little harder than I hoped for. They were small and there were several more than 27 included, so I knew they were on the petite side. I bought them to make vanilla extract and so far they seem to be working just fine. I'll definitely buy again. I received them two days after ordering. I had an email with tracking number 2 HOURS after I ordered so their service is fast. Overall great transaction."
3581,Take-A-Part Vehicle Building Toy Set,2/2,5.0,My son got this for his 6th Birthday and he loves it my two year old daughter plays with it too. They love taking it apart and putting it back together again. It is very durable and also teaches them hand coordination. I am definitely going to have to get more of this companies products
3582,Tempa-Dot Disposable Thermometer Sterile (Box of 100),0/0,5.0,"My doctor asked me to monitor my temperature every day and specifically told me not to use digital(inaccurate reading). Every morning, I just pop this one for 60 seconds and I've been getting pretty steady reading."

3586,Playtex Spill-Proof Cup Replacement Valves,0/0,5.0,"Buying these lets me extend the life of all my son's sippys. These valves make or break the sippy, so glad they were a resonable price."
3587,Ticket To Ride - Europe,0/0,5.0,We have owned the US version for some time and love it! Since we lived in Europe for 3 years we decided we must have the European version as well.

3589,Digestive Advantage IBS for the Dietary Management of Intensive Bowel Support - 32 Ea,0/0,4.0,I have been using it over the past three weeks while weaning myself off imodium. This product seems to be relieving the same symptoms of diarrhea and gas at a much cheaper price than imodium.

3595,Depend Refastenable Protective Pant,0/0,5.0,"The nurses at Qunicy Village, Qunicy, PA like them for the personal care patients and my mother-in-law seems to like them,she been wearing them for a few mounths now. And that I can send to directly to her is wonderful for has the POA for her."
3596,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,5.0,"There are little rounds of rubbery plastic on the straight bars in the 4 corners so it rolls nicely when you try to move it and they act as a buffer between the kennel and the floor. They are less wheels and more rollers so it isn't like you have to lock the wheels so your dog doesn't roll away. You wouldn't even notice them unless you pushed the kennel on hardwood.In general, these kennels are ALWAYS the BEST! Build well, easy to maintain, foldable, and safe. A must have for all pet parents."
3597,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,Both my little dachshunds love them and haven&#8217;t had any problems chewing or digesting them. Will be ordering another container since they are almost out.
3598,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,I bought this sound machine years ago and it is still working great. While living in close military housing we needed something to drown out neighborhood noise. I love this machine.
3599,"Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"A good, solid product. I will probably order again, but would like to experiment with other flavors.Being prepackaged there is an added reliability, predictability to the result. Pay much attention to the water quantity. I substituted butter for olive oil with success. However this is not the best bread I had and has a cake-like quality that may please others, but not me."
3600,"Jelly Belly Mini Bean Machine, with Assorted Flavor Jelly Beans",0/0,5.0,Used at work and the children love it. Avoids everyones hands getting direclty on candy. I just re-use the pennys!
3601,"Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier, Large, Black",0/0,5.0,I was so worried that this carrier would be too small for my 20lb beagle/pug mix but it was PERFECT! I saw a lot of bags at Pet Smart that said they would only hold up to 18lb and looked a little small but this worked out great. It fit under the seat of my South West flight with a little manuvering. I have since used it thrice.
3602,Himalaya Liver Care,0/1,1.0,The real liver care has totally different ingredients. Some of the ingred in this product are toxic to your body. So def not something i will b ordering again
3603,Wahl Groomsman T Blade Shaver & Trimmer,0/0,4.0,"I struggle with a portable shaving solution when I don't have regular setup and I would honestly suggest this a great option for males seeking a solution that will not cause razor bumps and irritations. The product came in good condition and I was happy with the quality. I would on recommend this as your primary choice for shaving needs as it doesn't get very close; however, I does the job in a pinch (actually it does not pinch).I hope you find a solution that works for you!"
3604,"N Large Powder, 3.8 lb",0/0,5.0,"I had used N-Large2 and N-Large before. I was a little irritated that the Subscribe & Save program successively was suspended on each of them, requiring me to twice create a new order. The improvement with N-Large3 more than compensates though. While I saw a little difference between N-Large and N-Large2, the difference in N-Large3 is dramatic.1. The taste has noticeably improved. It was good before, but was rather too sweet.2. It is much more soluble. Despite using a shaker with a ball, I would always end up with clumps. No longer a problem.3. The texture has improved. It had before seemed just a little on the sludgy side, but no more."
3605,Perhaps By Bob Mackie For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7 Oz.,0/0,5.0,I was at my doctors office when I picked up a magazine with a simple of this parfum and it and I rubbed it on my hand 6 hours later it was still there that's when I decided to buy it. I just love what I received.
3606,"Jay Robb Enterprises - Whey Vanilla 24oz, 24 oz powder",1/1,4.0,"I have a friend who researches every detail of everything she consumes. So when she switched to this product, I had to try it. It has been great so far. Being a vegetarian, I use this to supplement my daily protein intake. I mix this with one cup of Trop50 orange juice (which is sweetened with stevia). JR VANILLA whey protein has 110 calories per serving and the juice has 50 calories, so I get 25g protein for 160 calories. Mixed with the ORANGE JUICE it is awesome! Eating my protein supplement has always been a chore because everything on the market seems to have a funky taste. But this combination tastes like those orange creamsicles I use to eat as a kid! Love it.My only complaint to Jay Robb is THE COST. Come on, JR, haven't you made enough money yet? Take it down a notch.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Ingredients"
3607,Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,0/0,5.0,My grand daughter really does not like to do tummy time. We are giving this to her in hopes that it will perk her interest and make tummy time more enjoyable for her. I think she is going to love this because of all the colors and the toys that are floating inside.
3608,Lady-Comp Fertility Monitor - Fahrenheit,1/1,5.0,"I have been using the Lady Comp for almost a year now. Before getting married, I had already decided against any kind of unnatural form of BC. So I did some research and found the Lady Comp. I bought it a few months before getting married so that it would have a few months to learn my cycle. It make natural family planning so much easier. I don't think I would last very long having to chart my own basal body temperature every morning. The Lady Comp does all the thinking for me. I would recommend the Lady Comp to anyone."
3609,Comfort Shield Incontinence Barrier Cream Cloths - 32 Pk,0/0,5.0,These cloths work very well. This is my third time purchasing from this company. I ordered two packs and would have ordered more but they were out of stock. I recommend this product and will buy more in the future.
3610,Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count,0/0,4.0,"I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well. I've been using it for about two weeks and still going strong, also I read the ORAL B mark will scratch off fakes, which it does not with these. I recommend saving some money and ordering these refill heads."
3611,"Good Earth Original Tea, 18 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",3/3,1.0,"I ordered Good Earth tea. When it arrived, I saw that the ingredients have changed and now contain artificial flavor. Yes, this info is listed online, but silly me, I've been drinking Good earth for years and didn't know they have recently changed their recipe. I have cannot simply imbibe whatever nameless artificial ingredient I want (medical issues). Currently, this product is not eligible for returns. I suggest that Amazon put a large warning message on this product to let shoppers know prior to purchase that this is not ""Original Sweet & Spicy"" Good Earth. The original tea doesn't have artificial flavors in it. Also, I looked online, and this company has very suspect practices. The 18-bag box of tea has artificial flavors in it, but the 25-bag box does not. I don't trust the tea maker, and their business practices are creepy. Now I have six boxes (108 tea bags) of tea I'm never going to drink. AWESOME."
3612,Dream Baby Swing Close Security Gate (shown with extensions included),0/0,4.0,Very easy to install and feels very sturdy. Easy to open and close with the right adjustments. We've been really happy so far.
3613,Redline Energy Drink,0/2,1.0,Maybe if you workout it's ok but be careful because it can make your heart race too much. I took.a whole bottle because im used to taking bigger energy drinks with multiple serving in the can but it was a huge mistake... my heart was beating out of my chest for over 8 hours and I was sweating for about just as long. I'm a big guy and not overweight 6' 3 and weigh 190... DO NOT TAKE!!!
3614,Bragg Organic Vinegar Apple Cider (),1/1,5.0,"It is so good for SO many health ailments including acid reflux (GERD), which I know it helped cure me of. :D"
3615,Yakshi Fragrances Roll-On Fragrance,3/3,5.0,I love it! This is a cleaning smelling scent that lingers all day long. I receive many compliments when I have it on.
3616,Bach Essence Star of Bethlehem 20 Milliliters,0/0,4.0,Could not match this price anywhere else and it is the exact same product found in the stores. Good job.
3617,"HoMedics SS-2000E Sound Spa Nature Sounds Machine with 6 Nature Sounds, Silver",1/1,2.0,"The volume knob quickly broke such that you have to fiddle with it to get the sound to work. Every time you adjust it, it cuts in and out.If you only like white noise and/or the heartbeat sound, you probably will be ok with this machine. The other sounds are looped recordings that only last a couple of seconds, and click at the repeat because they are not ""tiled"". They contain unique standouts that repeat so often you can't help but tune into it. It would be great if someone made a machine like this that didn't repeat every 2 or 3 seconds! If you made it 15 minutes before repeats (and start at a random place when initializing) then nobody would notice or care. A few seconds of the rainforest for example sounds like this:-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep"
3618,Tupperware Shape O Ball Toy,0/0,5.0,"My daughter is 30 and I got the Shape O ball for her when she was small. We played with this thing endlessly. I think it contributed to her becoming an engineer. So when little granddaughter came along, I got another one. It is so cute listening to a 2 year old say pentagon or trapezoid. This is great for recognizing and sorting shapes-circle, oval, square, wedge, triangle, trapezoid, pentagon, hexagon, star--good for motor skills, too.I think it is a bit pricey for some plastic, but it is better than other shape toys I have seen and the BEST THING OF ALL"
3619,Dandelion Root Tea - 30 - Bag,0/0,5.0,I use this to make my own mix for disolving my kidney stones. It works great and I have had less back pain as a result. Next time I plan on getting a 1 lbs bag in the non-tea bag form.
3620,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/1,1.0,We have years of experience using hair clippers in our household. We just bought this locally to replace a lithium cordless Wahl that died in 10 months after only 10 uses.This Wahl color pro looked fine but when my wife trimmed my neck we found out the hard way that the metal blade guard was screwed on slightly crooked and one side of the blades teeth were exposed to saw into my skin. I had high hopes for this with all the positive reviews but this one is dangerous. I am going to go with a different brand after owning two defective Wahl products.
3621,Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System,0/1,3.0,"I really like this combo, but I feel like you really have to add in a toner in order to exfoliate the dead cells off; otherwise, the regimen does not work."
3622,"MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment, Psoriasis Treatment, Intensive Strength, 3.8 oz.",0/1,2.0,i am using this shampoo almost 3 weeks it stopped itching but does not help my seborrheic dermatitis. therefore coal tar causes can cause cancer so i am going to throw away these shampoo. just waste of money
3623,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,I LOVE IT AND SO DO MY DOG YOKI EVERYTIME I GRAB HE'S KNOWS HE GOING OUTSIDE. REALLI LOVE IT
3624,NOZTONOZ Sof-Krate Indoor/Outdoor Pet Home,1/1,5.0,This soft crate had the quality I had hoped for when I ordered it.It is easy to set up and sturdy enough for my Rottweilers to be in for temporary crating when I am traveling.My dogs are already crate trained and do not try to escape confinement as no tent crate in made to hold an untrained dog.I really like them for the use that they are intended for.
3625,Dermalogica Clearing Skin Wash,0/0,5.0,"Hi, I tried a sample of Anti Bac and loved it! The replacement product is the Medibac line which is based on Salylic acid, which SUX! Anyone that reads this review should complain to Dermalogica.com, like I have, and request that they bring the product back or create a comparable solution, BESIDES lame Salylic acid, which does not work for most people. Even Benziol Peroxzide is much better if going the chemical route, while I preferred the natural Anti Bac wash and it is the ONLY product they have that works for acne in a more natural way. Please help me complain to Dermalogica.com. Thank you!"
3626,Now Foods Apple Cider Vinegar,2/2,5.0,"I am using this product as I try to lose weight. I am losing slowly, not sure if product is helping, but I recommend."
3627,"Arrowhead Mills Organic Puffed Wheat Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/1,5.0,"it taste good, and I like it. I dont like that # of words are requuired here though. that is dumb."
3628,Oxy Life Stabilized Oxygen - w/ Colloidal Silver and Aloe vera - 16oz,0/0,3.0,"I have had some issues with candidiasis as well as my adopted child. My ND was talking about various products - I know Kevin Trudeau is a big proponent of food grade H2O2 so instead of trying that (the drops in the distilled water protocol as described in books like The One Minute Cure seemed really hard to do when you are dealing with a special needs child and other issues every day) I thought I would let myself give this product a try. I have been doing coconut oil and taking a very good probiotic - Biokult - which is recommended by Dr. Campbell McBride who is behind the specific carb GAPS diet so my personal problems with all of these things have been better - however I did experience some cramping and what I think was a 'die off' herxheimer reaction to some degree the first two days I took this - then I began to feel far better and more energized. I do, however, work with someone who does allergy corrections with the energy vials - like NAET but beyond that - and she said after I'd used this product about two weeks or so that there was some issue that I had to 'treat' for and I had to do that while holding this bottle and doing the acupressure tapping. However the issue seemed to be resolved and I did take my first dose again after being off it some weeks and I do think it has helped my energy.One other benefit - I have fought constant cystic acne on my back since puberty - it's been better since I've been working on food allergies and the candida issues and taking some hormonal stuff to help with an imbalance but this was the only product that really made a difference on my skin. And it has helped my energy. I can't speak for anyone else.My friend who does that energy work says 'everyone is a snowflake' meaning everyone is such an individual you really do not know if you will handle this product that one person got great benefit from but another person may not tolerate well, so I just think bear that in mind. On the flip side, it's not much money to give a shot - I have blown far far more on vitamins and drugs et al which I promptly had to chuck out from having a bad side effect reaction. One dose of the cipro family antibiotic avelox nearly sent me to the hospital once - after having to shell out nearly $130 for a ten day supply. I have had chronic sinusitis which is why I was always taking antibiotics and why I think my gut is messed up now, amongst other reasons including food allergies, etc. The coconut oil, oil pulling with it, taking it orally, cooking with it and adding this to the mix has helped a lot. I have not had to take an antibiotic for a sinus infection in over 2 years and this was after taking them for 30 years sometimes multiple times during the year for recurring infections. So that is another plus."
3629,Sunbeam 731-500 Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,0/0,4.0,Worth your money especially if you are looking for easy to use and simple to work with! Great quality for your money!
3630,"Simple Solution Puppy Aid Training Spray, 8 Ounces",0/0,2.0,used to help pottie train my puppies on the pee pads but they didn't seem like the spray did any good I would not buy again
3631,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/1,1.0,Fenugreek Seed tea smells and tastes awful. I don't like the taste or smell of curry and this reminded me of it very much. I could not drink even one cup and I have several candles burning trying to get the smell out of my apartment!
3632,Nature's Plus Spiru-Tein High Protein Energy Meal,0/0,4.0,I'm really happy with Spiru-tein. I have only tried vanilla so far. It mixes really well and tastes really good. It is sweet on its own. When I mixed two scoops and a pint of unsweetened almond milk it tasted like cake batter! I personally have a very large sweet tooth so this is ok for me in small amounts. You can add water to cut the sweetness. It is also very filling so it can satisfy as a meal or snack.
3633,Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"This booster seat works great for our 24-mo-old who moved from her high chair last month. The finish on this is nice and it cleans up easily with soap and water. Seems like it will be able to work for the next year (our girl is small, 20 lbs, but 32 inches tall so she sits up there)."
3634,Button Cell Type 394 Battery,1/1,4.0,I placed the battery inside the watch and within a nanosecond it powered up! It was very emotional and very uplifting.
3635,BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original,0/1,2.0,"I wore this contraption for my newborn. Not a good idea. The baby fell out once this AM while I was leaning forward. Baby hit the ground sleeping and thank God nothing happened to the baby (she remained asleep). This is NOT for newborns who are still tiny (mine is 7lbs 3 oz at discharge from the hospital). I strongly suggest you don't use this product while running around the house even for a sec. Good for sitting in a sofa doing computer work, as I have done so. But the moment you start walking, a tiny baby will fall through the cracks and hit the floor. It happened almost the second time again today. Thank God I was able to catch her with my left elbow.I also have to complain that this is not for anyone weighing 200 lbs to strap this on. It is very tight and no room to adjust, were you to try to use this on a young infant with a size 44 chest adult male physique. Not going to work well. Better find another product safer and more comfortable for you and the baby. It is best for a woman and bigger baby.And yes, i know, this is for 8lbs+ baby per instruction. But it is almost close enough for people to get fooled like me. Better put it away for small babies. Must read the instructions!!"
3636,Elasto Gel Hot / Cold Sinus Mask,0/0,5.0,This has been a great purchase. The material is not uncomfortable and the velcro band seems to stay put. I would recommend this product.
3637,Melissa & Doug Children of the World Floor 48-Piece Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,We are proud that our 5 year old daughter put it together all by herself. She is learning about other countries. The puzzle itself forms a mat-like circle more than a foot across.
3638,TRESOR by Lancome for WOMEN,0/0,5.0,"I received my first order of Tresor body lotion yesterday. I just ordered two more. This is such a lovely scent. Everytime I wear it I get compliments. It is not heavy, just wonderful. I like it better than the perfume and the body creme.This seller delivers just like they say they will. Right on the date.Thank you so much. Love it."
3639,Heine Otoscope Tips 4.0 Mm - 50 Per Bag,0/0,5.0,"Excelent for professional pediatric use. No matter how much your patient dislikes routine check up, they will leave with a smile"
3640,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head,0/0,5.0,My 6 mo. dental cleanings have become faster and easier because the Sonicare brushes really work! I love the compact heads which fit into a small mouth and reach all areas. I recommend this product to everyone!
3641,3M STERI-STRIP Skin Closure - 1/2 x 4 - Envelope,0/0,5.0,"I fell into the corner of a wall while sleepwalking (I know, I know, how ridiculous) and managed to split open my chin. I had to get 8 stitches, and I had a huge gross stitched line on my chin, which is hardly the new accessory I wanted for my work look. I tried bandaids, but the face is an oily place, and they would just peel off all the time, especially with the location on my chin moving the bandage so much when I talked. Also, regular bandaids just look gross right on your face like that. Ugh. But then, I went to the doctor to get the stitches removed, and she used these steri-strips to hold the wound shut (they take out face stitches way earlier than full healing, because you don't want to heal around the stitches and end up with a huge and raised scar).Anyway, these steri-strips were BEYOND FANTASTIC for covering the wound/scar as it was healing; I kept it covered at all times because of hygienic reasons since the cut was so close to my mouth, and at night as well because it itched and the steri-strip protected it from me unconsciously scratching it.I love these so much.Then a coworker was getting moles removed, so I gave her the extra package of these I had bought, and she loved them too. If the wound is still open or sore, these will stick a bit, so just use a little neosporin so it won't stick. Otherwise though, these STAY PUT, which is really helpful.Oh, in my experience, be sure to change these every day. They'll feel like they could stick forever, and once the wound had healed into a scar, I was tempted to leave these for longer than a day, and they'll easily last for that, but when left on longer than about a day, the adhesive gets kind of gummy sticky, which isn't pleasant.Overall, I love these...but I'm thrilled I don't have to wear them anymore!"
3642,Eternity Eau de Parfum for Women by Calvin Klein,1/1,5.0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS GREAT PRICE. LOVE THE SMELLITS A GREAT PRODUCT . I LOVE CALVIN KLEINS PRODUCTS
3643,Sanyo Eneloop AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries with Charger - 4 Pack,0/0,5.0,I bought these to power some communications equipment. They fit the need perfectly. These mate with the built in charger and appear to have the rated capacity.

3645,Permectrin II - 32 oz,0/0,4.0,We had a bad year for flys and I was trying some new sprays to see if any would work better for my horse. My farrier recamened this product and so far it seems to work pretty good. I purshaed it late in the year so the flys were winding down.This summer will be the real test.
3646,Mendota Products Small Slip Lead,2/2,4.0,"I had to return this and exchange for the 6 ft, as i had forgotten how short 4 ft can be. Stylish too. I was able to return and exchange with NO hassles."
3647,"Walk Over Wooden Gate (30-44"" W, 18"" H)",0/0,2.0,"I got this for my mini dachshund puppy and for my very narrow doorway. It looked awesome and worked good at first but I had to keep tightening the bolts and now it's been tightened so much it won't stay up. The doorway is awesome and closes good but it didn't always close tight because its only a handle with a spring that you pull. Sometimes the hole didnt line up exactly and I'd think it was closed but it wasn't. The height was perfect until she learned to climb over it! But when I got it, it was already broken and didnt feel like spending money to return it so I just used gorilla glue which worked but I had to keep re applying every week...Overall I'd say I liked the gate but wish it was better quality!"

3649,Nylabone Durable Dental Dinosaur Chew Toy (Dinosaur Varies),0/0,5.0,"We were pulling our hair out because our boxer mix is about 10 months old and it seems she has jaws of steel. She is a powerful chewer, and chews a LOT. I got her this dinosaur and she loves it. It is the only toy that holds up to her chewing. Most toys she destroys in minutes; this one it took two weeks to get the face off and a month for her to chew off the head. She loves her dinosaur and I plan on getting her more. She will chew this for hours at a time and if anything can hold up to her powerful jaws I'm all for it. EXCELLENT for powerful chewers!!"
3650,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"We use this as a night light in my son's room, he loves the colors and stars on the ceiling."
3651,Haute Diggity Dog Jimmy Chew Shoe Chew Toy,0/1,1.0,"This thing cost a max of 50 cents to make, and that is the most anyone should pay for it. It is three inches big - that's not good for anyone."

3653,"Steamed Brown Rice Bowl, Organic, Microwaveable, 7.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,"I have always been a brown rice fan. I figured that precooked would disappoint. But I tried these and am very pleased. The rice is great right out of the microwave and they are so handy. I went through the first box, and ordered another."
3654,Kidkusion Hearth Kushion,0/0,5.0,Our fireplace hearthis pretty largeThis is life saver.Easy to install. U get more there is enough to go around. Just watch out for lil hands that want to yank it off.
3655,"Florida Orthopedics Prolite 8"" Wrist Splint, Black",0/0,5.0,"I bought both this right wrist brace/splint as well as the left one. They are both sturdy, high quality braces that are noticeably better than previous braces I've used [e.g. Sammons Preston and a Bird & ?... (Cut the label off early on so that's all I have)]. These earlier braces were more costly and of lower quality than these FLAs, at least these Pro Lite 8&#34; wrist splint deluxe models 450 & 451 for the R & L wrist. I like them enough so that I've put them on my wish list so that when they wear out eventually as they will with heavy use I can easily reorder."
3656,Petmate Le Bistro Waterer with Microban,0/0,5.0,"FINALLY! I don't have to constantly fill the water dishes! Yay! Now it's once a week... maybe a little longer. I have 1 extra large dog and 1 large dog. They drink a lot of water! This item is awesome, no regrets. REALLY EASY to clean. Even my cats use it. Great buy all three way around. I'm thinking about getting a second for outside in the backyard for when I'm gone for awhile (they always knock over the current out door one)"
3657,Orb Factory Magnetic Mosaics Jr.,0/0,2.0,"It just wasn't what I expected, the pieces are too tiny to work with. Also, the templates are incomplete, not all of them are included."
3658,Manic Panic Amplified Cream Formula,0/1,1.0,i've been using Manic Panic for 5+years.i loved the original version of vampire red very much it faded to a beautiful orange then to ginger and back to blonde.well when i bought this hoping for a longer lasting color.i left the color in for about 3 hours.i would've left it in longer but i did not have the time.the color was beautiful at first.exactly what i wanted but after a few washes i realized instead of the orange to ginger shade the original formula gave me it was leaving me with a rose color that is now fading to a pastel pink.although the color is vibrant and pretty even with it fading to pink i'm very disappointed that i'm now going to stuck with pink ends for the remainder of my pregnancy since i can not bleach out the pink.THIS DYE IS PINK BASED! IT WILL WASH OUT PINK! UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED FOR THE WORK AND MONEY IT WILL COST TO REMOVE THE PINK DON'T BUY! GO FOR THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.IT'S CHEAPER AND IT'S A BETTER COLOR
3659,Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash -- 6 fl oz,0/0,4.0,I've been using this for years and have moved to a remote area where there are no retailers who carry it.
3660,PB 8,2/2,4.0,"I have been taking pb8 since this past summer and it seems to help a great deal with my IBS which is brought on by stress. However, towards the bottom of this latest bottle I found 16 small white oval pills. I called Nutrition Now and they are now harassing me saying that they don't manufacture anything like this at their plant insinuating that this is my fault. Their customer service is extremely poor."
3661,Jerdon First Class 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer,1/1,3.0,"Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer."
3662,"Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream, Fragrance-Free, 2 Ounce",1/1,5.0,"I have spent so much money over the years on skincare ! Bought all the expensive brands ( Estee Lauder, Lancome etc ) My skin is sensitive and on the drier side and almost everything I used did not work . I use this for my face ! I am 53 and this stuff is incredible ! It makes your skin very soft and not greasy at all ! I Great under your make up too . The glycerine is the ingredient that will do the trick ! I have used it now for years and I will not buy anything else . You need so little that it lasts a long time too ."
3663,Deborah Lippmann Nail Lacquer,0/0,4.0,"The only reason it did not get five stars is that it is very translucent. It took about 5 layers for each nail to match the color of the bottle, nonetheless it is GORGEOUS! It really looks like a fish on my nails, there's large green/light blue sparkles surrounded by tiny dark blue pigment and tiny blue sparkles. I got so many compliments wearing it! It also have the colors of an abalone shell, the purples and greens and blues are to die for! It is very dimensional and once i run out i will have to buy more."
3664,Beyond Paradise Eau de Parfum for Women by Este Lauder,0/0,5.0,"I love this perfume, soft, but sofisticated, the aparience its fancy so its perfect for me, I recomend to wearing it any time!!!"
3665,Bio Ionic iDry Nano-i5X Nano-ionic Conditioning Pro-Dryer,0/0,5.0,"My husband bought this for me as a gift after another brand (also very expensive) kept breaking on me. I've always used high end hair dryers so the price didn't deter my husband. I've had this one for over a year and haven't had any issues with it. I blow dry my hair everyday and still have healthy hair. It dries quickly. I wouldn't say that it conditions my hair or that it's a miracle blow dryer, but it is better than other high end dryers. I still use conditioner daily. I would recommend this dryer over others for sure."
3666,Prestige Sphygmomanometer and Stethoscope Kit with matching Carrying Case,0/0,4.0,"Got this for the hubby who is a phelbotimist for American red cross.

3668,"LATHER Bamboo Lemongrass Foaming Body Scrub, 8-Ounce Jar",0/0,5.0,"I LOVE this stuff. It leaves your skin feeling like silk, and the scent is earthy and feminine without being too sweet or hippie-ish. I also use it on my face, just a small bit mixed with a non-exfoliating cleanser and massage gently. It is very gritty and abrasive - which I love - but this is not for thin, delicate skin."
3669,Macadamia Deep Repair Masque,2/2,5.0,it makes your hair really smooth after the shower and it does help your hair grow faster i ve noticed my hair growing longer.
3670,"Denman 7 Row Styling Brush, Black, 2 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I own 2 other denman brushes and wanted to replace them. None of the beauty supply stores here in Massachusetts and in New York (where I frequently travel) carry them, so I went to Amazon. The brush is great! The bristles are stiff rubber which works well on my hair when it is worn natural as well as when I press it for a straight look. It is especially good for wrapping at night.Only thing, I prefer the fuller sized brush but the 7-row is especially light-weight and works great when wrapping."
3671,KidKraft Waterfall Mountain Train Set and Table,0/0,5.0,"We placed it in the nursery on his birthday and he has played on that thing daily since he'd seen it. He even ran back to the room after getting his licks on the pinata (I say that to point out he wasn't very concerned with the candy). Great train set. Thomas & Friends items &#34;mostly&#34; fit (some fit perfectly, others, not so much). My suggestion, buy the wooden trains...they work the best. Otherwise, great play set if your child enjoys trains."
3672,First Responder Trauma Bag- Fully Stocked,0/0,5.0,Great! I purchased a lot of the items one of the reviewers mentioned and added it to my bag! It's large and awesome!
3673,Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver,0/0,4.0,great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.
3674,Spenco Full Length Arch Cushions,0/0,5.0,"Men's size 8-9 turned out to be a perfect match for men's size 8.5 boots. Support in the middle is slight but noticeable. Initially I wasn't sure I would like it (never had insoles like this) but now I do, even more than regular insoles. Other reviewers commented on strong smell (not sure if it was this or another model by SPENCO) but my pair doesn't have it."
3675,Tea Rose Perfume by Perfumer's Workshop for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,I GOT A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS WHEN WEARING THE PERFUME. IT'S ALITTLE STRONG INITIALLY WHEN IT'S SPRAYED ON BUT TAPERS OFF IN A FEW SECONDS.
3676,Hvy Weight Trolley Exerciser,0/0,5.0,Easy to install; all required parts were there. The only change I made was to remove the teather line hanging down (to be hooked to the dog) and replace it with a retractable leash. This prevents the dog becoming tangled in the tether line. I would suggest making this change in the item as sold.My dog can now run the length of my patio and off into the yard and yet can't get into the parking area where she could have gotten hit. Happy dog; happy owner.
3677,Four Paws Cotton Web Lead,0/0,5.0,"My husband and I need long-lines when running Nose Work with our dogs. Our 20 ft lines that we use for distance training in other sports are just a bit too hard to handle in Nose Work, so I bought the 10 footers. They're great quality, and nice colors!"
3678,"Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb.",0/0,5.0,The best Almond flour I've ever baked with. Received it just in time for all my Holiday baking! Well worth the price!
3679,"Now Foods, Relora 300 mg",2/2,4.0,"I will say that this is the only supplement that I have ordered contiually. I give it 4 stars because it makes me tired during the day. I take 2 before bed and it keeps me mellow until the next night. I like that I don't get the anxiety that I used to get, I just am not crazy about feeling so mellow all the time. It does what it says though and I keep reordering so there ya go."
3680,Andis 18065 10 Piece Clipper Kit,0/0,3.0,very good machine but should bring more parts to cut .. has no problems is very good and it was sealed and in good condition
3681,Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments,0/0,5.0,"Got it for self-buzz cuts, was not disappointed. It gets a little warm without any attachments but its bearable. Very powerful and quiet. [...] Here's a video regarding it's quick and easy maintenance."

3686,Burberry Burberry Classic,0/0,5.0,Love this scent and the order came very fast. I will be ordering it again when I run out! Thanks
3687,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/0,5.0,"This a great brand for a good price. If, like me your use headphones, have fire alarms, and so on, it's helpful to simply buy these in bulk.And, if you need another reason to buy this brand, Duracell says that their alkaline batteries can be safely disposed of with normal household waste (never dispose of batteries in fire because they could explode). Also, due to concerns about mercury in the municipal solid waste stream, Duracell has eliminated all of the added mercury from their alkaline batteries. Basically, their alkaline batteries are composed primarily of common metals--steel, zinc, and manganese. Having said that it's important not to dispose of large amounts of alkaline batteries in a group. Used batteries are often not completely ""dead."" Grouping used batteries together can bring these ""live"" batteries into contact with one another, creating safety risks."
3688,JOOP! by Joop! EDT SPRAY 2.5 OZ,0/0,5.0,"I'm buying this for my little brother and for my brother in law. I previously brought it for them before, and they loved it. It smells really good, and I recommend it."
3689,"Just for Men Shampoo-In Hair Color, Sandy Blond 10, 1 application, (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,I think gray hair looks great on other men. Just not on me. At least not yet. This product is pretty easy to use and lasts for a long time.

3692,Now Foods Shea Butter,0/0,1.0,"Well after being afraid to order the yellow Shea butter, I purchased this at a health food store. Sadly it is dry crumbly garbage. I melted it and whipped it... And it dried hard and grainy. When it melted on my skin it was greasy not smooth and silky."
3693,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Strawberries, 5-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"What can I say, it's 5lbs of greatness. If you're a candy lover of Strawberries Gummi's this is th product for you."
3694,Slicker Brush,0/0,5.0,great dog brush for my dog. She has very long long hair. I like the way it takes out all the loose undercoat. :)

3696,Jarrow Formulas Inositol Powder,4/4,5.0,"As someone who has a touch of OCD, I've been searching for long time to find an affordable and non-medicinal way to treat this condition. I tried many 'natural' cures"

3699,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"My cat Oliver loves this thing. He bats that ball around several times a day, every day. I had to get a second toy so my other cat, Christopher, could play because Oliver is always using it. Christopher plays sometimes - he is interested but not as much as Oliver. So the appeal does vary from cat to cat. They both love it when you sprinkle a little catnip on the scratching pad.The toys are durable. I have had them about three years with frequent use and they have held up well. I only thought about doing this review because I had to order more scratching pads. They last a while but do need to be replaced every 6 months to a year or so, depending on your use.This was money well spent to keep my indoor cats active."
3700,Now Foods CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) 800 mg,6/6,4.0,I have been using this product as a part of my recent weight loss regimen. It seems that my appetite has subsided slightly while on the product leading to less food cravings.My weight loss has been steady and consistent over the last two weeks. My beginning weight/body fat was 245lbs @ 23% and two weeks later I am at 240lbs @ 21.1%.Those numbers may not seem very impressive to you but you must know that I have not changed my diet or workout routine at all. Therefore I must attribute the weight/fat loss to the CLA.I would buy this product again.
3701,Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet,0/0,5.0,Melissa and Doug make the best puzzles and learning games. This is something my kids fight over so I have to get another one. Definitely recommend anything Melissa and Doug.
3702,Five Peppercorn Mix by JR Mushrooms,0/0,5.0,So much better than plain black pepper. The different pepper corns add a whole lot more flavor to your food. Love it!
3703,Invacare Reusable Bed Pads,0/0,5.0,"Very nice for potty training!! Washes well, lays flat and does not move around at night. I just lay it on top of the sheets for easy quick fix at night. I just ordered the bigger ones for long term use on all the kids queen beds. This one is just big enough for the twin bed with a 6yo."
3704,Black by Kenneth Cole New York Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"The last cologne I really liked was Polo Blue. It was really fabulous smelling, worked well for my body and I could continue to smell it faintly all day long. It was refreshing for me and complimented by others.After that I've flirted with a couple of colognes from CK and a French one, however nothing has been of the same caliber as Black. I've had this for a couple of weeks now and I think it works great for me. It is not super strong but it lasts 20+ hours and you just can't beat the price at Amazon!Cheers!"
3705,NHL Series 10,0/0,4.0,"This is a finely crafted action figure, and I only have one minor complaint about the product. There were absolutely no directions included with it. I am not a genius, and I was afraid of breaking Jarome's little hands while trying to get him to hold his stick. I finally decided to risk it and pried his plastic fingers open to allow him to grasp his stick. He is tougher than he looks, and he did not break."
3706,Original Papaya Enzyme by American Health,0/0,5.0,I'm 7 months pregnant and starting to get lots of indigestion. A friend in a natural mommy group suggested it. It's great safe and natural alternative to other brands on the market.
3707,Prong Training Collar,0/0,2.0,"I bought one Guardian prong collar, and one Sprenger prong collar for my 2 boxers. I wish I had bought 2 Sprenger collars instead. They are soooo much easier to get on and off the dogs. Should have known the Germans make the best products. :)"
3708,Christian Eyebrow Makeup Kit Eyebrow Makeup,0/0,5.0,This eyebrow kit is perfect. The stencils are gorgeous and the brow powder is semi permanent which is always a plus. Definitely recommend this eyebrow kit.
3709,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,0/0,4.0,Gillette does make the best blades. They are too expensive and they don't last but three shaves but that's fine.
3710,"Casbah Couscous, Lemon Spinach, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,1.0,"I received Casbah Hummus Mix instead of the Lemon Spinach Couscous I had ordered. I'm not quite sure how this happened, because the box said &#34;Hummus&#34; all over it, except for one little sticker that said Lemon Spinach Couscous... Tried the Hummus & I don't like it very much. But, if you add the juice from one lemon, some seasonings, and olive oil, then it tastes OK."
3711,Just Once - Kids' One Multistars,0/0,5.0,"My 1.5 year old loves these. I was a little worried that they would be too hard for her but she has no problem chewing them even though she only has 8 teeth :) Very good vitamin, happy I tried it."

3715,"Cadet Large Bull Stick Dog Chew, 1-Pound",0/0,5.0,Wanted large sticks to cut up for smaller dog. These are as advertised. Dogs love them. Meet all expectations. Would recommend to any pet owner.
3716,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my Australian cattledog a few months ago. She loves playing with this toy every single day. Not sure how something so simple is so entertaining for her...but it is. I stuff the squirrels in - she runs around with the tree and takes them out...then runs around with the squirrels flipping them in the air. Then she grabs the empty tree and shakes it around and brings it back to me for refilling. She enjoyed it so much that I bought one for my sister's dogs to play with.Buy it - you will be surprised how much your dog enjoys this toy.
3717,Dermalogica Stress Relief Treatment Oil,0/0,3.0,"I used to buy this product years ago and found it online so thought I would get some. For some reason, the smell of the oil is very faint and not as potent as it used to be, not sure if its been watered down?? Live and learn...."
3718,"3M Microfoam Foam Surgical Tape - 4"" wide",0/0,5.0,"The one inch wide tape is perfect for taping shut an eye that stays slightly open at night, which drys it out. I cut about an inch and half long piece and round the top (which goes on the lid), and gently attach the tape to the closed eyelid and cheek. Easy off too. It is gentler on the fragile skin around the eye than the paper tape. Would recommend highly for this purpose."
3719,"Rayovac ALD-12 UltraPRO Alkaline D Batteries, 12-Pack",0/0,4.0,I've been using Rayovac batteries for years and they keep getting better. The &#34;big brands&#34; may last a little longer but not long enough to make up for 4 less batteries in a pack.
3720,Pressman Toy Checkers Board Games,0/0,5.0,"Its cheap but then again what can you expect for $6 bucks shipped and all? It is what it is, a cheap but playable checkers game."
3721,Ulcer Ease Ulcer Ease Ulcerease Antiseptic Mouth Rinse,0/0,5.0,I got this product 10 years ago when I was undergoing chemo treatments. It healed my mouth ulcers faster than any product I've ever used. I still get it for mouth sores of any kind and the pain is gone the next day.
3722,Paula Dorf Lip Color Sheer Tint SPF 15,0/0,2.0,I love the color and have used it before but this product seems very dry on my lips so I have to mix it with lip moisturizer

3728,No7 Intensive Line Filler,1/1,1.0,I did not see any appreciable changes and I did find that the product had an unpleasant odor....like it was old and/or past it's expiration. Couldn't find the expiration date. Ended up not using the product.

3730,Deluxe Massage Wonder 8000A Shitasu Reflexology Rolling Foot Massager,0/0,5.0,"For me, I have several foot massager as I have some foot pain. This one is being the strongest and most powerful. Unlike other reviews, I feel this maasger is not painful at all and it's squeeze is strong. If ther is pain, it will be gone right after the massage or after you get used to. However, my mother has diabetes and she cannot use this massager. This massager maybe better for younger people and not senior citizen who has no experience with foot massager. It suits my need of a strong massage and help me to feel relax afterward. It is almost like drinking a cup of coffee. I feel like a get a boost of health and energy after using this massager."
3731,"Arrowhead Mills Whole Grain Puffed Millet Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",1/1,5.0,We're on the body ecology diet. Millet is one of the grains that is ok to eat (it doesn't feed yeast). I use kefir as my milk and eat this like a bowl of cereal every day for lunch. My favorite part of the work day!
3732,Rare ZZ Plant-Zamioculcas zamiifolia - House Plant - Bonsai,0/0,5.0,"I bought a zz plant a few years ago and read about how they're slow growers, prefers low light and very little water. I was happy when the plant came, it was healthy and fairly big. My plant took off, started growing fast and produced thick green leaves and new shoots. During winter I kept it in a south facing window and come summer it was outside on my patio where it got direct sun from morning till roughly 11am. The plant didn't burn and grew even better. Eventually I had relatives that wanted to know where I got it from and even a friend of my moms said that she used to see these in Poland. So i ordered more from this vendor. The plants are always healthy but this time around the plants were much smaller. I don't mind the smaller plants just because they grow quicker than i expected. If it gets no direct light and low indirect light it wont grow much and won't take much water. But during summer months I used fertilizer and Super Thrive and my plants grew pretty quickly. They do need a fair amount of water during summer months, but you'll be rewarded with a healthy and beautiful plant. In the winter months they do well in pretty much any part of the house. I've even plucked a couple leafs and started new plants in party cups. Its a great plant and I have no regrets what so ever."
3733,Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,0/0,4.0,"Easy to attach. Four stars only because they are also a little too easy to remove. However, they protected my nephew well as he decided that sitting on the fireplace hearth was his favorite place in our house."
3734,NELSON HOMEOPATHICS Calendula Cream 30 GM,0/0,2.0,It did not work for us at all. The one we got before from a different brand works better for us.

3738,Wen by Chaz Dean Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz.,0/0,5.0,would recommend for all hair types.my hair has a lot of body without any extra products. I don't use any other products when I wash my hair
3739,Elixir of Dreams Pillow Mist 3.6oz (100ml),0/0,4.0,"I love the scent of this! I expected it to have a more classic lavender scent- it does have more lemon or orange undertone than I was expecting. But all in all the scent is very refreshing and is really nice to have around me while sleeping. Even my husband complimented it, which is impressive because he normally doesn't notice much of anything ""perfume"" wise.I do think it helps me to relax at the end of the day, so I would purchase again.ETA"
3740,Clearasil Ultra Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream -- 1 oz,0/0,4.0,This product does help with last minute breakouts in combination with the face wash...great product will definitely purchase this product again.
3741,OPI Classics Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,OPI is famous for turning their colors over quickly which is not a good thing when you find that perfect color. I am glad that I could still find it and it was sent promptly.
3742,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,5.0,"This product seems to be pretty well made and easy to assemble. Most importantly, my baby loves it. She plays with and chews on all the attached toys. She jumps and jumps and many times rocks herself to sleep. This is great while we are getting ready for work in the mornings."
3743,Alpha Keri Moisture Rich Oil for Shower & Bath 16 fl oz (473.2 ml),0/0,5.0,Nice bath oil to put in a spray bottle to use after your shower. Nice light fragrance. Difficult to find in the store lately.
3744,The Buddy System Extra Buddy,0/0,5.0,Now I can walk with my dogs hands free. Great obedience training aid. I like the fact that the leash length is adjustable.
3745,"Buttermilk Powder, 1lb.",1/1,5.0,"I don't use buttermilk in a lot of recipes, so I don't usually keep it in stock in liquid form. I do use it from time to time, and so it is very handy to have it in powder form so that I can store it until I need it. I'll be buying this again."
3746,Earth Mama Angel Baby Angel Baby Lotion,0/0,4.0,"I like the smell of orange and vanilla, but the lotion can be a little greasy. I still enjoy the product though."
3747,"Calmoseptine diaper rash ointment tube - 4 oz, 6 pack",0/0,5.0,"This ointment helps from minor scratches , burns, all kind of skin allergies ! This is the best on our present market. I use it myself and suggested to all my friends. It is also safe for kids tender skin."
3748,200-Piece Wood Block Set with Tote,0/0,5.0,"My 2 year old son was given these as a hand-me-down gift from my youngest sister (15). He mostly just dumps them in and out of this mini wagon he has (which we now store them in, despite the cute little bag) but he loves them! The amazing thing is, these blocks are probably around 10 years old yet they are still in great shape even though my sister played with them often as a child. If you are looking for quality wooden blocks at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with these.And I've also read that Maxim guarantees that all of their products are lead free and sourced from renewable forests. That's a big plus in my book!"
3749,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,For perfect. No leaks. Love the pampers rewards program. Will stay with pampers until potty training. Will continue with mom program on amazon.
3750,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,ships fast.Better prices than most stores.I purchased the open box diapers and had no problems. The box was a little damaged but nothing major
3751,Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball,0/0,3.0,"I prefer this food distribution toy because its a soft, quiet rubber as opposed to other toys out there that are plastic and LOUD on the floor or when they bang in to the wall. The downside is the rubber rips pretty easily, and therefore its not really durable and would be AWFUL for a chew-y dog."
3752,"Rogaine for Women Hair Regrowth Treatment (2-Ounce Bottles, Pack of 3)",1/1,5.0,"Amazing product!Every woman fears the time of her life when our precious hair falls out. I noticed more and more strands falling out around the time I turned 30. I'm 50 now (Ssh! Don't tell anyone!) and I thought there was no hope left for my hair. Today, my hair is thick and just the way I like it. It's my own hair, that I grew! I would recommend this product to anyone with progressing hair loss. It works!I was skeptical at first, as it took about 4 weeks for improvement to show, but two months later I'm loving my hair every single day!"
3753,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"The only thing you may consider is to order a big larger size than it recommended.For example, we used size 6 back since my son was less than the weight range recommended by the instruction."
3754,"Solgar - Magnesium Citrate, 120 tablets",1/1,5.0,"I had been doing considerable research regarding the human body's need for magnesium and how it is now lacking in our systems in today's fast-food world. I have been taking this product for about one week, and I do feel great! It is a total WOW moment! The product arrived promptly and was well packaged. I think the price reflects the quality. I will order this product repeatedly!"
3755,Spornette #855 Italian Collection Jumbo Round Hair Brush,1/1,4.0,"The brush is a one piece construction, which means there is nothing that will randomly grab and pull your hair. I have a conair brush, but it's a two piece construction. I have long hair and my hair always got caught and wrapped up in the conair brush. Very frustrating. The brush is great for the ends of my hair, or just basic styling - however, it doesn't exactly grab your hair enough to do just a basic brush out and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. It is very gently on your hair, one piece wooden construction is perfect...but I do have to have a different brush to make sure my hair is brushed out and ready for styling"
3756,Topix Replenix Purifying Antioxidant Foaming Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"My wife's dermatologist recommended this and gave her a sample, apparently it works well cause she is not complaining..and as we all know, if momma ain't happy ain't nobody happy..lol."
3757,"Gillette Mach3 Razor Blade Refill Cartridges For Men, # 8559 - 12 Ea",0/0,5.0,"Thisroduct was really cheaper, it works as it said, its really good, i always use this kind of blades since i was a teenager"
3758,Taam Rio Plus 1100 Aqua Pump and Powerhead - 382 GPH,0/0,5.0,"A powerful but quiet pump. Works well as powerhead for UGF, or as submerged pump. Includes a variety of attachments for various configurations and pumping purposes.Only complaint is that combining venturi for bubbling effect with valve and water direction flap does not work well together - it is either valve or bubbles, not both."
3759,Petstages Cheese Chase Ball Track for Cat Toy,0/0,3.0,"One of my cats loves the Turbo Scratcher, so I grabbed one of these for him, too. Except he doesn't view this as an equal. In fact, he never plays with this. He just stares at it, sniffs it, and walks away.Until I give them catnip. Then this is the greatest toy on the planet. They lay there with their little stoned expressions and hit this thing until their high wears off. I guess it's a little disappointing that they don't like it unless they're on catnip, but at least they play it with sometimes."
3760,Covidien - Uni-patch Pre-Tens Conductive Skin Preparation Pre-Treatment skin prep - 2 oz bottle,0/0,5.0,Use this product with my tens unit for therapy on sore muscles. Muscle pulls and it does exactly what it should.
3761,Bird's Custard Powder 300g,0/0,5.0,"It makes such a tasty change from ice cream with your dessert pie! Served hot or cold (try not to fight over the 'skin' that the milk makes with it!) It is a vanillary, creamy sweet sauce. Very easy to make, but DO follow the instructions; it really does make all the difference even if they seem a bit odd! It is always good as a layer on your 'trifle', over jello, brownies, or indeed anything sweet that you feel could use just that little &#34;extra&#34;!"
3762,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black",0/0,4.0,"The Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor is a decent weapon for the price when it comes to fighting the battle of the bulge. It provides an important window into body fat composition that a regular scale does not. (Of course, you could just purchase a scale that does the same thing.) But it could be better.The initial setup is rather straight forward, but there's a lot of subjectivity when it comes to choosing the ""FIT"" level (a part of the initial setup that determines whether the user should select the ""Normal"" or ""Athlete"" setting.) Since there are 8 user memory settings, I chose to set up 1 slot with ""Normal"", and a second slot with ""Athlete"" just to see the difference. What I found was that the fat % figure was around 3% lower on the Athlete setting, while the BMI figure was identical.Obviously, since this isn't a scale, you have to weigh yourself on an accurate scale first in order to input that information into the HBF-306C's initial setup (and keep updating that figure to keep the readout of this device accurate as well).I found that using the device is pretty straight forward, with one possible exception"
3763,Lee Kum Kee Minced Ginger - 7.5 oz.,1/1,5.0,"Even though I live in Montana and never want to leave, I do miss the ubiquity of good Chinese food restaurants in San Francisco. Because I pride myself on being able to cook my own versions of various foods I like, I knew I needed minced ginger for the sheer amount of Asian dishes that require it.I've already used it in several recipes and the flavor is nice and strong. Just like when I buy containers of minced garlic (something that is FAR easier to find in your average Montana grocery store), I tend to buy enough to last me for a decent amount of time. This 7.5oz jar will likely last me until sometime in the new year. By then I'll have $25 in my cart so that this will ship with it (The add-on program is perfect for stuff like this)."
3764,Jenga - 2006 Edition,0/0,3.0,The round container ...really?...it just doesnt workWe love the game anyway. My son just takes extra time to set it up
3765,Melissa & Doug Alphabet Train Floor Puzzle,1/1,3.0,I have had much better experience with other Melissa & Doug products. The train set is not bad but I rate it only 3* since it is not something that will grab a toddler's attention for more than 15 minutes. And not something he would want to go back and play with.
3766,"Mistral Foam Bath in 7 Scents, 8.4 fl oz",0/0,5.0,"Smells wonderful.A must buy for people who like to take bath.I really love their product, will definitely come back and get more."
3767,"Thayer Witch Hazel Toner AF w/Aloe Vera Formula Vitamin E, Lavender 12 oz",0/0,5.0,The lavender scent is relaxing and the witch hazel does what it is supposed to do. it tones and moisturizes the skin without alcohol ingredients. I use this after every shave and sometimes throughout the day to freshen up.
3768,D.A.P. Dog Appeasing Pheromone Spray (60ml),0/0,5.0,"excellent product, when i leaved my dog used to be so sad, now he stays calms withou making any damage"
3769,Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,0/1,1.0,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product. I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old. So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid. What a waste!"
3770,Majestic Pet Crate Pet Bed Mat,0/0,4.0,Liked it till the puppy ate it! She thought it was pretty fun. :) was not impressed by the description of Color though charcoal it is not it looks more greyish beige.
3771,"Ahmad Tea Apricot Sunrise Black Tea, 20 Tea Bags Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is my favorite tea! I cannot find apricot tea ta my local grocery store, and I am so pleased to be able to order it online. English Breakfast has traditionally been my other favorite tea, but I think I like this tea even more."

3775,"Flying Machine Kit, 17"" Wingspan",0/0,4.0,"These are great fun to fly with the toddler grandkids, especially at the airport viewing stand. They are somewhat fragile when playing with little kids, but I knew that before I bought them. The kids really get a kick out of them."
3776,Mother-to-be Maternity Support Medium,0/0,5.0,This has helped my already bad back but not until around the 6 month mark. It slides around alot before that. But definately worth the money paid for those last 3 months.
3777,"Revlon Illuminance Creme Shadow, 4 Shades, Not Just Nudes - 1 set",0/0,4.0,Good eyeshadow. I like that it goes on easy and stays put. Pretty colors. My go-to eye shadow when I'm in a hurry because of ease of use.

3781,The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling,0/0,4.0,I bought this for a friends baby shower. She uses it every day. Her and her baby love it! It's perfect for them. I just wish it would've came in a more secure box.
3782,1/55 D/C AH-64 Apache Helicopter,0/2,3.0,This item was purchased as a gift and was not what I expected. I returned it for the item I wanted.

3786,Leonidas Belgian Chocolates,0/0,5.0,Fresh and beautifully presented. Flavorful superior grade chocolate.I have sent these as gifts also and they are always well recieved.
3787,Melissa & Doug Pets Jumbo,0/0,1.0,"Disappointed with the quality of this puzzle. Our had paper on top, not paint, which quickly started deteriorating. The board itself and the pieces are layered fiber particle board. I don't know how the folks at Melissa and Doug think something like this will last, especially at this age when kids chew on everything. Also, the toxicity of the inks on the paper and the glues in the particle board concern me. Paint on toys has to meet certin requirements, but I don't know if the inks on paper do. My son received this for his first birthday, and unfortunately he only got to play with it once before we had to put it up. I ordered some wooden puzzles by Hape with non toxic paint that I am hoping of are better quality."
3788,Lee's Super Algae Scrubber w/Handle for Glass Tanks - Coarse,2/2,4.0,"The more products I try from Lee's the more impressed I am with the quality and value. A long time hobbyist of 35 years - it seems the battle against Algae is one that will rage on indefinatley. This scrubber is excellent, good and coarse spun nylon it makes removal as much of a breeze as possible, it's great for the sides and bottom - using the edge is perfect for those hard to reach places.A few of my tanks get indirect sunlight so for those it's a weekly effort and I'll be buying more of these so I have one for most of my tanks. Which BTW, is important especially if you keep a variety of different species in seperate aquariums. Cross contamination has long been linked to the dreaded toxic tank syndrome so best to have gear that's dedicated to one specific tank."
3789,Eye Wrinkle Cream 0.5 oz by Dr. Eckstein,0/0,5.0,"This eye cream not only doesn't irritate your eyes but it will take care of your wrinkles and puffiness! It also gives you a nice glow around your eyes. Keeps the thin skin around the eyes moisturized, I hope it's not too greasy to wear during hot and humid months."
3790,"Now Foods, L-Glutamine 1500 mg",0/0,5.0,I was buying this from a local health shop for double the price and half the product. I'm very pleased this product.
3791,Revolving Playing Card Tray/Holder For 6 Decks,0/0,1.0,"The ball bearings that allow the holder to turn easy keep falling out. We are able to use it, but it is a pain. I lost all the packing material and paper work so we just use it as it is."
3792,"Viactiv Calcium (500mg) plus Vitamins D & K, Chocolate Mint, 60-Count Soft Chews",0/0,5.0,These taste just like candy! They are full of calcium and vitamin D - which I need as a supplement. They do not taste like a vitamin at all! LOVE THEM!
3793,Melissa & Doug See-Inside Alphabet Peg Puzzle,0/0,5.0,This is a great puzzle for toddlers. It allows then to learn there alphabet while they play. I was surprised how quickly my daughter picked up on her letters using this puzzle.
3794,Panasonic Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries - 8 Pack,0/0,5.0,"I'm a diehard Duracell user, there, I said it! But, these Panasonic's are bar none in electronic devices. I was rather amazed to see how much better my wireless components worked and, they're not sluggish, the batteries last longer, and well, life is even more faster now that it was with the Duracells. I'm going to be using these only now for our electronics -there's just entirely too much difference in using regular Duracells when compared to these. Highly, highly recommend!"
3795,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,2/10,3.0,i thought that i was getting a rather good price on the Batteries and a few days after ordering them found them cheaper locally.
3796,The Sing And Read CD,0/0,5.0,"I have used this CD for several years in my Kindergarten class. It really helps the students learn that letters make words. They memorize the songs and before they know it, they are spelling words!"
3797,Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader? Game,0/0,4.0,"I should have investigated the game more before purchasing. The product itself was just like you'd buy it off the shelf, but the game's concept and content left much to be desired."
3798,Zinc for Acne 100 Tablets,1/1,4.0,"It took close to a month, but this product really works as described. My skin looks really clear and my friends have noticed too. Didn't notice much improvement for scalp, hair, or nails though."
3799,Aliens - Panther Alien,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this panther Alien from the Kenner series to replace one I previously had over 13 years ago. I think it's one of the best sculpts and designs of the entire line. My order arrived very quickly and I was surprised at the quality of it's box as well. This was a gift for someone else, so it won't be staying in the box, but a collector would appreciate it's packaged state. Looks great and I'm very happy to be reunited with this toy."
3800,Parfums de Coeur Body Fantasies Pear Fantasy Body Spray,0/0,5.0,"I like it because it's not strong like perfume, it's just subtle and nice. Gotten lots of compliments about the way I smell."
3801,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,5.0,"This seems like a very well made mirror, it is a nice size, and the magnification strength is great. It is easy to install, and the nickel finish is very classy. The one thing, though, particularly after reading another reviewer's comment, is that I make a habit of tightening the screws on either side of the mirror from time to time ... just seems to make sense, considering that the mirror gets rotated back and forth quite a bit."
3802,"Eureka Tub Of Letter Tiles, 176 Tiles in 3 3/4"" x 5 1/2"" x 3 3/4"" Tub",1/1,4.0,"I have no big complaints about these tiles. They are used almost daily in my classroom and all the tiles have retained their letters. I have had other sets that had the paint wear away with frequent use, but these look great. I have even washed them in soapy water a couple times, and they hold up well. The capital &#34;I&#34; doubles as a lowercase &#34;l&#34; which I did not like, so I used a sharpie to add extra lines. Also, the capital &#34;M&#34; is simply an upside down &#34;W&#34; which I do not prefer. I wish the capital &#34;ms&#34; had staright outside lines instead of slanting lines. I could not alter the W's to correct the problem, but overall, I am still happy with this purchase. NOTE"
3803,Flents Sports Band - Elastic Eyeglass Holder for Active People,0/0,1.0,Nice design that was poorly made. For a few more cents these could have been a great band. My glasses are always slipping off my nose and face. The elastic at the temple end of the band is so flimsy that they will not hold onto the temple bar of the glasses.
3804,Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - 1.25 Ounce Tube,0/0,5.0,"I have dry skin, and i've tried almost every commercial moisturizer there is over the decades. My requirements are threefold"
3805,Natural Match 5W Medium Golden Brown Women's Hair Color,0/0,5.0,Covers gray spectacularly. Lots of shine. So sorry this is discontinued. Do not understand why Loreal stopped making this. Have tried all of the newer products and they are inferior. This does last (as claimed)-4-6 weeks although I usually wait until 7 weeks have passed. Seller was superquick with shipping and great price. Hope I can continue to obtain this.Would highly recommend as this doesn't dry out or wreck my hair as many other products out there do.
3806,Nature's Answer Perio Wash,3/3,5.0,"This has so many great herbs that I highly recommend it. Amazon use to have it for $6 but they it's upped to $11. Not sure why the change, but I can definitely say its an awesome product that everyone should have"
3807,"Hershey's Baking Pieces, Cinnamon Chips, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,great for baking and gifts -- perfect for the fall but don't restrict their use. Especially good in snickerdoodles. jb
3808,James Meger O Holy Night 1500Pc Jigsaw Puzzle,0/0,3.0,I'm in the process of assembly.. the 5 star reviews are... well interesting.... puzzling is my main hobby and if you look at my reviews i am in a constant state of assembling puzzles... when i finish one i immediately start another... i decoupage and foam core mount all my puzzles and usually don't assemble any puzzle twice... the product picture is beautiful and that picture is what attracted me... my problem with this puzzle is that there is only ONE puzzle shape... a 2 knob piece... sometimes its taller sometimes shorter sometimes the knobs are not parallel but with only one shape this make assembly very tedious... and since this is a small 1500 piece puzzle the pieces are also small.... i have 2 assembly areas one in my shop which will easily handle a 9000 piece puzzle i have one on going now and a puzzle area in my rec room that will handle up to 1500 piece puzzles (i can just squeeze a 2000 in this area but it makes it more difficult)... i'm not arguing with the 5 star reviews we all have our own opinions about what makes a good puzzle.... you now have mine... if the thought of assembling a 1500 piece puzzle that has many similar areas by visual cue only is for you then give it a try... i am... however if you have been puzzling a long time with standard puzzle shapes you may find dealing with only one puzzle shape frustrating... i did....
3809,ORGANZA For Women By GIVENCHY Eau de Parfum Spray,0/0,1.0,I was so upset when i received my package. Amazon was very misleading in their marketing of Givenchy Organza idecence. I was under the impression that i ordered Indecence but was delivered plain Givenchy Organza. Amazon will not accept perfume returns. I feel completely duped and disappointed as i am a very good customer.

3814,"Flensted Mobiles Nursery Mobiles, Sheep Mobile",0/0,5.0,"I love Flensted mobiles, I bought one a few years ago for our house and when we were expecting a baby I immediately knew I'd want one of these for the nursery (and not some froo-froo baby mobile). Plus babies only see in black & white at first so this was perfect! Our nursery is a little funkier than ""the norm"" I suppose, but we hung this over the crib until we started sleep training. We've since moved it to her bathroom so it wasn't a distraction. But she still loves to go in the bathroom and look at it, grab for it, watch it spin around.The quality is great, the sheep are made of plastic. But it is a delicate mobile, so one fast-enough grab from baby hands and there is potential for damage. I actually consider these to be art and I hope they are in our house for a long time (we have 3!)."
3815,African Shea Butter Cream 100% Pure & Raw Gold 5 0z,0/0,5.0,Came very early! great shipping the shea butter does not smell bad at all smells like earth and nature. Makes hand feel silky soft :) definitely buy!!!

3817,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,Pampers Baby Dry are the only diapers that work. Leaks galore with all the others and we literally bought every brand imaginable. These are the clear winner.
3818,"Tweezerman Nose, Ear, Facial Hair Scissor Tweezers",0/0,4.0,"I bought these scissors for two main reasons. One of the reasons was that they are compact and easy to keep with my electric shaver when grooming to help even out the facial hair. The other reason was the rounded tips to utilize for spots that I'd otherwise nick myself.These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts. These scissors are absolutely tiny! As a result, you can't really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears. For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair. This thing just isn't big enough to do the job. It's nonetheless a great buy for convenience if you like to groom very carefully and personally, and the rounded tips ensure no nicks!"
3819,Conair Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron,0/0,4.0,"ProsHeat up very fast. It takes less than a minute to get it highest temp.Clip is good, you don't get hair stuck between like other products I have used before.ConsThe power button is on the handle, and it goes on and off easily while you are holding the grip.This is very annoying. I put my hair in the desired position, then Hold for 5-10 seconds, but find out my hair didn't get curl because I pushed the power button to off not intentionally, and I have to do it over again.I wish they put the power button somewhere you don't have to grab when you are using it, or make it a switch instead of button."

3826,ORGANZA For Women By GIVENCHY Eau de Parfum Spray,0/0,1.0,I was so upset when i received my package. Amazon was very misleading in their marketing of Givenchy Organza idecence. I was under the impression that i ordered Indecence but was delivered plain Givenchy Organza. Amazon will not accept perfume returns. I feel completely duped and disappointed as i am a very good customer.
3827,"Graco Quattro Tour Duo Stroller, Rittenhouse",0/0,4.0,"My wife and I bought this stroller for walks, and it works great. we haven't had any problems with it technically, but we did notice the juice holders and plastics are not very sturdy. You just have watch out when storing and putting away, don't bang the plastics or they will break."
3828,Red Door By Elizabeth Arden For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,1.0,Red Door is my favorite scent. I've used it for years. But this particular bottle is not the same. I saw someone else state that this smelled different in the 3.3 ounce compared to the 1.7 and smaller bottles. I thought they had to be mistaken. But they were right. This bottle does not smell the same.
3829,Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica,1/1,5.0,I find this product to be a must in my life these days. Seems to help control my type 2 diabetes and blodd preasure. I mix with a little juice in the morning as it is not the best tasting - but well worth the effort.

3832,Melissa & Doug Classic Deluxe Kitchen,1/1,1.0,"Melissa and Doug should be embarrassed. Either they are getting too big to care or they are too small to know any better, either way I ordered this product and it was shipped to me with only about 70% of the parts. Really, how does this even pass weight inspection to get shipped? Where is the QC?Melissa and Doug? Maybe Scrooge and The Grinch! This was going to be my hero present this year...thanks a lot."
3833,OPTP # 702 The Original Mckenzie Lumbar Roll - Firm Density,0/0,5.0,"I know people complain it's too firm, but that's the way it's suppose to be if you want it to do its job. It does take a little getting used to, but once you do, it really helps with lower back pain."
3834,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Cranky the Crane,0/0,5.0,"The prices for this item are all over the place in local stores and Internet, but this was the best buy by far. Couldn't be happier.

3837,Lansinoh Double Electric Breast Pump,0/1,1.0,I bought this pump despite bad reviews and I regretted it from day one. The pump NEVER worked properly and nothing I did would make it work the way that it should. I was never able to get any milk out with this pump. I highly recommend a Medela Pump In Style Advanced pump. Don't waste your money on one of these to try to save some money.
3838,Stork Craft Hoop Glider & Ottoman,0/0,4.0,"We looked at several glider and ottoman combos in stores and they all exceeded $350. We wanted a good quality and stylish chair however for something we are not planning on using for more than a year could not justify the price being charged in stores. We purchased this set from Amazon and were very pleased with the delivery time, quality and ease of assembly. It is a perfect size for a nursery, very comfortable and made of quality materials and is a great value."
3839,Rc Killer Whale Electric Dual Motor Speed Boat Colors May Vary,1/1,1.0,"Bought this to play around in the lagoon behind our house, mostly just a drainage pond.The boat went really fast and I even purchased the extra battery. After 10 minutes of use the battery died, put in the other charged battery and nothing. Charged up original battery and tried it, still nothing. Sent back for a return, purchased another one and same thing. These boats are typical China junk. Don't waste your money or time."

3852,Playskool Busy Gears,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my son when he was 6 mos old for his first Christmas. He loved watching it and playing with the gears. One year later at 18 mos, my son still loves this toy and now knows how to take the gears off and place them back on and stack them, etc. It is such a great little toy that keeps him entertained. I was worried about his fingers getting caught in it when he was just a baby, but it is super sensitive and stops turning as soon as you touch a gear. Pretty cool. Durable, cute, and I would guess it will be one of his faves for a long time. Also, we play with this toy ALL the time and I think I have only had to replace the batteries once in one year."
3853,DIAMONDS & EMERALDS By ELIZABETH TAYLOR Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,"I have been wearing White Diamond for year's now so i thought i'd try some of Elizabeth taylor's other purfumes so i ordered the Diamonds and Emeralds and i'm really happy i did! I love the smell and i've had many complements on the smell as well. Thank you very much for my order, it is very well appreciated!! Brenda Robarge (masonj)."
3854,Petmate Kennel Cab,1/1,3.0,"I ordered 2 of these for two separate places... for convenience. I looked into several different crates. This one was the most reasonably priced. A comparable crate was twice the money at Petco. It is a very lightweight, light duty kennel. It would not be one to use for a bigger dog or heavy use. My toy poodle is 10 pounds, however, they need to be able to stand and turn inside the crate so this was the smallest crate I could use, even though it notes &#34;ok&#34; for dogs 20 to 25 pounds... I would question that. It arrived as agreed and in good condition. I will say that you really need 4 hands to put together as it is flimsy to hold and try to clip. Because of how it clips with plastic clips it will not withstand abuse."

3857,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again."
3858,Pravana Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment 10.1oz,0/0,4.0,"a bit expensive for the product, and if you have to pay shipping it is very expensive, I am sure you can buy something of equal quality or better in the store"
3859,"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Pink",0/0,5.0,"Works well, though I wonder if the head piece part could be made a little differently to accommodate the parts of the car seat that need to come down for sunshades, etc. Gives our little girl a cushy place to sit in because the car seat can be cold otherwise."

3861,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,1/1,1.0,"I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS of the electrical transformer not working or failing shortly after first using, however, I chose ignore the negative comments because of the high percentage of good reviews. I hooked up the track and transformer exactly as per the instructions. Nothing happened. I used a volt meter to check the output power. Not only was there no power to the track, the whistle did not worked on the transformer either. I called the Lionel ""Customer Service"" number listed on the assembly instructions. A recording said I was number 9 in line. I waited OVER TWO HOURS until I finally got down to the #2 position in line. I waited for another 20 minutes and still no one answered so I finally gave up. Lionel is NOT the company it used to be. With all the negative reviews in regard to a faulty electric transformer, and now with my own personal experience, I am suspect on just how safe (fire, shock, etc) an electric transformer with multiple failures really is. I am not going to have an unsafe electrical device around my grandchildren."

3876,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,1.0,"I had heard wonderful things about gentle leaders and the first time I used it on my little rescue dog it worked like a charm, at first. But somehow she was always able to either get out of it or loosen it by the time we got back home so I thought I had it on wrong (it's true that it has to be much tighter and higher than you would expect). I had it refit twice, by both the vet and her trainer at obedience school. I finally figured out that the initial fit was not the problem but it was that the adjustment buckle doesnt hold the nylon strap tight enough--so that's why she can loosen it while it's on (I marked the right fit with a black pen so I could tell when it had slipped). I only confirmed it was a problem specific to this purchase when I recently bought another one at REI and found that the nylon did not slip through the buckle nearly as easily. I actually think the nylon in the new one feels totally different. It's hard to know whether the problem is the material (my vote) or the buckle but either way, this one is useless. SInce it took me so long to figure out what the problem was, now it's too late for me to return this one-- hopefully people will read this and not experience the same hassles that I did..."

3878,Mally Beauty Lip Fence,0/0,2.0,I don't see a difference in the way the lipstick adheres. It appears to be the same with or without the lip fence. Not recommended. Expensive for no results.
3879,Neocell Laboratories Super Collagen Plus C,0/0,5.0,"After just a few days of use, I really couldn't live without it! This combined with &#34;Hydraplenish&#34; hyaluronic acid every morning is the only thing that has worked for my stiff aching joints. I feel like a new woman and have recommended to everyone I know that suffers from the aches and pains of arthritis."
3880,Solvit 62314 Waterproof Hammock Seat Cover for Pets,1/1,5.0,"It has proved to be the best thing I have bought in a long time. Having recently purchased a new car, I was thrilled to see how it saved the upholstery on the back seat. So easy to attach and also remove to shake out dog hair. Saved my dog falling off the seat too when I've had to brake quickly for any reason. Great product, would recommend it for any dog owner."

3882,Simply Saline Sterile Saline Nasal Mist,0/0,5.0,I found out from my doctor that the nasal sprays at the drug stores (other than saline) cause more stuffiness if used for more than about 5 days. The chemicals used cause &#34;rebound.&#34; He recommended saline (salt) sprays as they don't cause &#34;rebound.&#34; He's right. Saline is the way to go.
3883,Bijan Wicked Eau de Toilette for Women by Bijan,0/0,5.0,"One of my favorite scents. It is Bijan's best to me, very sexy and gets comments all the time. I have been buying this for years and the price now is ridiculously cheap compared to years ago. A steal of a deal."

3885,Badger Basket Doll Bunk Beds With Ladder - Pink/White,0/0,4.0,"I purchased one a year ago for a 7,4 and 2 year old. It has held up very well. Grampa had to replace one of the bottoms when the now 5 year old sat on it, but that would be expected. He was amazed about how easily he could take it back apart to make the necessary repairs. This purchase is for a 6 year old.I also purchased 2 of the sets with the wardrobe on the bottom and the bed on top. My son remarked about how well built this was."
3886,"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick Pearl, .15-Ounces (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,I can say that this lipstick leaves them soft. Also this colour looks great on every skin colour. Try it.
3887,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,3.0,"For years my family has been using an old broken tv from the 80s which doesn't produce tv images but produces a static sound that's very soothing and blocks out noise from the outside. It's begun to malfunction. The last time we unplugged it, it was very hard to get it to come back on. It finally did, but I think it may be on its last legs. We turn up the volume fairly loud to block out noises from outside. I'm looking to replace this. The Dohm got better reviews than any other product. I love the sound it makes. It's a very soothing, clean sound of whooshing air running through the machine. It looks durable and it doesn't have any distracting lights that would interfere with sleeping. However it just can't compete with the old tv as far as volume goes. You can adjust the volume somewhat, but even at its highest setting, it's just not as loud as even a fan is. People talk about its sound ""filling a room"". Maybe a tiny closet? I don't think I could even hear it at its highest setting if I was on the other side of the bedroom from it. I think the only way this is going to replace the old tv is if we got 3 or 4 of them and maybe their combined volume would be enough? So I'm disapointed with the volume of it very much because it's way too quiet. I don't see how this could block out the noise of a dog barking outside, sirens, etc. at all because of the low volume. The sound itself is very nice though. I think it would be good for an office or if you were travelling."
3888,AMBU CPR POCKET RESCUE MASK W/ O2 INLET,0/0,5.0,"I had used a rescue mask in CPR training on a few occasions and felt like it would be a good idea to keep one in the car. This came in a very sturdy case which is important when stuffed in my emergency back pack. More importantly is that the quality of the mask itself is much higher than the one used in class. When practicing, it is much easier to achieve a good seal. Also, it comes with a set of gloves and cleaning swipe which is all you need for the first time you use it.Overall, I would recommend this product to friends."
3889,Philips Sonicare E-Series Replacement Brush Head,0/0,5.0,These brushes arrived well packaged & asadvertised. They are of high quality & verywell made. Each has a tiny ring color codedfor individual identity.
3890,High Performance Ripped-Man,0/0,5.0,Waited for the weekend to hit before I swallow these during the week; wanted to see the effects. Definatley does something for my metabolism. I don't feel like snacking during the day. Almost like feeling no hunger at all. Went to the gym after taking them and felt fine. Feel a little hotter while doing cardio but a little more sweat never hurt anyone.
3891,Tommy Kono TK Knee Bands,0/0,3.0,"Like others have written, my knee band ripped right along the sleeve going almost halfway up. I had the bands for about 8 months before that happened. Until the rip though they were great. I was hoping for more longevity out them."

3893,"""The Claw"" Electronic Candy Grabber Machine Arcade Game",0/0,4.0,"Got this as a joke/for fun for my boyfriend. He loves it and we have had almost no issues with the claw not working properly. The chain got stuck once and we couldn't get it to pull up for a minute, but we tilted it around a little to get it unstuck and that seemed to work fine. All in all I feel that I got a good deal."
3894,"Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix, 4-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"I don't rate products much, but this morning I had the best biscuits ever. Wife and son are gluten, egg, dairy and soy free. We used to love biscuits and gravy but since they went gluten free years ago we haven't had them. We have used Pamela's for pancakes but this morning I decided to try biscuits and gravy... Fantastic. I used butter instead of shortening (soy) and rice milk for both the biscuits and sausage gravy. Did I mention they were fantastic!"
3895,Soft Touch Sectional Pelican Clips 6/pkg,0/0,2.0,"These clips are hard plastic, not the soft silicon advertised. That being said, they sort of do their job of holding your hair but they are super hard and your hair tends to fall out. I only use them when curling my hair so they will work. Also they are a good price."
3896,PetzLife Oral Care Gel 4oz Salmon Oil,0/0,4.0,"I have used this product for about the past year on my 12+ year old aussie. It does seem to help, but you do have to follow the instructions and keep up with it. It doesn't clean their teeth like a dental cleaning but I think using it is soothing and does keep the bacteria lower which helps infections from setting in."

3898,Lamaze My First Fishbowl,1/1,5.0,"I bought this after my baby didn't want to part with a friend's! The little creatures are cute and each do something different and I like that at first its just something to chew on, then as baby grows they realize they can squeeze, shake, or rattle the toys to make noise, then they get a little older and they figure out how to put them in and take them out of the little fish tank! Everything is soft and any aged baby can safely play with this toy!"
3899,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,2.0,"I bought this brand because of all of the glowing reviews here, and I'm not happy about that decision. I wanted a light brown (not dark, like chocolate) frosting for my son's birthday cake. I didn't want to make it chocolate, and, as I said, I didn't want it very dark anyway. So, I bought the Warm Brown.I did a test run of his cake today. I made my frosting and added in a couple of drops of the paste. It was basically pink. Well, brownish-pink, but way too pink. I thought that maybe I needed more to get closer to the color on the sticker that is on the cap. So, I added some more. Still too pink. So I added still more. By the time I had finished, it was slightly more brown, but still had way too much of a pink undertone for what I was looking for. And it really wasn't close to the colored sticker on the bottle.I'm pretty disappointed. Perhaps it is just this brown color that is the problem and that the others are great. But, the Wilton colors I have so far have met my expectations much better than this. I am glad that I did a trial run on the birthday cake. I think that I will have to go for chocolate frosting after all, using cocoa to get the color I want."

The Fridge Phonics gizmo made the process fun and stress-free for our son, and he picked up on it much earlier than we would have expected. My sister bought this for him for Christmas when he was 18 months old. He knew all the letter names and sounds (including short and long vowel sounds) by his second birthday.

Smells good and works really well -- I use it as a conditioner on my scalp and use either hair conditioner or dry oil on the ends of my hair. Makes my hair and scalp beautiful and healthy."
3904,Classic,1/1,3.0,"This is what it is, its chapstick and a necessity for the cold winter months. I dont really see any benefit going with this chapstick over a competitor besides the price."

3909,"Heath Outdoor Products DD-20 Fancy Suet Cake, Case of 16",0/0,3.0,"While the birds love these a lot, you have to use twice as many as normal due to their thinness; two fit inside a normal holder.As I am able to get a block that is twice as thick for the same price at the local T rue V alue store, I will not get these again."

3911,"Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor Blends for Coffee, French Vanilla, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,I use this or the Hazelnut flavor and love them both! I don't think I can go back to 'regular' Splenda
3912,"Large Wooden See Inside ABC Puzzle, 26-Piece",0/0,2.0,"My daughter loves this puzzle, but I'm annoyed with it.My daughter is 20 months and we bought this as a hands-on way to learn letters. She likes this puzzle more than she likes her Melissa and Doug animals puzzle, possibly because it has more pieces. She picks a letter, I tell her something like, ""H is for HATS"" and she finds the hats and tries to put the letter in.This is the part that annoys me"
3913,Sentry HC Groom'n Comb/with Catnip Pouch,0/0,1.0,"I can tell that my cat would love this item if he could only use it but I could not get it to stick on the wall, even with extra adhesive supports. As soon as my cat rubbed against it, it detached and fell off the wall."
3914,"Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste, 4 fl. oz.",0/0,5.0,This brings out the flavor better than vanilla flavoring. Realy love this.Was shipped very quickly. The price was very reasonable.

3918,ThinkFun Zingo,0/0,5.0,I couldn't believe that my 2 and half year old son played this game with my 6 year old nephew and my 4 year old nephew. They loved it.
3919,Wahl Professional 8685 Peanut Classic Clipper/trimmer,0/0,4.0,i selected four stars because i can't bring myself to say i love a trimmer. i am very satisfied with it. it does what i bought it to do. i would recommend it as a small trimmer.
3920,"Tetra Whisper Power Filter 60, 60-Gallon",0/0,1.0,"The seller is good. My comment is on the product. I have a 10 gallon fiter, the same brand, and it is really a whisper. So I thought it is a good brand and I will get a bigger one, but the 60 gallon filter is not a whisper, it is a B-52. When cow hears it, it will stop producing milk! Besides, I have a 20 gallon tank, it takes overnight to make the water clear. It will probably take a year to make a 60 gallon tank water clear."
3921,Graco Bumper Jumper,0/0,3.0,"A little confusing to adjust and needs to be readjusted each time it's used. Unfortunately my daughter really wasn't crazy about this. She would go to town for about 5 minutes before she would want to get out. Bummer, I really wanted her to love a jumper so I could have 15 minutes to myself. The jumper does seem very stable and I was never worried about it falling or tipping with her in it."
3922,Glytone Glytone Retexturize Body Lotion,0/0,3.0,"I should have followed my instincts on this after reading the reviews of the other Glytone lotion, ""Glytone Body Lotion, 8.4-Ounce Package,"" where folks had issues with the pump breaking. Well, mine broke right off the bat out of the box, after I tried to use it for the first time, tonight. Still anxious to give the actual product a chance, I unscrewed the pump base and pulled some of the lotion out to rub on, but found that the creamy texture is an awful sticky petroleum based lotion - I feel like a lubed ball joint. I admit that I don't have KP, and I was only seeking the preventative benefits of this lotion, but I think I'm better off ""sticking"" to my coconut oil. This product should certainly be only used at bedtime. If you use it before getting dressed for the day, you may never get your clothes to fit right. If I get a rash, this product is going right back to Amazon. I'm holding out hope for the SPF version - I'll try that, tomorrow, but will allow plenty of time, just in case I need to jump back into the shower."
3923,"Fawne Fawn Mini Flopsie 8"" by Aurora",0/0,4.0,"I bought this little stuffed fawn for my sister's baby shower diaper cake. Totally cute and cuddly. The only thing I didn't like was that the moose was in the photo, and I immediately thought I was getting the moose (SUPER cute) but it wasn't until I re-read the title of the item that it was just the little fawn. Shipped really fast and I would buy from this seller again. To get the moose this time :)"

3926,Nexcare Skin Crack Care .24 fluid ounces (7-ml),0/0,3.0,My husband gets awful cracks from working outdoors and we were excited when we saw this product. It helped but wasn't a miracle cure. I think that a good hand creme applied many times a day works just as well. He also applies creme and wraps his fingers overnight. That seems to help the most.
3927,Bauerfeind MalleoTrain Ankle Support,0/0,4.0,"Very good construction. Recommended by Dr, made a big difference in how my ankles were feeling.I would recommend them"

3929,Mens Tel Time Chrome Talking Watch with White Dial Expansion Band,1/1,5.0,"I purchased this watch for my father who has macular degeneration. Because of his low vision, he is unable to set the watch himself. Setting and adjusting the watch must be done by someone with good vision. The large clock face and the audible time announcements have been a big help to him. I would recommend this product."

The bottle is small, it only has enough in it for two sessions of fin rot. That could be because I have a 2 gallon tank, and most stores seem to expect people to house their Bettas in three cups of water..."

3934,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,5.0,"We got this the same day we got our two kittens from the shelter. I showed them how to use it and they've been using it since day one. I guess a true testament to the success of this scratching post is my nice big leather couch that i love so much. There are no scratches on it, nor on my leather chairs in the dining room, nor on anything else for that matter. I have this scratching post between dining and living room. I have another on the second floor. Kitties love scratching it and even climbing it. I figure, whatever they are doing to this scratching post, they are not doing to my furniture instead."
3935,Therapy - G For Thinning Or Fine Hair Antioxidant Shampoo,0/0,4.0,havent seen any growth or noticable differences but its does feel a bit healthier. could be in my head though.

3940,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,5.0,We keep this in our shower year round to cut down on the amount of mildew in the shower and on the curtain. I stuck this thing to the wall on the day we got it and its never fallen off. I don't think I've ever said that about another suction cup in my life. The squeegee is a squeegee so it does its job great. No cracking or lack of flexibility. Very happy :)
3941,Fox's U-Bet Vanilla Syrup 20oz - 6 Unit Pack,0/0,4.0,"It has a light sweet taste, and I like that it is clear and not yellow in appearance like the old Nestle quik syrup used to be. My kids like it in their milk, and I was devastated that Nestle stopped producing the vanilla flavoured syrup. Glad to have found a replacement, but have to order it in the US only, as they won't ship to Canada!"
3942,Quick Finder Nail Clipper,0/0,4.0,This item works perfectly. The best part is it's not noisy which is what intimidates my dog. This makes clipping her nails so much easier!
3943,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"The best for the money I've found. Sturdy, feels good in hand. CUTS EVENLY! Really does a superb job. Clean-up a breeze."
3944,Frederic Fekkai Advanced Full Blown Volume Conditioner,0/0,2.0,"I have fine, straight, long, smooth hair, and when I used this product with the Fekkai Full Volume Shampoo, it left my hair feeling clumpy, sticky, and almost brittle. I used it once, and the entire day I felt like my hair was tangled, and when I'd run my hands through it, my hair felt sticky. (And yes, I rinsed well; I have fine hair and make it a point to rinse well every day.) I wouldn't recommend this product to someone with a similar hair type."
3945,Canidae Dry Dog Food for All Life Stages,0/0,5.0,"Ok, I love love this dog food. My goldendoodle pup was having a lot of ear problems and he smelled really bad too. I was just treating the symptoms, dog sprays, ear drops, etc, but I knew there had to be an underlying cause. I was doing some research and came across a lot of pet owners who dogs were having similiar issues and they changed to a higher grade food. I was feeding him Diamond, so it wasnt the bottom of the barrel, but I believe that was the root of our problem. Our vet just kept telling us to keep his ears clean, etc, groom him, but we were doing all of these things. He kind of rode off food allergies, but within days of switching he looks and smells much better, even his eyes stopped running as much!! It sounds aweful but he was hard to be around because he smelled so bad!! Canidea has made our house hold much happier...........and less stinky!"
3946,Nature's Way Choline,0/5,1.0,"It says CAPS on the description, except you get horse pills instead. I didn't even open the bottle, returned it as soon as I realized how big the pills were."

3949,"Bewley's Dublin Morning Tea, 80-Count",0/0,5.0,I have been drinking this bold Irish tea for years and it always satisfies. I like a tea with full flavor and every cup delivers. I keep it in both my kitchen tea caddy and my work cubby. A cup at lunch keeps the mid-afternoon drowsy away.
3950,OSCAR For Women By OSCAR DE LA RENTA Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"I dearly love this fragrance. But, since I cannot get my wife to wear it, I spray a little of it on my pillow at night. Does this make me strange? Hope not, but do hope the manufacturer will make a man's cologne of the same fragrance."
3951,Koosh Ball Classic Koosh Ball Vintage Toy,0/0,1.0,"This item was tiny, absolutely not what I was expecting. I was expecting the dimensions provided, it was about 1/2 that size in reality.Do not recommend to buy."
3952,"Mary Kay TimeWise Targeted-Action Line Reducer,.13 fl. oz.",0/0,1.0,"does not work mary kay products in my opinion are a waste of time and money, they dont work nor live up to standards.i have tried many products and they all have not worked for me.. i have wasted a year on mary kay and nothing.garnier and neutregena has showed me more results and there way less money.. save your money and time."
3953,"Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Apple Cinnamon, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"The company is so stupid they quit making this flavor, it was because they are so dumb they had it listed wrong so the places could not get it so they think it did not sell, it was the only good one they make but the company is such a poor ran outfit you cant tell them anything that they will listen to. I would buy a truck load of these if they would make em again but they wont and if I had won that big power ball I would buy that company out and fire the idiots that work there."
3954,"Old Spice Red Zone Deodorant Body Spray, Aqua Reef - 4 Oz",0/1,5.0,"For some reason, stores sell every old spice spray deodorant except this one it seems. This stuff is cheap, and gets me buttloads of chicks."

3957,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,Pampers are the best diapers and I have used them all. They last all night without any leaks and they fit my son perfectly.
3958,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"After I randomly saw a color I REALLY liked on some girl at the mall, I've been trying to find a similar color for myself and THOUGHT i had found it with Re-Fresh Mint. I looked up images of this color online to be sure, and although it looks like it has a greenish hue on most of the images, IT DOES NOT. If you imagine mixing a light blue color with something to add a SLIGHT HINT of a greyishness to it, then you add a tad of that to just straight up white, this is how I imagine you'd come up with this color. It's very light and has a definite BLUEish hue. I wish it was the green I was looking for, but it's not. And I can't tell if I'm just disappointed that it wasn't the color I was looking for, or if it just doesn't look good on ME, but I added a picture to the review so you can see for yourself. I'm hoping it grows on me..."
3959,Satin Ultra Vivid Fashion Hair Colors Natural Series 3 oz,0/1,5.0,"If you are buying your hair color at the drug store or Sally, STOP!Satin is so gental and really covers the gray. Love the color and it lasts."
3960,Ravensburger Funny Bunny - Children's Game,1/1,4.0,"This is a fun and easy game. Our 3 and 5 year olds really enjoy playing it. It is simple to teach and simple to play, but also entertaining (my kids are tickled anytime a rabbit falls into a hole). Each player starts with 4 bunnies of a color. Players take turns drawing cards which either have you move your bunny 1, 2, or 3 spots or have you turn the carrot in the middle which moves the rabbit hole around the board. The object of the game is to get one of your bunnies to the center of the board without falling into the shifting hole.My only complaint is that I wish it had more cards (you go through the deck quickly, especially if you are playing with 4 people), so we didn't have to shuffle so many times each game."
3961,Graco Silhouette Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer,1/1,5.0,Perfect to start my newborn in! She sleeps in my room with me and a regular bassinet they grow out of so fast! So this bassinet is bigger so she can stay in longer. They changing table being connected is great to! It would of been too much for me to get up in the middle of the night and go to the baby room across the house to change her. Also I have a 2 year old that rooms right next to the baby room so the crying in the middle of the night would wake her up and that would not be good! Vibration and nature sounds are a plus also! Love the design too!
3962,Lazy Pet Poop Patrol Jaw Scoop,0/0,5.0,I like this so much I have been hired by our apartment manager to clean up the poop the lazy apartment dwellers don't. Yes we have some lazy guests even have poop bags free and dog stations but some Lazy People to. So once a week I walk the entire complex and fill a 5 gallon bucket with their laziness. This is my 2nd one.
3963,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,4.0,"'Bought this to replace a lost one. Dog has shoart but thick hair, and it works well.Combs a lot of the under-hair as well as top coat of our &#34;forever shedding&#34; dog."
3964,Papaya Moisturizing Lotion 18 oz.,0/0,5.0,Brought this after reading the reviews. After using this lotion I am very happy with the way it keeps my skin moisturized and I also noticed a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I also love the smell.........
3965,Marineland Penguin Power Filter,0/0,4.0,"I have several other Marineland filters and I love them,I have used other filter systems in the past but Marineland are the best.I have 5 aquariums and have been keeping fist for about 30+ years"
3966,North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,0/0,4.0,I&#8217;m using this gate to keep my dog in the bathroom while I&#8217;m away from the house. The gate requires you to drill into the wall/frame and screw in 4 loops where the gate will attach. I picked this one specifically because my bathroom door is 24&#8221; and there didn&#8217;t seem to be a huge selection of gates that were that narrow. This one fits perfectly. It&#8217;s pretty easy to open and close but you do have to make sure the bottom hook catches the loop which can make it more difficult to open and close with one hand. Not impossible though.If you are using this for dogs and your dog likes to chew you may want to consider a metal one. The gate is wood and I come home to piles of wood shavings where my dog has been chewing on it. Something I didn't even think about him doing!
3967,Educational Insights Magnetic Sight Words and Sentence Builders,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my sister's first grade class to teach sentence components and structure. Durable blocks and easy to handle with small hands. Made of plastic that can be soaked in bleach and water solution to disinfect after handling. Great items. Expect to get long-term usage. Delievery was fast and item was as expected. The container looks larger in the photo than it actually is. Would buy again.
3968,"Kaleidoscope 9""",0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my 4-year old. She doens't have much trouble holding her eye to the opening and seeing the colors. My 2- year old however can't quite figure it out. It's a fun gadget. Not exactly a toy, because I suspect that it would break if played with roughly. Not with like usual play, but if left under a another toy or stuffed animal and stepped on, the shape of it lends itself to snapping in the middle. Not something I would want to clean up. I usually take the glitter wand out of the kaleidoscope area to store it, and it's durable enough to toss in our regular toy box. I just make sure it's flush and flat against the bottom so there's no downward pressure on the middle of the tube. This will last for quite a while unless something traumatic happens."
3969,D-Mannose,0/1,5.0,"Had UTI once or twice a month for 4 years. Visited many doctors and they all wanted antibiotic (which I did for the first year). After no effect on the UTI, only damage on my stomach, I decided it was enough. Took me 3 years to find d-manosse but the wait was worth it. Before I go to bed, take 1 teaspoon and sleep with this healing water. No more UTI ever."
3970,Avon GLIMMERSTICKS Eye Liner,0/0,5.0,Avon Glimmersticks have always been a favorite of mine. Its not too soft or too hard and glides on the eyes smoothly. Looks great for hours.
3971,Log Splitter,0/0,3.0,"good detail toy, limited in its play time but the kids enjoyeddidnt have the truck to attached it too.but still a good stand alone toy"
3972,"L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Waterproof Mascara, 0.28-Fluid Ounce",0/0,4.0,"I have short and fine lashes. It's hard to curl them or make them even noticeable, but this mascara has been working for me"
3973,Dohm-SS Single Speed Sound Conditioner by Marpac (formerly known as the Sleepmate/Sound Screen 580A),0/0,5.0,my teenage son grew up falling asleep to white noise - this is perfect - he doesn't have to sleep with a box fan on in his room when it's winter....
3974,Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,0/0,5.0,This was the best thing I've gotten for my daughter. It is wonderful for those night time diaper changes. Easy to clean and holds a whole pack of wipes.
3975,Jenga - 2006 Edition,0/0,5.0,"I love this game. In my country it costs about $80 local currency, so getting one online for a fraction of the price was awesome. It is a really fun, family game. Although it's just as much fun playing with only two players. The tiles are not fancy like other versions of the game, but that doesn't take away from the fun or value of the game. The travel box it came in still looks brand new a year later, and so does the piece of card used to help stack the blocks. (N.B. despite other reviews, we have had no difficulty setting up the game using said card.) All the tiles still look brand new. Note though, that we only ever time to play the game about once or twice a month. It is a great buy!"
3976,The Body Shop Body Butter,2/3,1.0,"I was very disapointed in the smell of love body butter, it smells like motor oil. and not like the product scent was discribed to be.I would not recommend this scent to any one."
3977,"KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Toy",0/0,5.0,The dogs love the massage this grooming brush while gettingbathed with the I Love Pet Head Shampoo. Both productswere purchased at the same time.
3978,Melissa & Doug Magnetic Chalk Dry Erase Board,0/0,5.0,my 14 m boy love to draw and wright this was a great purchase he love itand i have more time for my self :)makes him busy
3979,Ginger Root By Nature's Way 550 Mg,1/1,3.0,"These are cheap and seem to work as well as any other ginger product I have used (which is not much) but the pills are hard to swallow for me. I never have problems swallowing any pills but these are different. It's not the size of the pill its the coating. As soon as these get wet in your mouth the gel capsule becomes very tacky and can easily get stuck in your throat. I have learned that as long as I take three of four big gulps of water as soon as I take them it doesn't happen. But if I just treat these like a regular pill and take with a small sip of water, they get stuck nearly every time. I'm not saying they will choke you but you will know they're stuck when you burp ginger until the pills finishes dissolving. It's more irritating than anything but easily preventable using lots of water."
3980,PetSafe ScatMat Dog Training Strip Extension,0/0,1.0,"I know many people really like the scat mat, but after paying $80+ for this and one of the base mats, it didn't even work. My cats couldn't even feel the low and medium settings. They did not like the high setting, but it didn't stop them from crossing over it. Even then, they would just take a long running leap across the base mat to get into the room I was trying to block off. Waste of money for me."
3981,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,4.0,I bought these diapers mainly because of the price and the quantity. I like them but found they leak often. I prefer Luvs.
3982,Sunblock Stick 30 + No Fragrance - 0.50 oz - Stick,0/0,5.0,This sunscreen stick was awesome. I used it only for their face and I picked this brand because both of my girls have very sensitive skin. It worked great and I would definitely buy again.

3984,No Scream Cream Relax and Wax,0/0,5.0,This product definitely lessened the pain and there was MUCH less irritation afterwards. I will continue to use this product!
3985,AMARIGE For Women By GIVENCHY Eau De Toilette Spray,0/1,2.0,The perfume is awesome but I wanted this bottle for traveling and the top doesn't close tightly. I will use it up but only at home.

3988,"Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,I put this stuff in my protein shakes to add some texture and fiber; it's a great deal if you use a lot of flax meal; even better since the stuff is organic.
3989,Maxim Deluxe TreeHouse with Accessories in Natural,0/0,4.0,Will be giving this to my grandkids. I put it togetter and instructions were very god. Can't wait to give it to them.
3990,Kriegar Sharp Stainless Steel Straight Razors,0/0,4.0,"All of the Kreigar blades seem to be solid stainless. Take a lot of effort to get honed to the right edge for shaving, but could very well be worth it afterwards. Handle is a little on the heavy side for a straight razor, but makes you take your time with shaving to hold it correctly. Overall they are OK for their low price."
3991,Knights,0/0,5.0,Item was a good product. The colors and details are good. It is a nice piece to have it in my collection.
3992,"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,4.0,"As you might imagine, these batteries work as designed. I have had a chance to use them in a powered toothbrush and a battery operated train we are using as a part of our Christmas decorations. Its great knowing that I won't have to swap these batteries out on a regular basis. Would they really keep for seven years ? Can't say, as I tend to use batteries shortly after being purchased. That said, they worked out of the package and that's good enough for me !"
3993,Solitaire Hand Held Electronic Arcade Game,0/0,3.0,"game is very slow to respond. some buttons stick. scoring is off at times. with me, it serves its purpose."

3995,Reflux-Away by Natural Care - 60 Capsules,0/0,2.0,i am very much into natural remidies but this product did not meet my needs or expections. however one can always try.
3996,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,0/0,2.0,"I see all these good reviews but maybe I'm doing something wrong. First time it cleaned on it's own, it scared my cat. It scared her enough that she didn't use the litter box for a few days. So I have to unplug it and when I see her go, I'll take her out of the room and then let it clean. The crystals DO NOT absorb the poop or urine. The poop gets stuck in the rails.I don't really like it. :("
3997,Bruder Toys Man Garbage Truck Rear Loading Green,0/0,5.0,"My six year old loves Bruder trucks and this is no exception. Very realistic. Bigger than I expected, it's huge."

3999,"Revlon Super Lustrous Pearl Lipstick, 0.15 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Five star because it continues to compliments my complexion, leaves my often chapped lips soft and moisturized. Hope Revlon doesn't stop making it."
4000,Goat Milk Powder 12 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"Never tried powdered goat's milk before, but this was good. Loved the taste. Meets my requirement for higher protein.Also, in the last 10 years, since turning 40, I became lactose intolerant. However, this milk gives me no problems. I can enjoy muesli for breakfast again.Another satisfied customer."
4001,Yeowww Pollock Fish Catnip Toy,0/0,4.0,This toy didn't really do anything for my cat. However my cat is one of those cats that doesn't even care about lazer pointers.
4002,"Now Foods, Amino Complete",1/1,5.0,I saw information about these amino acids on a show and wanted to try them out. My energy levels have increased after starting them.
4003,Source Naturals L-Glutamine 500mg,0/0,5.0,"After I bust it out at the gym, its time for recovery, maybe its a placebo effect, but makes me happy!"
4004,Sparkleworks - Dress-up Eveningwear,0/0,3.0,Our child did not get especially enthusiastic with this plastic toy/ Maybe she'll like it better as she gets older.
4005,Clairol Beautiful Collection Semi-Permanent Hair Color,1/1,3.0,The color seemed to show more after I washed it a couple of times. Didnt really come out as strong as I thought it would. You had to see me really catch the sunlight from the side(lol) before you would see the tint in my hair. Perhaps I overwashed right after the application before drying my hair the first time. Not really sure. So overall it was ok but dont think I will try again or at least not the same color.
4006,"Priva Premium Hospital Bed in a Bag, White",0/0,5.0,"Very practical product for a home hospital bed. The lightweight white blanket can be bleached, which is a nice feature for this particular use. I also liked that the top sheet has a fitted pocket bottom to help hold it in place."
4007,Webkinz Pug,0/0,5.0,"My daughter used to get webkinz every time we went to the store, now that they are 8 and 11 they only require 1 or 2 new webkinz each year. My 11 year old chose this one a year ago and he's still around. He looks exactly like the picture and he's super cute on the screen. &#34;Hug a Pug&#34; has been their favorite webkinz song since they began playing over 5 years ago. They are very excited to have a Pug to Hug!!!"
4008,"Baking Ammonia (Ammonium Carbonate), Bulk, 2 oz",0/0,5.0,"I couldn't fine Ammonium Carbonate anywhere, so I ordered this product from Amazon. It was a bit slow to arrive, but no complaints for something so hard to find. The product is straight Ammonia, so if your expecting low-odor because it's a powder you will be disappointed. Working with this at all will fill your work area with light Ammonia fumes. Other than that, if your ordering this, you should know what your doing. I used it to make smelling salts, and although it does tend to clump, it works very well."
4009,TY Classic Plush - BLUEBEARY the Bear,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas and when I opened the package I was so happy with what I saw. Very adorable and cute and great quality. Will make the perfect stocking stuffer.A perfect gift for a little girl, she will love it!"
4010,Bottled Aspirin 1000/bottle,2/5,1.0,"I was disappointed when this bottle arrived to find that the active ingredients are NSAID, commonly available, rather than ""old fashioned"" aspirin, acetysaliicylic acid."
4011,Coralife 05146 SL-65 Super Luft Air Pump,0/0,5.0,"I thought this would be a crappy cheap purchase but my experience with the unit has been great. It's effin loud, no doubt, but for what it does, it's actually relatively quiet. This thing pounds out air like nobodies business. I've had this thing plugged in and running for a year straight. It gets a little warm so if you have a small fan to point at the compressor while running, it will significantly reduce the heat signature coming from the unit. This will also help the unit last longer and run better as hot operating temperature adds wear and tear to anything."
4012,The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup,0/0,4.0,no leaks! These cups were a little difficult for my 3 year old to drink from - he felt like he needed to suck too hard to get the water out. But it was perfect to keep the two year old from spilling

4016,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,4.0,"This clipper set is great for the price. It does the job and comes with a standard set of guards. I used these clippers at Burning Man to cut hair in the desert, and they held up very well even in dry, dusty conditions, so they will probably last a long time in your home. Given the price, no complaints whatsoever. They probably are louder and heavier than more expensive models, but if you just want to shave your head then this is a great option."
4017,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,4.0,"These pet nail clippers are very good quality and heavy duty. The easy, non-slip grip works well. I would recommend these."
4018,Rainbow Light Women's One Multivitamin,0/0,4.0,I have tried many other name brand multi-vitamins. This one is the only one that I am able to tolerate.

4020,Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer,0/0,5.0,My hair has come out fantastic every time with this. The attachments are great. The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...but it works. Love it and highly recommend.
4021,Ergobeads Hand Exerciser - Stress Ball - Blue,0/0,5.0,Nice and easy to work with. Does as suppossed to not to much say about it really other than does as is designed to do
4022,Deborah Lippmann Nail Lacquer,0/0,5.0,Deborah Lippmann nail lacquer is a good product. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. This color is a black background with red glitter. It's pretty cool.
4023,Battat Take Apart 4X4,0/0,5.0,Pieces are perfect size for little hands. The toy can really only be assembled one way so it provides a bit of structure. As opposed to giving a child a bucket full of Legos. This is a great toy for growing young minds.
4024,"Vet's Best Hot Spot Spray, 16-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I also bought sulfodene for my six year old Doberman and it worked great but this stuff is better for a couple reasons. First, it sprays on instead of having to apply it by hand.Second, it clears up hot spots within a day or two.The only draw back is that it smells a little weird. But I think it is meant to keep the dog from licking it off."
4025,Skwish Color Burst (Boxed),0/0,4.0,Got for 13 mo. old son for a 10 hr flight all together and he loves this toy. highly recommend!
4026,Source Naturals N-A-G 500mg,2/2,5.0,"I have been taking NAG for 20 years to reduce pain from vulvodynia. It makes connective tissue more resiliant and I would be in a great deal of pain without it. I take 12 capsules a day and have no ill effects. Along with a low oxalate diet and calcium citrate, it has given me my life back."
4027,Lip Formula - .35 oz.,0/0,5.0,"Found this on a trip to Hawaii, but trying to find it locally was difficult.t seems less like a petroleum product than, say Carmex does. I also like the Aloe.I keep a tube in my pocket all the time."

4029,"NCB Alaska Deep Sea Fish Oil, Omega 3 1000mg 300 Softgels",0/0,3.0,"There's frequent mention of fishy burps- which I don't get. I do, however, notice that I get heartburn after taking these on an empty stomach. I would have to do some better controlled experiments to be sure, but for now I think I'll go back to the Costco brand."
4030,Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles tube Case of 48,0/0,5.0,"I am addicted to these things, and being on a diet I miss them terribly. Amazon has an amazing array of British candies that cost a fortune locally but are very reasonably priced. They make great gifts, and they do not spoil on the shelf. Who could ask for anything more?"
4031,Ideal Pet Original Pet Door,0/0,5.0,First the disclaimer
4032,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,4.0,I love everything about this...The fact that before they are standing up you can pull that front off and put on the floor for them to play and then put it back on for when they are starting to stand/walk....Big downfall if they aren't ready to walk yet and are a little tipsy don't let them use it does wobble with your kids.
4033,"Contoured Foam Ring Pillow - 18"" White",1/1,4.0,"I ordered this cushion to sit on while doing post-surgery exercises and when sitting at mu computer. Having only used it a few days I would offer the following:To begin, this is actually a 3 1/2 star rating but I can't enter that.First, like ANY seat cushion it takes some getting used to. That is, when you're used to sitting on a flat, square surface, now sitting on an oval ring feels different. For me, I started by placing the pillow so the center hole was horizontal on the chair(s) but found that not very comfortable for my situation because only a small area was provided relief. I switched it to a vertical position and it is working much better; it allows better relief. from the sacrum and perineum forward.Second, (and this is why I have only given a 3 1/2-star rating), the material in this cushion DOES compress. I am a male, 5-11, 182 lbs. and the pillow compresses around half it's height. In my case that still leaves enough opening in the center to give relief, but I have my reservations as to how long before it begins to remain depressed.Overall, I recommend this cushion unless you weight over 185 lbs. Also, I would recommend you give it a chance to decompress by not sitting on it for hours on end. If you give it a rest every 30-45 minutes, (just stand up and stretch your legs) I think it will last longer.Oh, and as after thought, periodically reverse the front to the back on the chair and vice-versa."
4034,Wahl 79450 ComboPro 14-Piece Complete Styling Kit,0/0,5.0,"I had a Conair and I had to keep tuning it to quiet if back down, so haircuts took a long time.Now I zipped through our six boys and a Dad. I can even talk while cutting! I hope it'll last.I'll check back in with a year."
4035,"Swiffer WetJet Spray, Mop Floor Cleaner Starter Kit (Packaging May Vary)",0/0,5.0,She has used this product almost on a daily basis. She has figure out a work around to filling up the solution containers. But they are pretty inexpensive to buy on here and the pads on here too. It is just shopping for the best deal online and this one is a winner. A++
4036,Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser,0/0,5.0,We use this for our 3 dogs a 7month old German Shephard a 13 year old Golden Retriever and a 2 year old Bichon/Pom mix. It has made our dogs coats shine and feel so soft. Our German Shephard doesn't scratch as much. I would recommend this for all of you dogs.
4037,"Perugina Panettone, 1.1 Lbs",0/0,5.0,I always look for this Perugina brand of panettone and buy enough to last me several months as well as to give as gifts. I inadvertently ordered this 1.1 lb size and was disappointed at first but went on to use it for gifts to elderly friends and singles who did not need a larger size bread and got rave reviews from them. The freshness and taste is exactly what I expected and the seller did a terrific job of packing and shipping it but my next order will be for the 2.2lb size.
4038,"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Case of 6)",0/0,4.0,"I enjoy using Mrs. Meyer's products, but I especially like anything with the gardenia scent, so it was a treat to find the hand soap in that scent. The soap is gentle on the hands and leaves a pleasant odor after washing, both on the hands and in the air in the restroom."
4039,Culturelle Culturelle Probiotic,0/0,5.0,"I have a million allergies and I never know which one will cause an intestinal problem. I'm really cautious about what I eat, but sometimes I make mistakes. These pills really help my digestive tract stay healthy!"

4041,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,Have used this product for years. Best of the sound machines on the market.. We recently replaced one that was in use for over twenty years. Creates pleasant white background noise that aids sleep. A must for day sleepers to drown out house activity noises. Husband takes it along when traveling.
4042,"LEGO Green Building Plate (10"" x 10"")",2/2,3.0,"Bought four of these, and the kids love it. Perfect for them to build houses, buildings, etc on them. And less for us to clean up :)"
4043,Liquid Silk Liquid Silk,0/0,5.0,I love liquid silk lubricant but I wish they made it in bigger size! Does not get sticky- it's milky in color & the consistency is almost like a slippery lotion.

4046,Midwest Select Triple-Door Dog Crate,0/0,4.0,"Folds down for storage, well made, not as easy to fold as other people say in my opinion, lightweight. Still wont fit in our car till we have a bigger car."
4047,"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",0/0,5.0,"I am very small myself, and this was the only nursing pillow I tried that felt like it actually got my son into the right position and didn't feel like I was having to hold it on. Everyone is different, but this is the one that worked best for me."
4048,OPI Dulce De Leche,0/0,5.0,"The product was great and shipping was speedy. I have been eying this color for a while and finally decided to try it. I love nudes especially in a professional setting, but this one really didn't stand out like the others in the OPI brand. The consistency was great and smooth but for me the actual color did nothing for my mocha skin tone. Still love OPI though :)"
4049,Melissa & Doug Penguin Plush,0/0,5.0,"This is an amazing product for the price. It is huge, beautifully made and so soft. It is so much nicer than I expected. I was a little worried about buying something like this online, but I am so pleased. Would recommend it to all penquin lovers!"
4050,FHI Heat Platform 1 Inch Professional Ceramic Tourmaline Styling Iron with Nano-Fuzeion Technology,0/0,5.0,I don't normally do reviews on products but had to do a review on this one!! I am extremely happy with the service provided by Discount Jungle and how they stand by their products! I would def'n purchase another item from this company!! As way of product....it is a great product and I love the way it makes my hair shiny and straight!! Love it!! Thank you Discount Jungle!!
4051,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,0/0,1.0,This is a horrible company!! This product does not cost $14.88. All you get for this price is a large fabric bag. You have to contact the company for the butterflies (caterpillers) and when you do they tell you it is going to cost another $5. That brings the price up to $20 not what is advertised.
4052,JJ Cole Essentials Blanket,0/0,4.0,"I use this for picnics, and it's terrific. The dirt and grass brushes right off, and it folds into a compact carrying case. I would recommend it to anyone."
4053,Light Mountain Color The Gray,0/0,5.0,This does cover gray (leaves it copper colored) and the resulting color does not wash out in a week or so the way a one step henna does. I do agree with the reviewer who commented that it is a really messy process though.
4054,Nature's Answer Horsetail,4/4,5.0,"I ordered this product to assist with my hair growth as I have done a lot of things i.e. steam treatments, and nothing seems to work. I can say that my hair texture has gotten better and that my edges are growing back in."
4055,"Kleen Free Naturally, Natural, Non-Toxic, Enzyme Solution and Multi-Purpose Cleaner",0/0,5.0,"I had a mite problem in the house and ordered every kind of products to battle the pest. None seem to have worked except this spray. It kills insects, mites, ants, whatever, on direct spray. They say it is non toxic so that is a plus, but you might have to do you own. But other than that, I do recommend this stuff if you are having an ant or mite problem."
4056,Soft Focus All-Over Face Color,0/0,5.0,I don't wear foundation because I can't stand it but I do love this. While it isn't a foundation it does leave my skin tone looking even with just a slight glow (or radiance) to it. I use this everyday and have for the past few years now. It is my go to make up. Just love it!
4057,Maxim Enterprise Inc. Mountain Set Accessory,0/0,3.0,"We got this for our son realizing that it only came with a few pieces but I guess after getting it and thinking about it, realized it wasn't worth as much as we paid. Although it's a nice toy, its a little pricey for what you get."
4058,Happi Tummi Natural Colic Relief Waistband,0/0,5.0,"My three month old is having some tummy aches after eating. He would burp well, but still have the tummy aches. I tried gas drops but they didn't seem to help. I tried the Happi Tummi and it has been the only thing that helps him. Within minutes of putting it on he clams down and is much happier. Love this product!"
4059,Adagio Marketing ShowerTek WV2 The Original Fog Free Shower Mirror,0/0,5.0,I bought this about 5 years ago. I still have it and it still works great. That guy complaining about the leaky valves must have 100 pounds of water pressure. If you have the normal 50 or 60 pounds of pressure this will work great for you. Priced right too.
4060,Colorforms Activity Toys Original 60th Anniversary Edition,0/0,5.0,"Exactly what we were looking for - the children love them! Not everything has to run on batteries, sing, dance and flash."
4061,Source Naturals L-Glutamine 500mg,0/0,2.0,"Honestly I don't know how to rate these. I am rating it relative to what good I expect them to be to the typical buyer... which is little, if any. I doubt these will harm you in any way, and they are certainly not unreasonably priced.In the summer I was trying to seriously improve my physical conditioning with regular workouts focused on building up muscle mass. I thought I'd try these to help in body recovery from those.I can't say objectively that they made any difference whatsoever. I can find no scientific support to show that this supplement contributes notably to any situation. All the ""data"" is testimonial.. which is pretty useless.As winter has set in, I have become far less motivated and have let my condition deteriorate... well at least I no longer have sore muscles from conditioning exercise.I think ONLY if you're on a SERIOUS conditioning program that leaves you with notable muscle soreness of the ""good kind"" (the kind you get when you know you're stressing and rebuilding muscle.. not injuries), then you might use these to the extent you think it helps.However, if you're in any other situation... ""normal life"" or only doing maintenance exercises.. you're probably wasting your money."
4062,Safari Flea Comb with a Double Row of Teeth,0/1,3.0,"The flea comb works like it should, except with the double rows of teeth it's harder to get the comb through my cats fur. I have one fluffy cat and one slick cat and it's impossible to use on the short hair cat because I can't get the comb to lift up his fur. It works okay on the fluffy one.I don't see any benefit to having a double row of teeth."
4063,Natrol Tonalin CLA 1200mg,0/0,4.0,This is one of those products you have to wait for the end results. I purchased it after hearing about it from a Clinical Nutritionist.

4070,You & Me,0/0,5.0,"Our granddaughter just had a baby brother and before he arrived, for her birthday, we bought her a whole setup-Corolle doll, crib, doll clothing and accessories bag. The assessory bag was great, containing everything a very young &#34;mama&#34; would need for her &#34;baby.&#34; she uses the accessories to &#34;feed&#34; her baby, diaper her and put cream on her. Lovely compliment to any doll purchase. The vendor was very prompt with delivery, too."
4071,Contech StayAway Motion-Activated Pet Deterrent,2/2,5.0,"It is a very sensitive motion detector, so it takes some time to figure out just how to place it so that it only goes off when your cat jumps up where they shouldn't. At first it went off more because of my husband walking by it. A few adjustments with the placement and it works great! After the cat jumped up on the cabinet twice, he learned his lesson. He looks up, sees the can and moves on. He doesn't even try to get on the cabinet anymore. I just moved the can to the one counter in the kitchen he likes to get on and it went off this morning and as soon as he jumped onto the counter, he saw the can and jumped down. He didn't even wait for it to go off. Now I just have to see if he has figured out that it was moved from the cabinet. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to keep their cat off of or out of certain places. It is expensive, but it really works."

4078,Aquarium Divider System in Black,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for a 55 gallon tank, I didn't use it for fish though, I used it for tarantulas and scorpions. It works great keeping them apart, and they allow the fog to go into all the separated cages"
4079,Bergan Stack-n-Stor 100 Food Storage and Dispenser (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,Looked at a bunch of food containers at local Pet Stores.All were decent.But I like these because they are big enough to hold a lot of food and seem very sturdy even when stacked.Love my set.I would buy them all over again - and these prices at Amazon are fantastic
4080,LUTECE For Women By DANA Eau de Toilette Spray,2/2,1.0,"My understanding is that this fragrance is no longer manufactured. This is not what I thought to be the last bottle in town lucky find. What's inside the bottle is bogus. It doesn't even smell like the original fragrance gone stale. Stay away and save your money. The company I bought from said to return it (at my expense, of course). I am not spending another dime on that rip off. I do not waste money but I tossed it into the trash and took the loss. That mystery stuff could be toxic."
4081,O'Keefes Creme,0/0,3.0,"This stuff really does work to help heal cracked and chapped working hands. It left a weird residue feeling that I didn't like, but if the texture doesn't bother you then you'll love this stuff."

4083,Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier,0/0,5.0,"Great fit for my 9 lbs cat! Plenty of room for kitty to move around, fit underneath the airplane seat with no problem. The shearling liner adds extra comfort and is easily removed for cleaning! Can't beat the price at any of the pet stores."
4084,"MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment, Psoriasis Treatment, Intensive Strength, 3.8 oz.",0/0,4.0,"I've had Psoriasis since I was a kid. I'm now nearing 30 and I've yet to find something that helps- until now. Short of using prescription shampoos and creams, this is the best stuff I've tried OTC. After just a few applications, I noticed a difference in the areas that have been bugging me on my scalp.There IS some odor (think T-Gel), but it's not strong and it does wash off your hands with one wash. The cream can be a little greasy but does absorb into the scalp quite well- You won't immediately need to wash this out a few hours after application.I have moderate-severe scalp Psoriasis, as well as atopic Excema and some other skin issues, and I must say this is by far the best OTC product I've come across so far. Would be 5 stars if not for the slight odor and mild greasyness."
4085,Scott's Cakes Almond Macaroon Cookies Boxed,0/0,1.0,"I ordered 60 undecorated Christmas cookies for a children's decorating party. Scott sent me two emails assuring me that the product would be delivered on the 19th, no worries. Freshness, no worries. I received the cookies today, a week early, 12 of the 60 were broken, and all 60 cookies were bundled in saran wrap, and two of those bundles were open where the saran wrap had come apart. Stale cookies, broken, and a week early. All this for $92. What a foolish decision on my part to believe Scott and his ""assurances"". I would NEVER recommend Scott's company or their products. Terrible!"
4086,Beads & Pattern Cards Set; 108 Beads-Assorted Colors/Sizes; no. LER0139,1/1,5.0,I got these for my son who just turned three. He enjoys beading the string and I was really happy to see the plastic tips are longer than the bead is wide. This made it very easy for him to grab the ends as he passed it through. In the past we have not been so lucky. We are working on beading according to pattern but I know that is a skill he will master in time.
4087,"Petrodex Enzymatic Toothpaste Dog Poultry Flavor, 6.2-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I chose this product because of the rave reviews here on Amazon. My dog is a 7 year old Pomeranian with the worst breath I've ever smelled. I've tried all the toothpastes at the pet store except enzymatic ones. This is the first enzymatic toothpaste I've tried, but after 2 days of using it, his breath cleared up completely. Its a pleasure to be near him when he yawns now. I don't see any reversal in tartar buildup, but nothing can get rid of that aside from a real dental cleaning (I would know since I'm a dentist). However, the toothpaste does a good job in minimizing future buildup.The hugest difference to me is the complete change in his breath. I give it 5 stars for that since nothing has solved that problem for us in 7 years."
4088,Perfect Pet Tubby Kat Cat Door with 4 Way Lock And LEXAN Flap,1/1,4.0,"Well built and looks good on the door. (And mine is a hollow core door which this is perfect for.) Best to take door off to install. The screws used to apply it to the door were so hard to turn in I would not have been able to tighten them with the door still hanging. ( I am a strong 6'2&#34; able bodied male). I am not joking.... they were nearly impossible to finish tightening!Other than that, this product is a winner.... although it has taken nearly a month for my 'scaredy' cat to use it!"
4089,FIRST For Women By VAN CLEEF & ARPELS Eau de Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,"I won't wear anything else but First, I feel like it's me and no one else. Looks pretty on my dresser too"
4090,Camille Beckman Glycerine Hand Therapy,0/0,5.0,"Have used this product for years, Rate it a 5 for purchase through Amazon, because order was filled promptly , arrived without any damage, and it's not easy to find the 32 oz. Rose glycerin refill!"
4091,Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food,0/0,4.0,"I have a Boston terrier and two English bulldogs that I switched to this food six months ago. They have done well on the food, their coats look really good. They also seem to really like the taste of the food. I was hoping the food would help with more with some of their gas issues, but that is a problem of the breeds."
4092,Angel By Thierry Mugler For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray Refillable 3.4 oz,3/3,5.0,"A lovely scent that is soft, angelic, and somewhat mysterious. It lasts a long time, and I can usually still smell it faintly the next day. My husband, who rarely comments on perfume, loved this one on me. If you are buying the large 3.4 ounce refillable bottle, it comes in a lovely tall bottle called Rising Star. If you want the star-shaped bottle, (Shooting Star), go with the smaller 1.7 ounce bottle. Whatever bottle you choose, this perfume is beautiful!"
4093,Lorna Doone Cookies,0/0,2.0,"I used to LOVE Lorna Doones. I stopped liking them when they eliminated butter. That was decades ago, but I was old enough to notice the change. Many manufacturers stopped using butter (I think Mrs. Butterworth had real butter in it once). Lorna Doones now don't come close in my opinion to their more excellent taste when they used shortning AND butter. If you ever have shortbread made with pure butter, it will spoil you for Lorna Doones inferior taste."
4094,Country Life Maxi Hair TR,0/0,3.0,"used this for several months, but it just didn't have the minerals I need so I had to supplement it with another vitamin, after a while I just stopped taking this one."
4095,F.A.S.T. Nisim FAST Shampoo & Conditioner 12 oz. each For FAST Hair Growth!,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this product to give it a try, even there's a lot of bad reviews on the website. I didn't care because I know some people will exaggerate on the bad reviews. All products will works depends on the health conditions, food and other stuff. All I can say I tried for 1 months and I couldn't use it anymore. Hair loss was too much, price was little expensive... The only reason Im giving 2 stars it was because the CLEAN smell, no more than that, but like I said it didn't work for me, maybe, other people will said IT WORKS."
4096,Cashmere Mist By Donna Karan For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,1/1,2.0,"I have used Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan for a while now. However, this was my first time purchasing online because of the awesome price. Since, I have never ordered perfumes before I totally missed that the item is non-returnable. Now, I am stuck with it and don't like it! :("
4097,POOF-Slinky 225R Collector's Edition Original Slinky Dog in Retro Packaging,0/0,5.0,"After watching Toy Story with my parents, my son couldn't wait for the release of Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. He received several characters from the movie as gifts, but Slinky Dog was hard to find. Thanks to Amazon.com, we were able to find it and add another toy to his collection."
4098,3-pair Pack of PUTTY BUDDIES Floating Formula Soft Silicone Ear Plugs for Swimming/ Bathing,2/2,5.0,These earplugs are some of the best on the market. They stay put a lot better than over the counter pharmacy kind.
4099,Blood Pressure Tea 20 Bags,0/0,5.0,I use this mixed with regular rooibos tea and make iced tea so he will drink it and it really works to regulate his blood pressure with his meds...love it
4100,Lounger Orthopedic Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"I ordered 2 for 2 stubborn dogs. After a day or 2 of training, they come straight in and get in their beds and curl up comfortably. No more fighting to get their spot in the living room. They each go to their own bed and know which bed belongs to who. A little pricey, but very durable and comfortable."
4101,Midwest Gold- Zinc Indoor/Outdoor Exercise Pet Pen,0/0,5.0,"I had one of these pens for about four years, and it held up very well. I never noticed any rust or anything on it. I keep it inside, but have had other pens and crates that got rusty. I recently had to buy a new pen. Since I needed it immediately, I bought one from a pet store. It was double the price, and not nearly as sturdy.Lesson learned. I bought another one of these Gold-Zinc pens and use the pet shop one as a spare. My rabbit tries to bite and scratch at the pen, but the finish has remained nice.(A small note - I don't think the 24&#34; height is tall enough for most rabbits, but mine has a bad leg so she can't jump that high)."

4103,Take-A-Part Vehicle Building Toy Set,0/0,5.0,"My grandson -age 2, loves screwdrivers and helping Daddy and Grandpa. This toy was a nice challenge and allows him to safely play with a screwdriver and build his own toy."
4104,Sudoku Electronic Game,0/0,3.0,I had one of these for years. I really liked it and spent more time with it than I should have. I purchased another online that did not work. Tried another through Amazon. It works but still has problems. They just don't make things like they used to.
4105,Webkinz Bulldog,0/0,4.0,"These bulldogs are perfect for our school because our mascot is a bulldog. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star is that their eyes are a bit covered by their heavy eyelids. I know that is the bulldog way, but the eyes are so cute in the picture, but a bit hard to see in &#34;real life.&#34; I am extremely happy with the set I bought to give to teachers as incentives, and I would purchase them again in a heartbeat."
4106,The Art of Shaving The 4 Elements of the Perfect Shave Starter Kit,2/2,5.0,"I was first introduced to this when friend gave me a sample size from Sephora and I was hooked. The system really works, it leaves you feeling smooth for a large part of the day and smells great, I bought the Sandalwood scent one. As for the sizes they last a really long time since you are really only using a little bit at a time. I was also able to get it for $80 at a different site due an ongoing promotion (check astonishing skin care). I have no complaints at all for this product and it would be an amazing gift if someone was giving it to me for Christmas."
4107,Baby Buddy Baby's 1st Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,I bought this product for my 10 month old daughter. I could easily leave her chewing on it unattended because it is not small so I knew there was no chocking risk. She really loves it!
4108,Oster 78005-010 A5 Single-Speed Clippers Made In USA,0/0,5.0,"My two shitzus must be cross bread with some sort of wooky-like creature. I have never seen a thicker coat on any dog or bigger knots, which are impossible to remove with $30 clippers from petco. I finally spent the extra money and it was 100% worth it! These clippers cut right through the under coat and knots with ease, I was very impressed. They get a little warm but the cooling lube takes care of that. What was a hour job is now cut down to 20 minutes, these clippers are defiantly worth the cash."
4109,Melissa & Doug See & Spell,0/0,5.0,"My son uses these letter pieces at his preschool (Montessori) and he loves to do the same &#34;work&#34; at home. The different words are easy to figure out, and it is self correcting because the wrong letter won't fit in the cutout. Fun to play with the letters on their own too to spell out your child's name or other words."
4110,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"While my wife had traditional assumed liter box duties, after moving into a smaller home it was hard to argue that the only reasonable place for the litter box wasn't a closet a few feet from my computer chair, a place where I spend a considerable amount of my retirement day. (Fortunately, a generally stuffed nose makes this bearable.) Every morning with coffee I bring up a fixed set of webpages for perusing, with one of the pages being one that I created on my hard drive that shows a cartoon cat with the admonishment ""Please clean my litter box"". When I reach it in my daily progression I seldom hesitate to comply because it requires so little effort; I simply pivot in my chair, swing the closet door further open, bend down and roll the box over and back as proscribed. At that point I must admit that I have to leave my chair to deposit my findings in the toilet across the hall (I swear by World's Best Cat Litter).I have been using this box for over a year, and have absolutely no complaints. It takes a while to perfect the rolling technique (slow and extreme), and how to keep the box properly topped up (little or no extra litter in the tray indicates that it's time to add some). It does take a lot of space to perform the roll, but if you've got it this box is a winner! (OK, you can do some sliding if space is tight.)"
4111,Melissa & Doug Large Shapes Jumbo Puzzle,1/1,5.0,this is a great puzzle! my one yr old loves it and knows how to put all the shapes in by himself! i really love this puzzle and recommend it for all kids!!
4112,Paul Sebastian PS Fine Cologne for Men 8.0 oz Fine Cologne Pour,0/0,5.0,I was so happy to receive my cologne order so quickly in with such great packaging. So pleased with this ordering experience and it makes my Christmas shopping easier!
4113,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,5.0,This is a great product for the price. It is very stable and well made and best of all the cat loves using it. She goes to it after waking up and other times during the day and also climbs it for entertainment and play. The material seems to be exactly what she likes to sink her claws into.
4114,Natural Calm Natural Vitality,1/1,5.0,"I have always had trouble sleeping and refuse to take sleeping pills. My healthcare provider suggested I try this. It really does work. The first night I took it, I slept well and even fell back asleep when I woke up to use the restroom. Even through a snoring spouse. An added bonus is that I stopped getting leg cramps from running. My husband has restless leg, especially after running 4 miles so he tried it and has not had any issues since. We take a teaspoon every night now. It is a little tangy, but it is not a bad flavor; kind of like a sour lemonade candy."
4115,Escape by Calvin Klein for Women,1/1,3.0,"Unfortunately, the smell is not nearly as wonderful as the sample I had tried. Perhaps the contents of the one I purchased is old."
4116,Gu GU Energy Gel- 24 Pack,0/0,5.0,I'm a runner and Gu is an essential to my long runs. It also helps on those sluggish mornings when I just need a pick me up

4118,Omega 13109 Creamy Curved Handle Pure Badger Shaving Brush,1/1,4.0,"I previously had a brush that would lose bristles every time I shaved which was quite annoying, this brush is very soft and has not shed one bristle in the 8 months I have had it. Note"
4119,Now Foods Vitamin A 25000 IU,1/1,3.0,I didn't see any effect on my skin I have a horrible acne and I saw in the internet to drink some Vitamins A and E for my skin but I dink this thing every day with Vitamin E and C but I didn't see any result. If you guys want your acne to be gone you guys should take a Phantotenic acid (Vitamins B5) because that is the only product in world made my acne gone.
4120,"Ivory Liquid Clear Hand Soap, 7.5 oz",0/0,5.0,This is the only soap I have used for years to wash my hands prior to putting my contact lenses in.
4121,Borghese Fango Active Mud Face and Body,0/0,1.0,Loved the product! Was disappointed that the sender did not package it right and it showed up in a broken jar.
4122,McDavid Ankle with Strap,0/0,4.0,"There's so much Velcro on it that it gets tangled up in itself when you are trying to put it on or remove it, and if you don't put it back together when you are done with it, it will catch on (and ruin) everything it comes in contact with.It does give fair ankle support, and I definitely feel more stable (my problem is weak ankles, not an injury) when I'm wearing it than not, but still. I would wish for a little less side-to-side wobble.These are definitely sized for men. I'm an adult female with medium bone structure, and I'm in a Small."
4123,Marina Deluxe Floating Thermometer with Suction Cup,1/1,5.0,Was skeptical about the accuracy as did not want the fishes above the comfort zone.Very accurate and would recommend it strongly to any one considering buying this.
4124,Toysmith Robot Claw,0/0,4.0,"Much better construction and durability than many of the &#34;grabbers&#34; sold to orthopedic patients or sold in Walmarts for reaching high or distant shelf items for the elderly. And no...of course it's not sold for that, but it's much better and more durable than the ones which are. Easier to operate for many people with arthritis, too."
4125,Charms Sweet Pops Assorted Flavors - 100 Lollipops/Box,0/0,5.0,Loved them. Can't find them in Memphis. Wish they would put a few more orange and strawberry in the box.
4126,Crayola 16 Count Metallic FX Crayons,0/0,5.0,"Good Crayons, cool metallic, showed up in 1 piece and on time. We are glad to deal with good sellers"
4127,Mint Flavor-Alcohol Free (Organic) - 2 oz - Liquid,1/1,3.0,"Just be aware this is mint flavored oil. Anything you put it in will be oily as it does not dissolve. May be fine for cooking, but not so good for flavoring drinks and such."
4128,Roux Fanci-full Rinse #49 Ultra White Minx,1/1,1.0,This product does not work for me. I find it to be very &#34;heavy&#34; on my hair and does not take the yellow out.
4129,Pecoware / Thomas the Tank Engine Spoon and Fork Set,0/0,5.0,I have twin boys and they love these! We have to wash them several times a day because they love eating with them. The set is of high quality and very durable.
4130,Gymnic Rody Horse,0/0,5.0,Purchased for a grandchild. He loves it. We would advise supervision if the child is younger than 2 years old.
4131,"Trophy Animal Dyne, Gallon",0/0,5.0,The Dyne is great for pups as well as bitches recovering. Is working great for us. And it seems it taste good cause I have a few dogs who are picky an they love it.
4132,Chupa Chups Lollipops Assorted 5lb,1/2,5.0,i've ordered it for my girlfriendand she loves it.she told me it's not Mini size as a lot of the reviews are sayingshe said it's real chupa chups with original flavors
4133,Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper,2/2,5.0,"it's a great toe nail clipper. sharp, fast, sleek (sometimes too sleek to hold but it takes a bit of practice). I like the sleek design because it's easy to clean and disinfect. I used to have to cut multiple times with other clippers; but not with the seki, just one cut. I'm not sure what other reviewers mean when they say poor construction. These clippers feel hefty in my hand, more so than other drug store brand clippers I've purchased in the past. I really like this clipper."
4134,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,5.0,"My cat is 14 years old and jumps on the bed every night. But we all know how our joints feel as we get older! I figured if she could learn how to use these stairs she might prefer it over jumping up and down. Sure enough, it took her just a second to figure out the benefits of the steps. Perfect height up to the bed and she uses it all the time! Thank you for making my baby's life a little easier!"
4135,Celery Seed Extract by Natural Factors 60 Capsules,4/4,5.0,I have used it twice daily for the past year and it keeps me from having any flareups of gout.
4136,Perfecting Serum&#174;,0/0,4.0,This product is amazing for dry skin. I live in the desert and get really dry. Great primer before your foundation.
4137,"Yardley English Lavender Moisturizing Body Wash, 14 Oz",0/0,4.0,"I grew up using the bar version of this soap. If you love lavender you can't beat the scent. It's fragrant yet not obnoxiously overpowering. However, it took quite a bit of product to get a good lather and I went through it pretty quickly. If you really like this product, you will get a lot more product for a lot less money by using the bar instead of the liquid."
4138,"Vetri-Science Perio-Support, 4.2 Ounce.",2/2,5.0,"A very little bit of this goes a long way so I am pleased with the price of the bottle given the amount. We mix it into the Meow Mix line of small cups of cat food that used to come in pouches since that happens to be a treat for our cats. It's a littler harder to mix into the all-natural cans that aren't as full of gravy, but if you do it when you first pop the can and then gently reheat the stuff to room temp before serving, they'll take it without giving you the ole Kitteh-Kat stink-eye! We also sometimes sneak it into tuna water for our oldest who doesn't like ""da gushy fudz"" but who needed 3 people to hold her and 2 to sedate her for her one and only teeth cleaning and still 3 people got sliced and diced! We call her our Cat-The-Ripper!This being the case, when I got the bottle, I called up my Vet and read him the ingredients over the phone. He had to do a little research and called me back reminding me that training a cat or dog from infancy to accept a pet toothbrush with poultry flavored paste is the BEST way to stay on top of tarter before it even has a chance to form into Biofilm which then hardens into tarter, he gave this product the OK as a back-up plan. Only 1 of my cats (we have 3) accepts a pet toothbrush and even then only those finger brushes you slip over your thumb. Still, he gave us his full support but asked us to ramp up our use slowly, starting with 1/4 the recommended dose and increasing that every two days and now we've been at full strength for a while. His feeling was, if you won't or they won't let you brush their teeth, anything is better than nothing so long as it's not made of harmful ingredients. There are some mushroom derivatives in here so if you have a cat with some strange allergy to edible mushrooms (and not merely fungi like ringworm that live in the ground and cause rashes on cats), show this to your vet. Mine was fine with the ingredient list, having seen the product in use with other clients plus he knows my pets very well. He's eager to see how ours respond.Perio-Support is only our second try at a preventative. Our first was with a water addative and that didn't work at all since none of the pets would drink and also we keep their water super fresh so we were wasting a lot of product. No, this powder seems to be a good fall-back. It's too soon to see any huge difference in the one cat with the beginnings of brown lines on her fangs but she eats it happily. We have seen no increase in Kitteh-Kat blorphing of food or just stomach juices which happenes with older cats, cats who sneak out and eat grass, or cats like Cat-The-Ripper who occasionally inhale too much dry food they love and forget to chew it well. In fact, we've seen a minor downturn in hairball up-chucks in Cat-The-Ripper who is a HUGE cat (not fat; just really huge for a cat) who has longer hair and therefore grooms a lot more. The Perio-support seems to be helping her out with that. All 3 cats eat the stuff if we mix it well into the can as soon as we open it, even the expensive stuff with less gravy.I'll have to come back in 6 months time and tell you if we see a difference but I'm going to keep buying just to see if the hairball reduction is a real effect. There are so MANy happy customers that I believe this stuff can work, even for Cat-The-Ripper!"
4139,Tin Iron,0/0,1.0,"This was NOT the original photo for the item when I purchased it. The photo shown was a toy iron, which is what I thought I was purchasing. There were even comments below that referred to the item as a child's toy iron."
4140,"PSI German Pin Brush Large, 9 1/2 in. long",0/0,4.0,"I'm not crazy, just practical. :DIn the past I have had so much trouble finding a good brush that won't tangle my long hair. The little balls at the end of each bristle on a regular brush get caught in my fine hair, in essence defeating the purpose of brushing. There are some brushes out there that don't have those little tips, but they come from hair salons and start at twenty-five dollars. This is a practical substitution- despite the dog on the cover!"
4141,LeapFrog Leapster Learning Game Mr. Pencil's Learn to Draw and Write,0/0,5.0,"My daughter (6 years-old) saw this game advertised on another Leapster game she has and insisted on getting it. She has really enjoyed it. She loves to draw and write, so it is perfect for her."
4142,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,5.0,I didn't know what to expect with this purchase however I have been very happy with the squeegee. I bought this one versus the black because some reviews said the black actually left black streaks. No problems with this one and the base attaches well to the shower wall and doesn't move very easily you have to deliberately move it.
4143,"Bemka.com Russian Ossetra Crown Farmed Caviar, 2-Ounce Jar",3/6,1.0,"This has to be truly a JOKE. Much like all the other caviar available online/amazon and all over the place. All I'm going to say is this -- caviarastrakhan.com (the website is in English)People, please save your money and don't fall for this scam. Paying this kind of money for farmed (or really any kind) caviar is truly absurd and not fair, not to mention that farmed caviar can't even come close to REAL caviar. So save your money, and read on so you can get yourself some real (and best in the world) caviar for half the price.There is a Russian company called CaviarAstrakhan (caviarastrakhan.com), which as their name suggest is actually located in Astrakhan (this is THE only place in the world where the fish species needed to make Beluga, Osetra and Sevruga caviars exist and reproduce in their natural habitat, they are also found on the IRANIAN side but caviar from IRAN is far worse in quality). Genuine Russian caviar is known to be the best in the world, and Astrakhan caviar is considered THE BEST bar none. That being said, this company sells Astrakhan caviar on their website and ships all over the world, they accept payment in dollars or euros. Generally, Beluga caviar is considered to be the BEST kind, but they feature all 3 (Beluga, Osetra, Sevruga) so you can pick and choose what you like, they have special deals and bundles. As an example to compare to this deal here, you can buy one 4oz jar of Beluga caviar for $98 on caviarastrakhan.com while here you would pay $187 for 2oz of farmed caviar (it makes NO sense). That means you're paying $93 an ounce for this farmed caviar here, that's just a few dollars short of what you'd pay for 4oz of the best caviar in the world! You make the choice.NOTE"

4150,PetSafe Staywell Pet Door with Clear Hard Flap,0/0,3.0,"I had a very specific dimension that I needed to fit in my garage door where I was installing this dog door. This was the only one that had the proper height I needed for a large size dog. I have had to purchase about 1 a year because the molded plastic at the hinge breaks. Because I have this size hole in my garage door, I need to keep ordering this door. I wish they would reinforce the hinge area, but I like the door, just don't like it breaking every year."
4151,Aveeno Aveeno Active Naturals Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"I have tried other foaming cleansers and they usually are foam in my hand but when I put them on my face they just dissolve! I really like how this one lathers up! It makes my skin feel very soft! I use my Befine Exfoliating Cleanser with Brown Sugar, Sweet Almond and Oats and then I use this afterwards because I have combination to oily skin and acne prone skin around that time of the month for us ladies! The combination of using those two together makes my skin look and feel great! I would highly recommend it!"

4154,Seachem Purigen 500ml,0/0,5.0,"It's so small you have to use an incredibly fine mesh bag to use it (seachem makes one), but it's worth that pain. My nitrates got under control within a week after I started to use it, which was my main reason to try it."
4155,Remington DA-307 Microscreen 100 Men's Rechargeable Foil Shaver,0/0,5.0,"I ALWAYS BUY REMINGTON, VERY GOOD PRODUCT HAVE HAD 2-3 IN THE PAST 15 YEARS AND ONLY REASON TO REPLACE WAS JUST TO GET A NEW ONE."
4156,Nylabone Durable Dental Dinosaur Chew Toy (Dinosaur Varies),0/0,1.0,this was too hard and wore down my puppy's teeth in one day. the spikes are very sharp and may actually cut your hand if you are tossing it for your dog. do not recommend this product at all. i threw it away.
4157,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,0/0,5.0,"My natural hair color is a mousey brown, and this color comes out as a nice deep red on me. It covers grey and fades beautifully as well. The other thing I like about this brand is that you can mix colors. My doctor recommended this brand because apparently it doesn't have the metals and other toxins that other hair color brands have. It's also not tested on animals."

4159,Graco Bumper Jumper,0/0,5.0,Our first daughter didn't like the jumper but she just didn't like being in one spot!! Our second daughter loves it. She loves to jump around in it and she loves to swing in it. We pull her up where she can't touch the floor and we swing her. She will stay in her jumper for a long time which is great for parents. Esp parents with an older busy body toddler.

4163,Source Naturals Nattokinase 50mg,0/0,4.0,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/D7Cgv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!He told me that Nattokinase works so effectively because it dissolves existing blood clots and fibrin while enhancing the body's production of plasmin and other fibrinolytic agents like urokinase. Researchers agree that nattokinase is 4 times as potent as plasmin and is significantly better than any prescription medication. It works for longer periods of time without any of the dangerous side effects associated with pharmaceuticals.One year ago I was hospitalized with deep venous thrombosis. My major veins were clotted shut from groin to heel in my left leg. I spent 6 months on Coumadin and was told that two thirds of my leg had not resolved but the Coumadin couldn't help any further and that I was doomed with post thrombotic syndrome/post phlebotic pain syndrome and venous insufficiency for the rest of my life. This is when I began to take the natto. In 3 months my high fibrinogen has dropped to a healthy level and the damaged leg is recovering with reduced VI and declining pain. Amazing!"
4164,Mexsana Mexsana Medicated Powder,0/0,5.0,"Our basset hounds deserve the best, and we use this in their ""underarm"" and belly areas for redness or irritations.Gold Bond powder is good, too, but Mexsana seems a bit more effective, and our dogs enjoy having it applied and rubbed in."
4165,Mommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock,1/1,5.0,"I have looked at and installed many different child locks. I like these best for cabinet doors because once the door is pulled on, it locks the door from being closed all the way. That way the kids can not pinch their fingers trying to close the door. I did trim back the catch a little bit to make opening the door a little less difficult for us adults."

4170,Ty Beanie Babies Rocket the Blue Jay,0/0,5.0,"My daughter saw a girl at her school with one of these, and decided she wanted one for Christmas. I believe this is exactly what she is wanting. It's just the right size to go with her other birds (not one of the tiny beanies). It also didn't cost me much, which I love! It arrived in great condition, and didn't take long to get here."

4172,Crayola White Chalk - 12/Pkg,1/1,1.0,"This item is actually the anti-dust chalk and not traditional chalk as pictured. I wanted it for a home remedy for grease stains and couldn't find anything but the anti-dust chalk in stores. This was more but I was excited to see it was still available.Item was shipped direct to my home from a major warehouse club based in Arkansas. The receipt inside said it was 68 cents with free shipping.So, I didn't get what was pictured. It was shipped by a retailer rather than the seller and I paid three times as much. I will be more thorough researching next time or only buy items actually sold by Amazon."
4173,Ravensburger Funny Bunny - Children's Game,0/0,4.0,"My daughter is under the recommended age level for this game at 2 years old, but she loves it. I've really grown fond of the Ravnsburger game line. They are fun, but a lot more educational than a lot of games on the market. This game you can use to teach counting and colors while having fun together as a family. It is simple, but very fun to play. My two older daughters are 9 and 11, and while this game doesn't hold the same educational and entertainment value for them, they still have fun playing with the younger one and in general as a family."
4174,Amazing Herbs Black Seed,8/8,5.0,"I am 57 and have had fibromyalgia for years . I have so much more energy when I take this and the aches and pains have diminished so much I forget I have fibromyalgia. I have been able to rake my very large yard and do hand sewing without the terrible swelling and pain in the evening or the following day. I had been off my pain meds due to a terrible lag time from my doctor's office and my pharmacy and now I am considering going without to see how much benefit I can truly reap from black seed oil. After a long day, lying in bed at night used to be very painful, taking at least an hour for my body to &#34; settle&#34; so that I could even try to relax over the pain, especially in my feet. It now takes about five to ten minutes to &#34;settle&#34;. One great benefit is that my spider veins on my legs are disappearing. That's such a confidence booster, for older women in particular. I really don't like to go to the doctor, but the last time I was there they said my chlorestoral was up. I think that the black seed oil will prove to be working on that as well. And one last thing, the extra weight around my middle has been reduced, and I have only started taking black seed oil about three and a half weeks ago. I feel very happy and excited to have found something that works for me on SO many levels. The down side is that I can only find this online right now. I wish it were in a local store to avoid shipping costs. But that is quibbling, I will continue to seek this out which ever way I can. For those with fibromyalgia, please, give it a try."
4175,Baby Toys,0/0,5.0,My babies from 6 months up to my 5 year old love this toy. Matching the shapes and faces is fun for the older ones and the heads of the eggs on the inside squeek for the little people. Large enough that you don't worry about babies putting them in their mouth. Great toy!
4176,"Adaptil, D.A.P (Dog Appeasing Pheromone) Collar for Medium to Large Dogs - 27.6""",0/1,1.0,"Our Chocolate Lab has a lot of anxiety/fear issues & we bought this after his trainer from puppy school recommended it, hoping it would help appease his anxiety a little. Honestly did not make the slightest difference in his behavior. We tried it for the first time right before a 3hr car ride (he usually has anxiety in the car) and to my surprise, his anxiety was actually WORSE than it normally is in the car. I tried checking the papers inside to see if there was a Money Back Guarantee, but there isn't. Very upset I wasted so much money on this. :("
4177,"Truform 20-30 Below Knee Open-Toe, Beige, Large",0/0,5.0,"I have some ankle problems and spend a lot of time on my feet. Sometimes, I put these on after a long day and they provide instant relief. They are not easy to get on, be warned. If you use them like a tight ACE bandage like I do, be warned that sometimes it is painful to get them off. They seem to be holding up really well and justify the expense. They also do a great job of keeping my ankles from swelling on plane rides. I purchased them for a 14 hour flight from LAX to Bangkok and they were a lifesaver. Possibly literally as they prevent blood clots too. I liked them so much that I purchased a second pair."
4178,Wahl 4120-200 All-Body Massage Powerful Therapeutic Massager in Pharmacy Box,0/0,5.0,"I know a lot of girls have been reviewing the benefit for their own private area but I have been using this for the past few months on my injured shoulders. I have had a few shoulder injuries over the past few years, along with physical therapy to get rid of the scar tissue. I still work out and can't really get a massage every other day so I figured I could use a good massager. After reviews I got this and I am very happy.They give you a lot of different heads to use but I stick to two of the mostly to get in between the area between your arm and chest where they connect. I can feel the head hitting the exact spot that is stiff and after 10-20 minutes it is feeling much better and my arms are a lot looser.My girlfriend also gets knots in her neck a lot and loves it when I use this on her to get them out. This can get much deeper and won't get tired like my hands when I'm massaging her or myself...which means I can watch TV and zone out while it does the work."
4179,"Thayer Witch Hazel Toner AF w/Aloe Vera Formula Vitamin E, Lavender 12 oz",0/0,5.0,I really enjoy this product it doesn't irritate my skin as smells very nice. I apply it with a washcloth in the mornings and my skin doesn't get oily during the day.
4180,"PetSafe In-Ground Deluxe Ultralight Collar with Radio Receiver, PUL-275",0/0,4.0,"My items arrived promptly and in great condition however, one of the collars batteries died within the first week. This has happened before with this same type of collar. Im not pleased with the fact that I pay so much for something that dies so soon."
4181,Aloe life Skin Gel - 8 oz - Liquid,2/2,5.0,"When I was breaking out really badly, my friend gave me some of this and told me to use it as a spot treatment. I was pretty confused at first because I never though aloe would do anything for acne, but the next day my acne was sooooo much better! I have tried pretty much all the spot treatments, (benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid, ect.) but nothing has worked even close to as well as this does! Plus it doesn't burn like most spot treatment, which is great for my sensitive skin. Now I rarely ever get acne! I've also noticed that when I rub some on my t-zone it helps reduce some of the oil (and I have REALLY oily skin). Also, I noticed that Aloe Life Skin Gel works the best out of all the different brands of aloe vera because it is 99% aloe vera (and has vitamins) unlike the drugstore brands. Overall, I'm so glad I found this product, it has made a HUGE difference in my skin tone!"

4184,Pedifix Pedi-quick Step-n-smooth Shower Foot File Mat,0/0,2.0,"If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or don't have good balance, don't get this! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place. You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time. I ended up using in on the carpeted floor, sitting on the couch and even then, it was difficult to file every angle of my heel. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good file on your feet."
4185,Magna-Tiles Clear Colors 32 piece set,0/0,4.0,My grandson age 6 enjoyed it. He is very interested in building and how things fit together so it is a good toy for him

4198,Mill Creek Biotene H-24 Conditioning Hair Spray -- 8.5 fl oz,0/0,5.0,"This is the second bottle I have purchased. It beats any hairspray I have found, at a reasonable price. No stickiness, and great hold. I do put it into a smaller fine spray bottle. The nozzle on the original bottle is hard to pump, the first bottle I bought the nozzle did not work at all. But that is an easy remedy and didn't stop me from buying it again. There is virtually no fragrance to it and it holds all day long without looking stiff or tacky."

4226,Action Air Treasure Chest Live-Action Aerating Aquarium Ornaments,0/0,4.0,"I love the idea of the diver going up and down as the treasure chest opens and closes. Unfortunately, the chains attaching the diver to the chest are cheaply made, so the diver came off and I had to sort of rig him so he stays attached to the chest. Due to the rigging, he doesn't go up and down when the chest opens and closes."

I sent an email to the vendor, got no response. I threw it away as I will not use a suspect product on my dogs and ordered elsewhere from a reputable company. This is an example of when the cheap becomes expensive or if you do not read the back of the product before applying to your dog might be deadly."

Then I checked the net for the same product. I got it and have been using it for relief. I did discover that is powerful enough to get to be too hot for me. With its digital temp setting I can get it &#34;Just Right&#34; with power to spare. This is not your Walmat, K-mart, or other &#34;Store Quality&#34; heating pad, this is serious strength.

Maybe it was a gift from a client, but it wasalways an easy thing to slice off a piece and serve it up on a plate with some milk for us kids, or coffee for my dad. It isthe Claxton boxed regular recipe fruitcake that my spouse wanted for his Thanksgiving. He doesn't eat many sweets, so Iwas very pleased to locate the regular one at Amazon. Finding this fruitcake for him is right up there with discovering the old &#34;leg lamp&#34; (Darren McGavin loved it, you remember) is still available--although I must admit that lamp is not on MY wish list!! But it is always great to revisit memories of Christmas past.Since this particular cake is now a memory, I plan to order another one--or two--for Christmas. It keeps as long as you need, even if you don't eat a slice every day!"

4247,Canidae Dog Treats Snap Biscuits,0/0,2.0,"The Canidae snap biscuits arrived promptly and well packed. The box flap is difficult to open and needs a design modification. I would guess most users end up ripping it or bending it to work easier.I broke up one of the biscuits and offered one piece to my mini poodle. He pushed it around, put it in his mouth and than tossed it to the floor. He did not like the flavor, being very particular when it comes to food. So fortunately,I have a neighbors dog (black lab) who is not as particular and he is enjoying these biscuits.I appreciate the good ingredients and nutritional benefits from this product, but if my dog won't eat it, I can only give it two stars.Perhaps a sample pack of the various flavors would be helpful for consumers."

4250,"Hope's Floor Revive, Floor Shine (16 Ounces)",0/0,5.0,"I have an old house and an old linoleum floor. I've used this product for years and can't find another product that works as well to bring back the shine. The finish lasts for at least a month in the heavy traffic areas of my floor, and longer on the remainder of the floor. Highly recommended!"
4251,"Cica Care Silicone Gel Sheeting 5 x 6 Inch, Sterile",0/0,1.0,"I was really mad after I used this product. You literally get one sheet for $50 or so. It claims to be able to stay on until you take it off. Nope. I had to use strips of medical tape to keep it on and even then, it would flop off."
4252,Wellness WellBar Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,"I have 3 chihuahuas and they LOVE the Wellness biscuits. It gives them something to chew on for a while instead of an instant treat. Wellness has proven their dedication to the health of your dogs and I really appreciate their efforts. I only feed my dogs Wellness. Great service, prompt delivery."
4253,"Conair TS7NR Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter, Jumbo",0/0,1.0,"So you can compare to your hair type to my review, I have long, thick, and soft hair with a slight wave that typically curls easily.First, it is hard to put these rollers in your hair. There is a slit in the roller where it straddles a metal bar to heat up. When you try to put a u-shaped clip in, it often gets stuck in the slit. I tried the clamps at 3 different angles and they kink my hair.Next, these don't curl your hair well. I let them heat up longer, left them in longer, tried using hairspray while they were in, but nothing worked.The worst part is they don't stay in your hair well once you finally get them in. I tried rolling up with less hair to make my hair curl better, but then the rollers just slide out of my hair. The last straw was when one of the rollers slid out of my hair and fell in the toilet at a hotel.Done with this set, and they went to the trash!!I hope to find some of the plastic kind in at least 1.5"" size. I will take burning my fingers over the problems I had with this set."

4255,"Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, Blackest Black - .43 Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,Ladies always ask me what brand I buy and are shocked to hear that I don't spend $25 a tube. I've used this brand for 20 years and will continue to do so!
4256,Siege Chemical 766L Porcelain And Enamel Cleaner,0/0,5.0,"Works perfect on Fiesta Ware, it takes the gray marks off very fast. My old standby, Pfaltzgraff Cleaner (off market about 2 years) does not work as fast or as well as the Siege Cleaner. I'm thankful to finally find a cleaner for my dishes that works great and is available, and I will re-order Siege from now on. I don't understand the negative reviews since I found this product to be far superior.Siege Chemical 766L Porcelain And Enamel Cleaner"

4259,Exclusively Pet Best Buddy Bits,0/0,5.0,I have small dogs that love treats but the grocery store sells much larger treats and I don't want my dogs to gain weight so these are perfect. Funny thing about dogs...they are just happy to get a treat and don't seem to care how big it is!
4260,"PRI Folding Potty with Handles, White granite",0/0,5.0,If you use it properly it works just fine. Of course it is not as sturdy or cushy as a padded home potty ring. I love its portability. It fits in a pocket in my diaper bag. The lip must be flush with the front edge of the potty or it is unstable. I haven't had problems with pinching at the joints but then again my kid doesn't squirm on the potty.I love this potty ring. It makes for successful pottying when out and about.
4261,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/1,5.0,This tea was referred to me via Dr. Oz show. It is used to discourage cravings late in the day/night. It has a pleasant flavor unlike I expected. Give it a try.

4263,Original Claire Burke Reed Fragrance Diffuser Gift Set,0/0,3.0,Not much of a fragrance. But I guess it is working. I can't really tell. I don't think I will buy this item again.
4264,Granite Gold Granite Gold Stone & Tile Floor Cleaner GG0210,0/0,3.0,"Based on my use, soap and water would have done the same thing. Save your money and just use soap and water."

4266,"Revlon RV519 1875 Watt Ion Select Dryer, Black",0/0,5.0,"Bought it based on one just like it I bought years ago , love how it dryes my hair and doesn't make a terrible sound while running. I would highly reccomend this product."
4267,"Spot Shot 009716 Instant Carpet Stain &amp; Odor Eliminator, 22 oz.",0/0,3.0,It works but buy it in the store. It is overpriced here. I found much cheaper at Big Lots. Works as described.
4268,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"i don't know if it's pampers or this particular distributor, but there are what seems to be dried up resins in lumps in the diapers. i wonder if they absorbed moisture then dried. i'll never buy another pampers diaper."
4269,"Natural Balance Beef Formula Dog Food Roll, 4-Pound",0/0,5.0,"But my dog does....! And that's what counts...! She's a very finicky eater -- so finding even a &#34;dog food&#34; has been a challenge for us. (Currently order &#34;Chicken Soup for the Dog's Soul&#34; thru Amazon) ... but even at that, unless there is an &#34;incentive&#34; for her in the bowl WITH the food (i.e., cheese...?) she'll often let it just &#34;sit&#34; for a day or two before she gets desperate. Adding the beef roll seems to entice her with its aroma (and apparently taste...?) so that she's a much more enthusiastic diner."
4270,Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,I ordered this toy for Christmas gift to my friend's daughter!she was very happy with this mirror.i will recommend it to my friends.and price was very good)
4271,"Hypafix Dressing Retention Tape- 4"" x 10 yds - Each",0/0,5.0,"Item arrived promptly and in good condition.The price is reasonable. I loved this tape when I was a practicing RN, and still love it as a patient. Once the body heat grips it, it will stay in place until you actually peel it off off for the next dressing. Does not hurt to remove. Do not put in it directly on wound, but it will hold most dry & moist treatments without leakage. Wonderful stuff."
4272,"Plush 8"" Classic Curious George in Red Shirt",0/0,5.0,It was a very easy to love and hold toy. Would never find it in any department store. Will look for more Curious George items they are favorites in this family.
4273,POSTURE-PRO Adjustable Double Diner,0/0,5.0,We have two large dogs and this diner is perfect for them. Very sturdy legs and very adjustable height. I wish the bowls were just a bit heavier stainless but it is not really an issue.I would highly recommend.
4274,Ecco Bella Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil,0/0,5.0,"Being so allergic to all mascaras, someone at Sephora suggested this product (they don't carry it). Tried it and I can wear it!!! 1/3 the cost of Clinique and Lancome that used to be my choice and this looks great and doesn't clump in the corners. Only thing is it does smudge by the end of the day."
4275,Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs,0/0,5.0,"These were fine. Functional, hard to pull out from the plug, which serves the purpose just fine. Although, iRecommend this product."
4276,Bittersweet Paprika Tin,0/0,5.0,"Ever since I found this particular paprika in the store, I was hooked! &#34;Regular&#34; grocery store popular brands do not hold a candle to the smokey flavor of this Spanish paprika! I have even gotten the &#34;ahumado&#34; or smoked paprika which is really wonderful and intense. Now that I can't find it anymore in my own neighborhood, I get it from Amazon and the price is reasonable. Don't hesitate to try this brand!"
4277,Progressive Vitamin Dispenser,0/0,5.0,"I was unsure about ordering this as so many complained that the dispenser opening was not big enough for larger vitamins.Maybe the manufacturer changed the opening design? I find it works just fine, even for inch long B/C vitamin capsules. It is very sturdy, well made, and convenient. Not tiny by any means but if you want to keep six different supplements in one handy container then well, they take up space!Nice item, works just fine, much better than having to bother with multiple bottles. Very pleased."
4278,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"This is the second night light I have purchased and it is so much nicer then the cheaper ones you will see in the stores this year.Bought the first one last year (turtle) for may sweet grand-girl (4 years old), and she loves it.

4279,Liz Claiborne Curve Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,This has a sophisticated smell that I just love! If your looking for an original no-fruity perfume this is it. This bottle will last for like 10 to 11 months. I just bought this one and the last time I purchased one was in March of 2012. I still have a little left from the bottle from March and I use it 5 to 6 days a week with about 3 to 4 sprays.

4287,Power Wheels 6-Volt Rechargeable Battery,0/0,3.0,"works a bit but has lower voltage then 6 V, it's less then 4 volts after charging for over 18 hrs as indicated. I can see some stickers were pulled off of it compared to the one I already had. I don't know how &#34;new&#34; this battery really is/was."
4288,"Citrus Magic, Fruit & Veggie Wash, 16 oz",0/0,4.0,Fruit seemed cleaner and the wax was washed off. I think water and soap would work fine but I wanted to try this stuff out. I only have to use a little bit at a time.
4289,Lavilin Foot Deodorant Cream,0/1,5.0,This product is excellent for controlling foot odor. You only have to apply it once every two to three weeks. It worked for me!

4291,Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord,0/0,2.0,"Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord. It broke within the first week. For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor. It broke right away. Although it is OK, it is not one that I would have selected just as a hairdryer."
4292,DaVinci Kalani Combo Baby Dresser,1/1,5.0,Putting together this dresser was pretty easy with one person but recommended with 2 person. Quality of dresser is excellent. We'll find this dresser being a great peice of furniture that will last for a long time. We are very happy with this purchase and recommend it. look foward in getting the 4 drawer next.
4293,"KONG Puppy Kong Toy, Small, Assorted Pink/Blue",0/0,5.0,"So my 65lbsboxer mix can chew through ANYTHING, except for KONG toys, and tennis balls. So when we decided to get new puppies, I knew KONG was the way to go for their toys!"
4294,HERRERA For Men By CAROLINA HERRERA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/1,1.0,I received this and the bottle was broken. The box was wet from the cologne spilling all over it and I am not able to return or even contact anyone!!!!! Very upset right now!!!!
4295,Alterna Caviar Complex Work Spray,0/0,5.0,"I love this product and have been using it for years now, a bit expensive but worth it.

4296,Numi Organic Tea Flowering Gift Set in Handcrafted Mahogany Bamboo Chest,3/4,1.0,Are negative stars possible!!!! Moldy on the outside and the insides. Looked like some sort of insect eggs as well. AWFUL. And it absolutely sucks that it cannot be returned.
4297,"4 Wheel Rolling Walker with Shopping Basket, Padded Seat Burgundy Color",0/0,5.0,"My girlfriend's mom was having trouble with her original fold-up walker. It only had two wheels, no seat, no brakes and was basically just a bare aluminum frame. She was a bit hesitant when she saw this one but now takes it everywhere. She loves the storage compartment and uses the seat to put things on when mocing around the house. This has greatly increased her mobility and quality of life. Great design, well made."
4298,Aveeno Anti Itch Soothing Bath Treatment - 4.5 Oz,0/0,5.0,"It is thicker than the cheaper brands though you need to take time for it to desolve. Otherwise, crumps will surface. I found that by emptying the powder under the bath water spout early, it desolved better. The baithing water with this mixture is thicker in texture, like more creamy color to it and feels like your are in a expensive Spa. Tammy"
4299,CERRUTI 1881 For Women By NINO CERRUTI Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"excelente producto en buenas condiciones bien sellado el produccto es el que se promocionaba, estoy satisfecha con mi compra lo recomiendo."

4303,Facial Sauna Systems with Timer,0/0,5.0,"I love this machine. Could I say anymore...I will. I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this. It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean. You can use it every day, or night and the results will be amazing.It works well for your sinuses too. I put this on my counter and lean over it, just don't wiggle it or hit it while it is on. It has been safe for me and heats up fast. I really love my machine.The brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn't waterproof and eventually broke."
4304,Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper,0/1,5.0,"This is the best toe nail clipper I have purchased. It is sharp, and cuts my nails without chipping. It is well designed which makes it easy to hold and manipulate. My grand-daughter is even confident when I use it on her because she sees howquickly and painlessly her nails are cut."
4305,Fisher-Price Toddlerz Chatter Telephone,0/0,3.0,"Ok so when I first saw this phone on amazon it was a picture of the chatter phone with buttons, not the spin dial thing. So I decided to order it. When it was delivered I opened it immediately and saw that it had the spin dial. I took it to my house and let my niece play with it, it's her xmas gift, and she looked at it picked it up handed it to me rolled her eyes and walked away. I guess I have to get her somethin else because she definitely won't play with this. Other than that, it was delivered the day after I placed my order so super fast delivery"
4306,Jetfire Twin Pack,0/1,4.0,This was purchased as a gift which has yet to be delivered to the recipient. At this moment I have to believe all is ok.

4308,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,1.0,"Unfortunately this product did nothing for my 5 cats who are still fussing with each other. I've tried 2 plugins going simultaneously, 1 on each floor of my house in open areas several times over the course of 2 years.... so there's been plenty of time for it to work. These cats are siblings who were raised together. I don't understand why the 2 females are still territorial, spraying wherever they want, and hissing at each other. hey were all neutered at 6 months, they all come and go through their cat door. Other people seem to have success with this product, but not us."
4309,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,2/2,5.0,You know exactly what you will be doing with this product!!! Start low then switch to high and BAM! No batteries to go dead at the wrong time.
4310,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",0/0,5.0,It works great and it really through's them off balance when they start barking. The good part about it it smells OK.
4311,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,1/1,1.0,"Back years ago this scent was somewhat ok, I remember having a small bottle of it someone gave me.I thought I would enjoy it again so asked for it as a gift.I was wrong.It was heavy and gave me somewhat of a headache.It's to old lady like.And very musky.I wouldn't recommend this scent.I sold it on ebay.I have noticed yellow or golden colors of perfume are too strong and musky."
4312,Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic,0/0,5.0,"I love Nutiva Coconut oil. I wash my face with it, I use it for dry skin and chapped lips, I give it to my dogs and cats, I put it in tea, I cook with it....This is a great size and is cheaper than I can find in local stores. Love this."
4313,Badger Basket White Doll Crib With Cabinet Bedding And Mobile - Pink/White,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this for a Christmas present and didn't put it together right away. I took my time and laid everything out separately and read through the instructions before I started. It went together sturdily - only needed help from my husband with one of the bolts that didn't quite want to catch. Took about two hours but that was while watching a football game, so it would not have taken nearly that long a period of solid concentration. Obviously I don't know yet how it will hold up but I think, like anything, it depends on how it's treated by the child. Once I got to the point of putting the ends on, I put the bolts into one end, laid it on the floor and attached the two sides (didn't try to tighten those bolts at all), then slid the back and two bottoms into place and attached the other end. I could then turn it back over and tighten the last four bolts."
4314,4711 Cologne by Muelhens for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,My really favorite smell. I love it. Buying online cheaper than in stores. And it is a headache to find it there.

4317,Source Naturals Wellness Zinc Lozenges,0/0,5.0,"All zinc chewables leave a metallic aftertaste, but this one has the least aftertaste, and the tablet itself is yummy. It also has a high amount of zinc in it--one of the highest I've found. Great price."
4318,Nylabone Galileo Bone Dog Chew Toy,0/0,3.0,I have bought many of these in the past. My older/larger dog loved them. My current dog doesn't care for it. Oh well.

4321,"Solgar - Essential Amino Complex, 60 veggie caps",1/2,1.0,"This won't apply to everyone. I regularly get migraines and am very careful of what I put in my body. I took this three times and all three times, I ended up with migraines. I sent these back."
4322,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,"I don't know why, but it seemed like the dogs would like having the slight elevation, and indeed they do. It's like getting on the furniture, I guess that's why. Also, it's easier for my dog who is older and large and clunky and doesn't jump so well. She can elevate herself by simply stepping up, it's not very tall, but tall enough. It's cool. Someone else put it together for me, I wouldn't have wanted to have to do it."
4323,Realistic Full Size Rubber Mouse Halloween Gag,0/0,4.0,Can't beat this even at double price --$3 shipped terrific. Nicely realistic for rubber. Startled nicely or gag as intended.

4325,Philips Sonicare IntelliClean System Brush Head Refill,0/0,3.0,Ok but overpriced brush refills. Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much and you have to replace too often.
4326,10 Days in Africa Game,0/0,5.0,We have the 10 Days in Africa as well as the 10 Days in Europe and we love Them both! They are very educational for the kids and for the adults. I would highly recommend them for families with school age kids.

4328,Cricket Static Free Sculpting 680,0/0,5.0,"Best brush to use when blow drying straight hair. It replaces my worn out (and, sadly, discontinued) Aveda styling brushes. I plan to order more!"
4329,Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light,1/1,4.0,"I have been using this type of Vick's model for about 7 years and here is what I have found works (many of these have already been listed in other reviews):-- If you have a water softener, this will work just fine. If you don't and you have hard water, adding salt is a requirement (you are essentially boiling water with this model)-- Cleaning - Water minerals will be left behind so you may see black particles or even larger chunks in the water.The particles should just be just dumped out, rinse the container and add new water. If you see larger chunks, you absolutely need to clean the unit (per Vick's instructions). I've always just unscrewed the unit and cleaned off the build-up. NOTE"
4330,Crystal Stick For Men 1 Unit Crystal Body Deodorant,0/0,1.0,I like the idea and I have heard great things about this product so I gave it a try. I did not like the application and it really did not perform to my satisfaction.
4331,Slumber Pet Thermal Cat Mat,0/0,5.0,My Canadian cat spends all day on her thermal mat instead of our other furniture. It will be great for our cold winter days and nights.

4333,Cardinal Laboratories E-Collar,0/0,5.0,My cat has a spot he wont stop licking so I got this to help out. I am glad that I got the medium. He is a 20lb cat and i lock it on the 3rd notch. It took a while for him to get used to it and now he can get around fine he just runs away sometimes when I try to put it back on him. I will be very happy when I don't need this anymore but until then it is doing its job.
4334,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,It is a good water pik. It is a bit loud and gets your bathroom messy if your not careful. Do need to refil with warm water before each use because the cold water seems colder when it is sprayed on your teeth.Works nicely.

4336,Derma e Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid Eye Creme,0/0,1.0,"The item pictured is the old square box holding a jar of eye cream. In fact, what is shipped is a thin rectangular box with a small tube of eye cream that is thinner than the old product in the jar. It is also difficult to use since it is impossible to control the amount that is squeezed out at any time and impossible to see how much is left or use the last bit of cream in the tube.Three times I have called Amazon to try to verify what would be shipped and three times got the wrong product (surprised at Amazon!) Do not purchase without knowing what you are getting."

4339,Bowsers Donut Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"I don't review many things, but this one I felt compelled. In the past, I've had two german shepherds and now I have a 75lb 3-year old mutt who grew way too fast. We started with regular ""x-large"" dog beds, but by the time she was two, she looked like a giant on a tiny bed - head and feet always flopping over the sides.This bed is HUGE! She fits comfortably, even large enough for her to bring her ""friends"" in and sleep with her. The height & firmness of the bolster is perfect for her big ol head and she loves being on her bed more than anything! She was in it before we could even get it out of the box, and we've easily trained her that that's home-base during meal times and when she gets her snack.Last thing"
4340,Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,0/0,3.0,The product is exactly as it is shown. The anchors they send with it are weak. I would recommend you buy stronger and bigger anchors and hooks.

4346,Oster Hi-Velocity Stand Dryer,0/0,5.0,"I see this product listed as ""currently not available"" and I am in a panic! Our 25 year old Oster stand dryer is still doing a great job, but the arm doesn't stay in position any more, so I was thinking about replacing it and keeping the old one as a back-up. As a cat show exhibitor, I do NOT want it to finally die on me in the middle of grooming for an important show.What sets this unit apart from the competition (aside from durability!) is the noise factor. I do not need a unit that blows a cat off of the table. If that is your style of grooming, go for the Metro. Having a unit that doesn""t scare a kitten or give me a headache by the time I am done is essential. The ""air only"" function (no heat) is perfect for finishing longhaired cats.This unit is rather expensive, if I remember correctly, but for a workhorse that has been used once a week for 25 years, I can't consider buying anything esle. Please tell me it isn't permanently discontinued!!"

4352,Natural Eyes,0/0,5.0,"I bought these for my son, who wears glasses with numbers off the chart. When I heard about these glasses I spoke to him about buying them for his and he said his father in law used them and yes I could buy them for him. The first time he used them he said he could not believe he could read the wall clock which usually was just a blob on the wall without glasses. He has been using them a few minutes a dayand seems to be seeing better. He is happy and so am I, with time I hope that his vision will keep on improving."
4353,Osmotics Blue Copper 5 Firming Elasticity Repair,3/3,5.0,"I am always trying to find a good face moisturizing product, notably, one where I don't wake up in the morning with a break-out from the moisturizer. So far, this Blue Copper 5 seems good. Convenient, not too oily, just enough moisture. Not sure if it meets up to it's description of promoting younger looking skin, but, I have been getting compliments lately on how young I look. Not sure if it's coincidence or something else I'm doing."

It is very comfortable, made of high quality materials, has kept its shape and it does a terrific job blocking the light from your eyes.

4361,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,5.0,This is the 2nd set of these I've purchased. I have a 5 lb yorkie who loves to snooze in my bed but can't jump up and down himself. He loves these stairs! They are super sturdy and I absolutely trust him going up and down on them. They couldn't be easier to assemble. Just snap the back out into place and attach the carpet for each snap which sticks on. Also comes with little pads for the bottom so it doesn't slide. Would highly recommend
4362,Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Freezer Trays With Lids,0/0,3.0,The trays are made of such thick plastic that when they are frozen it is impossible to twist them to get the cubes out. I have to let them thaw on the counter for 20 min before the food will pop out.
4363,PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box,0/0,5.0,"this is the 3rd one I have ordered. The first one lasted over 5 years! That indicates a quality product to me. The 2nd one made a squeaky noise from day 1. When I contacted the company, they replaced it within days. Their customer service was excellent!!! My cats stopped using the regular kitty litter box, preferring this one instead."

The string started unraveling within 2 hrs of putting it on. It is about to fall apart after 1st / only time he wore it. It 'can ' be fixed but why should I have to FIX it????
4366,"Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce",0/0,4.0,"The sandalwood cream lathers real quickly and you wouldn't need more than four dabs of cream to work up some rich lather with a badger shaving brush. Did feel that lathering and fragrance are better than the TOBS lavender version. Face friendly and soothing even if the razor gets a little blunt on the edges. The sandalwood smell is not as strong as one would expect, so it's possible they have acted on customer feedback. Good buy for the price."
4367,Wilton Clear Imitation Vanilla 8 Oz Bottle,0/0,4.0,"I bought Wilton clear imitation vanilla at the craft store; I love the flavor and generally how it works in many of my frostings. However, after having repeated problems with my royal icing turning off-white after drying (it looks bright white after beating in my mixer and while icing cookies but then changes to a yellowish white when dried), I finally poured the bottle into a white mug. It is not truly clear, there is a tint to it. Generally this does not affect colored royal icing or even white buttercream, but for truly white royal icing it has been a problem for me. I will continue to use it for many things since overall it's a very good product."
4368,Sombra Pain-Relieving Gel,0/0,5.0,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. ONE DAY MY NECK WAS SWOLLEN AND I PUTIT ON AND IT TOOK THE PAIN AWAY. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOWMUCH BETTER I WAS. I HAVE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEY DIDNOT WORK AS WELL AS SOMBRA

4370,"Marineland PC-ml360 Multi-stage Canister Filter- 55 to 100-Gallon, 360GPH",0/0,4.0,I own 3 of these and 1 C-220. I just replaced my third one of the C-360 and they all seem to last about three years or so. After that they start blowing air and then leak so they must be replaced. I have gone the repair route and that dosnt work . The valve block and the canister seem to fall apart at the same time. Ido like these filters as they work great with little trouble normaly. My C-220 however has lasted about 6 years. I have no idea why or what the difference is. All said I like them and will continue to buy them.
4371,Snoozer Lookout Car Seat,0/0,2.0,"I bought two for my Chihuahuas. Basically this is a big block of foam the dog sits on top of. One dog kept jumping out and getting hung up on the seat belt. Never use this seat with a collar, only a harness. There is too muh leeway since the tether slides along the length of the seat belt. The only way to make them work right would be to cut a hole through the back and put the tether through that. The other dog did fine, but you never know when a dog will decided to jump out. Not safe to be driving on the freeway while worrying that your dog might be dangling from the seat belt."
4372,Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - 1.25 Ounce Tube,0/0,5.0,This is the best cream for dry hands and feet. It works wonders on dry cracked heels! I love this stuff and I couldn't live without it.

4378,Ocean Wave Drum,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old, who loves music and the ocean, thinks this is the best thing ever. It's not super loud when being used as a drum and is a fun ocean &#34;device&#34; to play with too. I personally had a very hard time getting the stick out of the holder - as did my little one - but overall it seems to be made well and is a great toy."
4379,Worldwide - Pure Protein Shake - 12 Bottles (11oz each),0/0,5.0,The diet plan I am following suggests starting the day with at least 25 grams of protein.

It's a keeper that I will be using for a long time.

4386,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,2/2,5.0,"First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else. But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims. I ordered Pumpkin Pie, and I was instantly impressed. Some flavored lip balms don't taste exactly like their flavor, or taste &#34;processed&#34; or &#34;fake.&#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it's flavor. I'm very impressed.My shipment came on time. The receipt had a little &#34;thank you&#34; and smiley face on it (which was very cute). The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it (great presentation). The balm goes on super smoothly and doesn't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex, but I'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too! I will be ordering another one when this runs out."
4387,Astonish Industries Oven & Cookware Cleaner 17.6 Oz.,0/0,3.0,"I bought this to see if it would be able to remove the (small but noticeable to me) spots/stains on our older, white gas stovetop, but this product didn't do much of anything for it. My Mr. Clean Magic Erasers did a much better job at getting most of the staining, so I'm going to roll up my sleeves and show those few remaining spots no mercy...This Astonish cleaner is a finely gritted white paste and I can see how this would be suitable and effective for many things, but just wasn't (effective) for my primary purpose of the stove top. It does appear just a little of this will go a long way, which makes it a cost-effective product. I did test a small area on some (vintage) mustard-colored cookware, but quickly stopped as it appeared to be causing some surface damage (slightly removing the finish). I'm sure that I will find some other use for it at some point, such as stainless steel, oven interior, vehicle wheels/rims, etc. or something that can handle the grit texture."
4388,North States Supergate Extra Wide Gate,0/0,5.0,Purchased this gate for our daycare to divide the living room and dining room. The price was perfect! The size was perfect!

4392,Universal Nutrition Animal Test,0/0,5.0,"This product always gets the full spectrum of reviews on any website, so be aware that results vary greatly according to your individual training and biochemistry.My ExperienceI took the full 42 day course of Animal Test to break out of a 4 month strength slump. This was my seventh year of dedicated weight training and it had been roughly 2 years since my last hiatus due to injury/lifestyle changes. I began to feel like it was working by week 2 and my lifting numbers were up about 10% in the big three and as much as 30% in assistance excercises by the end of the 6 weeks. I also gained 10 pounds without eating much more. These results pretty well match my bodies reaction to weightlifing stimuli, in that gaining strength is pretty easy and thinking about food piles on the pounds. I was in somewhat of a better mood while taking it, but it was likely a function of feedback from training. For those of you who train, you know how much the feeling of grabbing a comically large weight and dominating the lift carries over to the rest of your life. The body weight stayed on until I went on a diet a few months later and the strength was all there until my recent injury over a year after taking Animal Test.Bigger PictureI did some research on various ingrediants and read a lot of reviews before ordering. All I can say is that you should be ready to closely evaluate how the product is reacting with your body. I had a great experience, but others have reported the following,Increased agressionWeight lossNipple swelling/puffinessAcne/backne outbreaksWorsening stomach painsNo effect at allSo, be prepared to carefully evaluate how you feel during week one of Animal Test. If you feel normal or better, carry on. If negative side effects arise, stop taking immediantly. I would also not recommend this for people under 21, as a lot of the negative reactions I have seen were posted by teens.I liked it so much, I am ordering another two can cycle."

4394,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,5/5,5.0,"In this review, I will make note of tips, tricks, and ways to make the experience with diva cup amazing as well as actually review the product itself. ;)First off, I LOVE my diva cup! The diva cup is an excellent alternative to pads and tampons and is great price-wise since it is reusable! If you are a woman (well, hopefully you are if you are reading this...) and are tired of spending time and money being uncomfortable during that time of the month, I 100% recommend that you purchase the diva cup!There that was my short review! Now onto how to make your experience with diva cup better:1) A lot of women ponder the thought, ""What if my diva cup is too long? Diva cups are the longest menstrual cup on the market..."" Well, when I first got the diva cup, it actually was too long. I could feel it ALL THE TIME. But, I fixed the problem by cutting off part of the stem (yes, you can do that!! :D).2) Insertion can seem impossible when you first open the package and see the size. But trust me, it fits! I find that doubling the diva cup over into a U-shape is the easiest way to insert. Also, to get the best suction possible, as soon as it goes into your vaginal canal, release the diva cup so that it goes into its natural position. Then, push it down the canal as far as it can go!3) When removing the diva cup, you should ALWAYS pinch it first! The diva cup stays down there by suction, so to remove it, you need to release the suction power it has. If you do not pinch it and release its pull, it REALLY hurts to remove!4) There IS a reason it says to wear it for only 12 hours! I tested on the 2nd day of my period wearing it for close to 24 hours. For one thing, it leaked. I have heavy flow and it did overflow after 24 hours... Secondly, and almost worse, the cup smelled bad. Like, really bad...5) Speaking of smelling bad - an important thing to know is how to clean your diva cup! I know a few reviews said not to use soap, but I first wash my hands and then wash the inside and outside of my diva cup with antibacterial soap. The trick is running your hands all over the cup to make sure it is soap-free when you are done! It is also VERY important that you wash your hands prior to cleaning out your diva cup! Also, once a month I boil mine in water. You can add some lemon juice to boiling water if you want it to smell good, FYI. ;)6) If you are in a public place and need to clean your cup, I would use some baby wipes. And if you do not have any, just wipe your cup out with toilet paper. BUT, make sure all the TP is gone when you are done cleaning!7) ALWAYS wash your hands before insertion or removal! Doing so will reduce your chance of getting infections down there!8) EDIT TO ADD"
4395,Jobst For Men 8-15 mmHg Over-The-Calf Sock - in your choice of size and color,0/0,5.0,I need to wear them when I retain water in my legs. They do the job for me at a low cost.
4396,Universal Nutrition Animal Nitro,1/1,5.0,"Animal Nitro is an interesting alternative to your standard post-workout serving of protein powder. I personally find that it far outperforms every powder product I have tried in terms of aiding in post-workout recovery by preventing soreness, both in the short and delayed onset form. Taking the pills in and of itself will not make you bigger or stronger. Instead, the enhanced recovery allows to come back into the gym/bike/field the day after a hard workout and hit the weights just as hard. The most noticeable difference was after leg day, when I would feel comfortable enough to go on 20 mile cycling rides or do strongman training despite being in the squat rack 24 hours earlier.Recovery with Nitro > Recovery with whey protein powder > No supplement recoveryAs a word of caution, make sure you drink a lot of water while taking the pak of horse pills, like a full 16 ozs. They can get stuck in your throat, causing a lot of discomfort, follewed by aspirating protein dust five minutes later. Not to scare anyone off, just helping you to avoid a bad experience."

4409,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,2/2,5.0,"First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else. But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims.

I'm very impressed.My shipment came on time. The receipt had a little &#34;thank you&#34; and smiley face on it (which was very cute). The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it (great presentation).

4419,Optima 365 for DOGS -Gallon,0/0,5.0,"We have a chow chow that is, unfortunately, very dried skinned and has a sensitive stomach. Her skin would get so dry that it would crack, bleed, and her hair would fall out. I tried numerous other products to help her and nothing worked, or if it worked, it upset her stomach. Our vet finally came across Optima 365 several years ago and the difference it made was truly astouding. Her skin started responding immediately and there were no digestive problems with it. She now has a show quality chow chow coat and I have to attribute it to the Optima 365. It truly was a wonder supplement for her and I have suggested Optima 365 to other dog owners who also had friends with problem coats or skin and they also had very satisfactory results with it. When we moved to a different state we were shocked to learn that this product is not carried here - trust me, I called every vet around a 200 mile radius - so I had to have it shipped in from my old vet. Finding that Amazon carries it has been great. I really recommend this product."

New Postum is not even close to Old Postum. It doesn't dissolve the same, it doesn't smell the same, and worst of all it doesn't taste the same. It tastes horrid! NEW Postum is flat out bad. I also agree with another post that the marketing SHOULD NOT say ""Original"" since it clearly is not.Can't be more disappointed in NEW Postum."

4431,"Booda Dome Liners, 12 Pack",1/1,2.0,"Even though made for Boda Dome they do not fit. Bags are rectangular not round, just reach the edges of liter box.Once you actually put liter in,bags pull away from the sides and cats bury pieces under liter. Bags are also very thin, only last a day or two before being useless. Better to buy any brand extra large, heavy duty bags or go without bags at all."

Two other reviews said that it was too snug and that it didn't block out all light. OK, well, I have a large head and found it very comfortable to wear over a 7 hour flight. Also, no...you can see a tiny bit of light. It seems a bit too much to expect that a sleep mask will perfectly contour to your nose and block out all light. I love this and would recommend it."

My mother has Cdif so they have to use these to prevent spreading the disease.Price is great too considering the local company wants $1 ea! I couldn't find them for less anywhere else on the net either.5 Stars because they are good for what they are made for just be aware that they are NOT for all fluids etc."
4451,Panasonic Digital Power D Size Alkaline Batteries - 4 Pack,0/0,3.0,"There isn't much to say about batteries aside from whether they work or they don't.I don't keep enough logs to know how often I'm using these for the purposes I put them to (XBox Controller Batteries, TV Remotes, etc) but they appear to function as intended.To be honest though these batteries seem a bit overpriced for what I'd normally pay. For $9.28 (what they're at right now) I'd think I should get a few more since other vendors ask about that for 16 batteries. Unless this dropped to around $6 I wouldn't even consider it and that still seems like a lot for what you're getting.I'd avoid this and go for a better value."

4457,"Dove Pink Beauty Bar, 8 Count",3/3,3.0,"I can't believe that I'm writing a review about a bar of soap, but here goes. I have very dry skin and also have hard water in my house. The only solution to my dry skin is to either apply a greasy lotion several times a day, or use Dove soap. Since I hate using lotions, the Dove soap became my only option. Sure enough, the Dove soap effectively moisturizes my skin, so it is no longer dry and cracked. The reason why I'm only rating it 3 stars, is because the soap doesn't last long at all. Between my wife and me, we go through an entire bar in three days, sometimes two days if we exercise and take two showers a day. If you're a magician, you might want to use this soap in your disappearing magic act. In that case, it would be more cost effective than a rabbit. But for personal use, I consider the price unreasonable for the disappearing act it does in the shower. Dove used to come in 5 ounce bars, than it was reduced to 4.5 ounce bars, now it's down to just 4 ounces. At the rate it's going, I'll need to wear glasses in the shower just to find it."

I now keep one at the bottom of the bed and one at the top as a precaution. In the rare event of an accident, I can quickly remove the soiled one and use the second one instead. These don't hook to the sides of the bed, but just lay on top. For a twin bed it fits the exact width and slightly draps over the sides."
4460,Lentek 6-Day Automatic Pet Dish,0/0,4.0,"Great for my cat that can't pace himself when eating. Also, great for if I'm gone overnight for two nights. The downside, it's kind of difficult to take apart to refill the dish unless you sit there and push the button to move it ahead (then the cat thinks it's feeding time and is super confused)."
4461,Autumn Bright Bouquet,0/0,3.0,"The flowers were very well packaged, and lasted a long time. The person receiving the gift was very happy.The one problem is that the roses did not last. They wilted almost immediately.I would definitely order again, but only those bouquets without roses."

It's a keeper that I will be using for a long time.

Now, the battery won't hold a charge for more than about a day.It only took a couple months for me to notice that the battery life was getting worse. A few months later, and it had gotten ridiculous. Adding to the problem"

Still works as a bowl, but I have to carry it."

4474,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,1/1,5.0,"I've been using a cheaper, butterfly-style safety razor for a few years. It finally broke, so I bought this. I get a much better shave with this. The butterfly style razors can bend the blade at weird angles. This razor keeps the blade angle consistent, giving a closer shave and avoiding cuts.If you're new to safety razors, you may cut yourself at first. That's normal. Once you adjust to the different technique, you'll have less skin irritation."

4476,Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690 Electronic Thermometer #01690-200,5/5,1.0,"I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers. We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues. I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away!!! Shipping was GREAT! I opened it, read the manual and then took her temp ( knowing she was hot ) it said 98.8. I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4, THIS IS AN ISSUE! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening, knowing she was still running a fever. It read 99.9, old thermometer read 100.9. YET AGAIN AN ISSUE!!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps. My husband decided to call the company. No answer, no answering service. He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer, unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as ""New"" through this company. THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE!!!! These thermometers may be PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND USED AND BEING SOLD AS ""NEW""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will update this as soon as a I speak with a supervisor tomorrow!"

4483,Nature's Way Flax Oil,0/0,5.0,"I had gastric bypass almost 2 years ago and as part of the protocol I'm supposed to have a protein shake every morning. A friend of mine recommended that I take Flax Seed Oil and/or Fish Oil due to the many health benefits it provides. So I thought I would start adding it to my shakes every morning.It looked a little funny at first. You're supposed to shake up the bottle real good and then squirt the oil out through the ""valve"" bottle opening. It actually looks pretty gross. It's got bits of seed in there but it's explained on the bottle that it's expected. So I went with it.To my surprise it actually enhanced the flavor of the shake and made it noticeably smoother! I think this is an excellent product and with this very reasonable price I'm happy that I can do a little something more to make myself more healthy with very little added daily cost.For those who are interested and need a protein shake every day, here is my very delicious recipe (Note, this isn't exactly low calorie!):1.5 (12 oz) water2 scoops ofOptimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound2-3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter1 Banana1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil1-2 Cups of Ice (depending on how ""shakey"" you want it to be)Blend until smooth*** UPDATE *** Just got my second bottle of this stuff. Still love it. Packaging was better this time (first time cap was broken)."

4488,"Sugar Twin, 7.1300-Ounce (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I really loved this product. It was just what it was advertised as. Really great! :) So happy it was worth it.
4489,"NATURE'S WAY, Valerian Root - 180 caps",0/0,3.0,"It's supposed to help you to sleep. Really? This supplement did absolutely nothing to help me to sleep. Maybe it helps others, but not me."
4490,"Viralys (L-Lysine) Oral Gel For Cats, 5 oz",2/2,5.0,"Much improvement in my cats herpes symptoms. Keeping symptoms down became very important after the herpes caused my cat to develop an ulser in his eye that would not go away. Then he needed $2K of surgery to fix the ulcer. Vet warned about keeping symptoms down. His surgery was a complete success, but if symptoms start getting mucuse sneezes I give 2 doses for one or two days, and so far so good. I just cringed at giving that huge Llysene pill, and thought I was going to choke him. Great, great product."
4491,"Oster Professional Pet Grooming Undercoat Rake, 18 Teeth Wide, Coarse",2/2,5.0,"If you have a dog like mine (Akita-Chow mix) that has a heavy coat of fur and a thick undercoat, you'll need three products"
4492,Citric Acid,0/1,1.0,"Was great, price was good and welcome to the free-market economy - now trying to add more words to finish this review."
4493,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,4.0,"I got this to help down out the sounds I anticipated would come from an adjoining office that was in the process of being occupied. However, that office did not get occupied. I have tried it out, though, and it is sitting next to my printer against the waiting-to-offend wall separating me from the other office just waiting to do it's job.Basically, this think has two fans inside it that create a noise that is supposed to down out other noises. It doesn't actually &#34;void&#34; the other noises. It just sort of overpowers them without being too annoying.Will it work for you? I don't know. Try it, and see. If it doesn't, send it back."
4494,Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Battery Powered Jet Engine With Thomas,0/0,5.0,"My son had wanted this one for a long time--we love this episode--but I took a little while to look around for a reasonably priced one, and I found it on amazon, like usual. Very durable and we like Thomas' surprised expression."
4495,Johnson & Johnson Johnsons Clean & Clear Persa-Gel,0/0,2.0,"I don't know why I keep buying this, it does not work for me. As far as I can tell, it's M.O. is to dry out the pimple and all surrounding skin until it's so dry it just breaks off like chalk. I don't know, but it's really uncomfortable. For me it is a cycle of putting on cream, about 15 minutes later the spot feels tight and itchy, so I have to wash it off, then I go back and put more on, etc. etc. The Neutrogena stuff is better and in the same price range. Clean & Clear makes some great face wash, but this one is a fail."
4496,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,1/1,4.0,"This dog bed fits perfectly in my dog's crate; it's actually what coaxed her to use the crate during crate training. It has worn out a bit after multiple washings, but it's probably my own fault in that I usually toss it in with other bedding on a not-so-gentle cycle."
4497,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,0/0,5.0,I bought it for my son for his classes in doctor of physical therapy. He told me it that the stethoscope worked very well. He liked it and if he did I would recommend it.
4498,Avatrol Alternative Hemorrhoid Treatment - 1 Month Supply Avatrol Capsules,1/1,3.0,"Not sure this product is helping me in any way. I prefer ointments for the hemorrhoids. They seem to be more effective than oral capsules.I'll keep taking it, but I don't believe in the miracle much!"
4499,Trend Lab Window Valance,0/0,5.0,"This valance compliments my daughters nursery wonderfully. We have the Maya crib bedding set and matching valance and it looks wonderful! I washed the valance before hanging it up, let it air dry, then hung it up and it looks great!"
4500,"Yeowww! Catnip Toy, Yellow Banana",0/0,4.0,"Cats mauled it, but they slobbered on it so much it is now a nasty green color. It is pretty durable, I can see teeth marks on it, but no holes. If one of them passes by he might sniff at it and maybe bat it around a little, but nothing like when it first arrived."
4501,Woods of Windsor Lily Of The Valley Dusting Powder,0/0,5.0,This arrived quickly and the packaging is very pretty. The smell is exactly like lily of the valley. I would get this again.
4502,Hastings English World Globe,2/2,4.0,"I had been searching the internet and local stores for a decent globe for under $100 (I had no idea globes were so expensive). It seemed that all the globes were flimsy and cheaply made but still cost upwards of $150! I found this one and the reviews seemed promising. I must say that I am happy the globe feels so sturdy and has some weight to it! Though I am disappointed that not all the lines meet where they are suppose to.For now, it will do."
4503,Terre D'Hermes by Hermes for Men,0/0,5.0,I had a magazine sample of this cologne and with 1 sniff I was hooked!A great gift for the Man in your life!!!
4504,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,4.0,"This is a great diaper for daytime. But, lately my baby has been leaking at night.I tried a bigger size and that didn't work.My little boy sleeps on his one side and now I have to switch him from side to side during the night to avoid leaks.I think I am going to try one of the nighttime brands and see how that goes."
4505,Compound W Compound W Wart Remover Fast-Acting Gel,1/1,5.0,"Works fast and sticks well. I'll agree with the other posters who suggested using a toothpick to get the gel in the right spot. Once it's there, it sticks and dries quickly. Just a warning"
4506,Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush,0/2,1.0,Ordered this brush because of price and reviews. Received a cheap knockoff made in China. The brush points are very sharp and hurts to brush my head.
4507,Pet Gear Easy Step III,0/0,5.0,This works for my 12 year old 15 lb cat. She didn't need any coaxing to use. Assembling was easy enough.
4508,"Pair of Thermoskin Wrist Brace, Hand Brace, Carpal Tunnel Brace with Dorsal Stay, Right and Left",0/0,5.0,I like these better than the last ones I had because they have a metal bar on top and bottom. i wear them to bed and my arms are well rested by morning.
4509,Plan Toy Doll House Fun Toys Set,0/0,5.0,"Good dollhouse accessory! The bicycle, especially, gets a lot of use. Gives the little dolls their own toys so kids can play with the dolls the way they play."
4510,Melissa & Doug Giraffe Plush,0/0,5.0,This is a XMAS gift for my 2 year old nephew. He love giraffes. We are so excited to give it to him. It is even taller than expected.
4511,Dermalogica Age Smart Multivitamin Power Firm 0.5oz,1/2,1.0,I got Contract Dermatitis from this product. Anyone with allergies should check with their dr. before using. I wound at the eye dr. after using it for 2 months.
4512,Slingshot Flying Pig With Oink Sound,0/0,5.0,These are fun and hilarious toys. Great for the kids. They love to shoot each other with their different animals. We have four different ones!
4513,WHITE DIAMONDS by Elizabeth Taylor For women EDT SPRAY 1 OZ(Fragrance - Fragrances),0/0,5.0,Cuando tengan ofertas me envian mensajes de todos los productos por favor y otros perfumes similares a este recomendaciones para solicitarlos
4514,OSCAR For Women By OSCAR DE LA RENTA Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,This is my very favorite. The price was the lowest I ever paid. What a bargain! I will order again.
4515,Elasto-gel Cervical Collar CC102B,0/0,4.0,Took awile to learn exact microwave time but I like it now. Takes less microwave time if not completely cold.
4516,Jack Black Face Buff Energizing Scrub,0/0,5.0,"I really love this stuff. I have been using it for a little less than a year now, and it is the best face scrub I have ever used. I wasn't sure if I would be able to use it every day since it is on the rough side, but I do and my skin is always so smooth after I use it. It's great as a pre-shave treatment and a daily face wash!"
4517,CHAMPION Neoprene Elbow Strap with Pressure Pad,0/0,4.0,"I used this for the first time at CrossFit last night, and it worked perfectly! We did a lot of lifting, running & squats and I was sweating like crazy, and THE BAND STAYED IN PLACE! That was a problem I've had with other straps of this type, but this one did the job and didn't slide down my arm when I did a tough workout. Highly recommend!"
4518,Gumballs Green Apple (2 pounds),0/0,5.0,"I got just what I was hoping for, green apple gumballs! The flavor lasts about the same as it does with any other gumball, and the kids love them. I would recommend them to anyone."
4519,"Suave Cocoa Butter Shea Body Lotion Unisex Body, 18 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"Normally I only buy fragrance free products since the smell of synthetic perfumes makes me sick. As a moisturizer it feels great on my skin, better than most other products I have used in the past. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and does not leave me with a sticky feeling. However, the smell of cocoa from this lotion lingers all day which those soulless chocolate haters will not be a fan of. As someone who does love the smell of cocoa this product is win-win for me. It keeps my skin from drying out while being aromatherapeutic."
4520,"HEAVY DUTY 22"" TRANSPORT WHEELCHAIR",0/0,4.0,"I own a Non-Emergency Medical Transportation company... I have purchased 6 of these chairs and they are great!!! We use them hard core for day-in day-out commercial transport!!! They can handle the weight, fit on a standard lift platform, and hold up well.BUTAnd this is my only but, unscrew the little metal cylinder that locks against the wheel, put some threadlocker on it... and screw it back on... then you have a darn near zero maintenance chair!"
4521,"Dare Cookies, Maple Leaf Creme, 12.3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Wish this product was available in our grocery stores. The icing is especially good, and makes this a stand-out sandwich cookie."
4522,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,5.0,"I have a small dog and am adamant about dogs (I've had them all my 50 years of life) using ONE area to go potty in. I hate having a yard with little gift bombs and yellow spots.I purchased a fake grass, which is like real grass - see my other review- from Amazon and it works for what I want. I do not have the door attached as I want him to go in and out at will. ;)If you are using this as a pen, then I would suggest it for a small to extra small dog or rabbit. It's pretty sturdy, my 10 pounder didn't shove it over, although he tried."
4523,Percogesic Percogesic Fast Acting Extra Strength Pain Relief Caplets,0/0,2.0,"It's a rotten deal that they have taken out the one element that made it great and useful to many of us.No they put benadryl in in it, rather than phenyltoloxamine citrate. It's all such a scam for the drug companies benefit not the consumer."
4524,Andis Small Pet Clipper Combs 9 Piece Set model #12860,1/1,5.0,these clipper combs have helped me tremendously as I was learning to groom my yorkies.......now that I am more familiar with the art I am purchasing some extra blades and will probably not need the combs as much.......but I highly recommend these. Excellent for helping the beginner to not accidentally cut your dog's skin as the blade is not so close.
4525,Sleigh Style Changing Table,0/0,4.0,"I really like this. I can fit 6 of those fabric containers in it. I ended up choosing three on bottom and one on top and then putting the wipes on the top shelf along with &#34;some&#34; clothes for oopsies.I did feel the pad was very flat, only about an inch thick or so. I ended up getting a summer contour pad and placed it on top."
4526,TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Mohawk Gel for Spiking and Ultimate Hold Hair Styling Creams,0/0,5.0,My boys all wear spiked hair. This stuff is awesome for holding up hair that wants to lay flat! awesome stuff!
4527,"5 Second Brush On Nail Glue, 54006, IBD / Nail Treatments",0/0,5.0,Easy to use. Brush is the right size. Keeps the nails strong while securing the silk wrap fabric. Great product
4528,Paris Hilton Fragrances - Just Me Women Spray,0/0,4.0,"The Just Me is a fresh and pleasant aroma, is also very affordable relative to other fragrances. Liked it better than the other two most expensive perfume to buy"
4529,Jar of Glow Stars,0/0,4.0,"Trying to get the little one to sleep with the lights off , this is a great way to work them to. Like the product . The sticky stuff to hold them aren't that great."
4530,"Navitas Naturals Goji Berries, 16-Ounce Pouches",0/0,4.0,"These last a long time. I use the special blender for grinding these lil-fellers and mix flax seed to get a nice bulk additive for my juicing beverages. Two teaspoons in the juicer with fruits and green veggies, a bit of water; and you have a great fixer-upper for the day ahead."
4531,Fisher-Price Bubble Mower,0/0,5.0,bought for my nephew- he loves it. the only things is it is noisy and can get on his mom's nerves sometimes!
4532,Havana Cologne by Aramis for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,Great scent. Discontinued for a long time. Still have some in the older nicer blue bottle. I will buy this again.
4533,Vitamin E Cream 28000 IU,0/0,5.0,"This is a basic, heavier cream. I haven't noticed any major differences in my skin, but I've only been using it for about a month now. Don't get me wrong - it's not awful - very rich and emollient in fact, I'm just waiting see some improvements to some minor expression lines. Takes care of dryness no problem though!"
4534,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,3.0,"The color wasn't exactly like the picture. Its more matte, dull, and a bit darker. I was looking for a lighter shade of this color. My roommate and I bought the same stethoscope with the same color title, but from different sources and for some reason hers looks exactly like the picture and mine didnt. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars.Other than that it's great. Littmanns are the best. It comes with a second pair of ear pieces that are much better at tuning out extra noises and hearing what you intended to hear."
4535,C.E.T. 0.12% Chlorhexidine Cats & Dogs Mouth Rinse 8 oz,0/0,5.0,We have 4 cats and 2 of them have stinky breathe. This product really works well. Make sure to use it daily and you will be very happy with the results.
4536,ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,0/0,3.0,"Earlier in the year we received a few shipments of the Zico coconut water because we loved it! Then suddenly, the chocolate was not available anywhere. I sent an email to the company asking what had happened and no reply. Then a few months later, it is back on the shelves. We were so happy! I got a new bottle and brought it home to compare it to the old bottle. This is not the same product that they first sold. The new product tastes good but the old one was SO much better. My husband and I tasted both and agreed that we liked the old one more. I have one bottle of each and will put the new nutrition facts first/ then the old so you can see how the new one doesn't have as many vitamins and minerals as the old. All in grams or mg.Calories 120/110fat 2/2sodium 140/160Carbs 24/23sugars 20/18protein 1/1vitamin A 0/8calcium 4/6phosphorus 2/7iron 6/13magnesium 10/16potassium 600/680So, as you can see, some of the numbers are close but they did change. The new one is still good but I don't think we will be buying it very often. The old one had more of a chocolate milk taste (less sugar, more taste!) and since I don't drink dairy, I loved it. The new one has a slight aftertaste of coconut water so if you don't mind that, I am sure you will like it."
4537,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,I had a Hot Tools curling iron for about 4-5 years before it broke. I settled for a ceramic one from Sally's and it didn't work half as good. This particular one squeaks when I open the clamp but other than that I am very satisfied.
4538,"7 Day x 5 Large Capacity Pill Box. Weekly Pill Box Organizer System for Medications, Supplements, and Vitamins. Canvas Travel Bag included.",0/0,5.0,This product was just what the doctor ordered. My Father has quite a bit of medicine to take at varying times throughout the day. Having 5 compartments for each day worked out perfectly. I am able to go once per week and fill the pill box with all of his meds for the whole week.The days of the week are clearly marked at the top and the carrying case is excellent when we have to go some where. The individual compartments are large enough to hard quite a few pills and easy to open and close.The only suggestion I make would be if the manufacturer would provide clear tabs to use on the front of the box to denote different times of the day. I have to use post-it tape to create my own labels.I would recommend this to anyone who has lots of meds to take at varying times throughout the day.
4539,Baby Gund My First Sports Bag,0/0,3.0,"These really are meant to be the baby's first sports bag. Like popped the kid right out and can play with these toys. The idea is cute and each ball makes a different noise, but I was very disappointed with its size. I would not buy this again."
4540,Triominos In Tin,0/0,5.0,This game is fantastic if you never played you should. The tin it comes in is nice so you don't have to worry about torn boxes. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games.
4541,"Jennies Macaroon, Dutch Chocolate, 2-Ounce Individually Wrapped Packages (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"Rich, dense chocolate macaroon, which is also gluten-free. Like the individual package for ease in carrying in pocket or purse. Wonderful cookie."
4542,Ecco Bella Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil,0/0,5.0,"Very black beautiful color that even comes with its own little built on mirror! Please note, however, that it is not waterproof, and tears will bring it down!"
4543,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,0/0,5.0,"Babies don't need much, but this toy is a must have at any age they love the blocks then eventually they will understand putting them in the shapes holes."
4544,Elasto-gel Cervical Collar CC102B,1/1,5.0,was a gift for my daughter who is totally amazed by how great it works... it gives much needed relief... highly recommend it...
4545,Radio Flyer Umbrella Accessory,0/0,3.0,It could have been a little longer. It works for what its made for i guess. not a bad buy.
4546,"Nutty Gray Squirrel 6.5"" by Aurora",0/0,3.0,This 6.5&#34; squirrel seems a little smaller than I expected even with the size description but it will make a great stocking stuffer item.
4547,Spill and Spell Game,0/0,5.0,This is a great game that requires short interval time investment. Fun for any level speller. We've created our own harder rules.
4548,"Paprika - Ground, Hungarian, 1 lbs",0/0,1.0,"WARNING DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE.I ORDERED THE ABOVE PICTURED ITEM BY FRONTIER NATURAL IN THE FOIL BAG. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS SOMETHING IN A PLASTIC BOTTLE MARKED OTTO'S.I'M SORRY THIS SMACKS OF FRAUD......."
4549,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"It has a constant and kind of gently mechanical wind sound. Nothing rhythmic, just a &#34;running machine&#34; sound. Baby one couldnt sleep without it, baby two, well, she doesnt sleep well anyway but Im sure she would sleep worse without the white noise!"
4550,PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet Barrier,0/0,5.0,great product. worked on my cat. would recommend to anyone in need of something to control cats from getting on things they shouldnt.
4551,"Precision Pet ProConcepts Vehicle Pet Barrier, Universal Fit, Black",0/0,4.0,This does it's job. Keeps the dog in the back of the SUV and is a PERFECT fit for our Mazda CX-9. My only complaint is that it is time consuming to put in/out. I guess it's not really am issue since we rarely use the 3rd row of seats anyway!
4552,Pink Laptop Buddha Board,0/0,4.0,I think these are a little harder to use for small children thank the small ones- they are large too
4553,Alex Toys Super Cooking Set,0/0,2.0,"Bought these as a gift for my daugher for Christmas and will be sending this back. She's only 2 and a half but these are even too small for her. They would look like miniature pots and pans in her kidkraft kitchen. Save yourself the time, effort and money and get something else!"
4554,Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments,0/0,4.0,"Tried this guy the day it was shipped to me. Cut very smooth, never felt any catching or pulling of hairs. Everything feels pretty sturdy and as a guy I very much enjoy the way it looks and feels. Only cons are no case to put it in, and could use a few more attachment size varieties. If you are doing your own hair at home and looking to upgrade what you are currently using because you are getting snagged a lot, stop looking and get these."
4555,Rachels Polish Remover 16 oz. Pure Acetone (Clear),0/0,5.0,"I used to wonder how the girls in the nail salon get rid of all the nail polish on finger and toe nails so quickly. It took me forever to do it at home with the removers you get at the drugstore. Here's the answer, ACETONE! A little goes a long way so the product is well worth the price! It's &#34;economy size&#34; so you get a big bottle.I don't go to the nail salon anymore, I have an appointment with myself every Sunday, Mani + Pedi! Done in 30 minutes!With the right products and a little know how, no problem and saves me a ton of money!!"
4556,"Duro-Med Polyfoam Wheelchair Cushion, Poly/Cotton Cover, Navy",0/0,5.0,"You know you work in an office when you're buying a wheelchair seat cushion to keep you 29 year old tailbone from going all Les Mis on you and revolting against your daily sitting. Thin, but comfy. Crushes pretty easily under my fat frame, but still takes the edge off."
4557,APTERA IMPORTS INC Olive Oil Soap,0/0,3.0,"I'm impressed with how well this works as both a shampoo and body wash. However, I've noticed my face being all red getting out of the shower, and feeling a bit sore... I think the salt in the soap basically strips away the oils/leaves my face raw/dry. Possibly related, I have tried to use a saline nasal spray to help with sinus issues, and after a few weeks had to stop that as it was making me sneeze. My body probably doesn't like salt."
4558,Accu-chek Multiclix Lancets By Roche Diagnostics - 102 Each,0/0,4.0,these lancets are just what they are supposed to be. priced right and functional. i will purchase more when i need them
4559,Webkinz Tree Frog,0/0,5.0,"This is a super cute tree frog, soft and snuggly with huge feet. The digital interactive piece makes it extra fun for kids."
4560,Ortho Bed Wedge,1/1,5.0,I purchased this product after a back injury which eventually resulted in surgery and soon found this wedge to be an amazing relief. It took stress and pressure off by back and allowed me to actually sleep through the night. There are times when I turn it around and put the sloping angle toward my feet -- it's just a slight change in the position of your legs. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has back stiffness or pain.
4561,Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum,0/0,5.0,"I'm still getting used to this product. However, it goes on smoothly and adds much needed moisture to dry skin."
4562,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/0,1.0,"These arrived in a Duracell package and seem fine. I trust Duracell, which is why I purchased them. My complaint is they were marked as $11.50 for 8 C batteries and when I checked out a couple hours later, they were almost $12. I checked them the day after I purchased and yep, they're $11.50 again. Yes, it's just 50 cents, but it's over 4% mark-up and I notice prices do change after I add them to my cart, but not until at least a day's passed! Buyers beware!"
4563,"Marshalls Creek Spices Oregano Seasoning, 5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,I am using this spice to make Italian style pasta sauce. This is just what I wanted and it was shipped very quickly.
4564,"Now Foods, Calcium Ascorbate Powder",0/0,5.0,"I used to buy sliced, bagged apples at a premium price because they didn't brown. So I read the ingredients to see what they were using to keep the apples fresh. The bag contained nothing but apples and Calcium Ascorbate. I fill a shallow glass pan 1/2 full of water, add a tablespoon or so of this powder, let it disolve, slice my apples, and soak for about 1/2 hr to 1 hr. Might work after 15 min, who knows. Anyway, apples stay fresh and do not brown. I have kept them in my fridge for over a week and they are still fresh."
4565,Topix Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads 20% 60 Pads,0/0,1.0,I have been using a 10% Glycolic Pad from another company. I've been very happy with that product but felt I needed something a little stronger.I purchased the Glycolix Treatment Pads in 15% and 20%. I figured I would build a tolerance to the 15 so I also purchased the 20.The first time I used the 15% I felt nothing. The next day I tried the 20% pads. I felt a very slight tingling sensation. Hardly noticeable.Tonight I tried my old 10% pads. I can still feel like they are working. They give that burn / tingling feeling.I'm not sure if you have to feel that tingling for the product to be working or not. I would think yes.Someone else wrote that these pads are a knock off of the real thing.At this point I can not recommend this product. I will still continue to try this product since I already have it.If my opinion changes I will post it here.
4566,"Harbinger 233 5"" Firm Fit Foam Core 3"" Strap Belt (Black)",0/0,5.0,"Finally, a belt that is comfortable, and can support my back with the weight I push around!!!Thank you Harbinger!!RM Leal"
4567,"Learning Resources Jumbo Farm Animals, Set of 7",0/0,5.0,"My 15 month old loves these. They are the perfect size. They aren't like the small farm animals that comes with most packages. They are fairly big, and she cannot hurt them. I stuff a few in our bag on the way out the door, and she can easily play with them in the car. Great thing.... they don't get lost between seats or amongst our mess."
4568,Zum Glow Tin Frankincense & Myrrh-7 oz.,0/1,1.0,"This product is advertised as 100% essential oil. When I opened the lid it smelled nothing like frankincense or myrrh. I turned it over to see the words ""fragrance oil"". This means they are using toxic fragrance oils and erroneously marketing their product as natural."
4569,Mary Kay Timewise Age Fighting Moisturizer Normal/Dry,0/0,5.0,Very good product by Mary Kay. I bought this as a gift for an aunt. I can tell she's very happy with the product. She loves Mary Kay and states that all her products are of the highest quality. Highly recommended.
4570,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/1,1.0,"I am very disappointed that Duracell batteries, before their expiration date, leaked and damaged the pickup on my Taylor electric/acoustic guitar. I was a loyal Duracell user for many years. I always thought they were a cut above the others. But, I will never buy another Duracell battery for any reason. I will try another American brand. I am not ready to jump to the cheap Chinese batteries."
4571,O'Keefes Creme,0/2,2.0,Have seen this at a local store and a friend swears by it.It is VERY long lasting but I just don't see the big deal. One small jar goes a long way and maybe that justifies the expense?
4572,BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original,0/0,2.0,"This carrier puts all the baby's weight on your shoulders and upper back. I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine."
4573,Clean + Easy Deluxe Electrolysis Home (For Coarse Hair),0/0,5.0,you need a lot of love and patience but it does the job...After two to three slowly decreasing regrowth it finally has cleared everything to a beautiful bikini...
4574,Core Jeanie Rub Massager,1/1,5.0,This product works just as it is described. Works great for lower & upper back as well as cervical massaging using the edge of the pad.
4575,Comfort Products 60-2910 Ten Motor Massage Cushion with Heat,0/0,5.0,This massage cushion is the best that I have ever owned. This was purchased for my car because I drive a lot with my job.I have two others both made by Homedics that do not work nearly as well and I will replace them soon. I am really impressed with Comfort Products and I recommend this inexpensive model to anyone looking for a quality message cushion.
4576,Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,0/0,4.0,The Wahl Groomsman does it's job. It stays charged for a long time. The ability to use it while plugged in is a huge feature other trimmers miss. It is sturdy and will last a long time. I gave 4 stars because the first one arrived DOA. Amazon quickly replaced it.
4577,La Roche-Posay Hydraphase Eyes Hydrating Treatment Gel (15ml) 0.5 Fluid Ounce,2/2,5.0,"i am someone who is really into skin and beauty care products so i have tried A LOT of them, mainly the high end ones. i was asking my (very good) dermatologist what she recommended i use to treat any expression lines (i am in my thirties and i dont really have wrinkles). She said"
4578,"Lipton Black Tea, Loose, 1/2 pound Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Lipton Loose Tea has the best flavor, bar none. I get compliments on my iced tea every time I serve it, which is constantly. My husband switched over to this after drinking lemonade for years. He didn't like tea of any kind in earlier years. Now, if I don't pour him a glass when I have one, he takes mine. This is the truth. I use untreated water, and I think that makes a big difference in that I can get the full flavor from Lipton. Wonderful product. Just don't raise the price, and I'll keep buying."
4579,"Traditional Medicinals Organic Smooth Move, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",1/2,5.0,A few years back my wife had an operation. Nothing the hospital tried worked and finally the Dr. allowed her to use the tea and the next day she was regular. It really works
4580,Natures Gate Organic Fruit Therapy Deodorants,0/0,4.0,"This doesn't quite get a 5 as she finds it doesn't help a lot after track practice, she doesn' react to it as she does many, it doesn't give me headaches the way chemically perfumed things she uses does, and she likes the smell."
4581,25 Ultra Pro 9 Pocket Page Protectors Fits 3-Ring Binder for Baseball and Other Sports Cards!,0/0,5.0,I know the grandson will love these so they can protect the cards that seem to have the most points.
4582,Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller,0/0,5.0,Bought this stroller 3 years ago to use with the matching car seat and to lug around my baby and older daughter. My oldest just recently got too big for it so I got rid of it but it was still in wonderful condition. We used it a few times a week and it held up great. Cute design.
4583,Exo Terra Hygrometer,0/0,5.0,"I've bougth to test it at home.Very good visual colors and quite reliable.I don't have any lizard yet, but next year I'll need it to control my room humidity for my new aquariums.I'd recommend for everyone."
4584,Laxatone 2.5 oz,0/0,3.0,"The product does exactly what it says, but getting it into the cat is the issue you'll probably face. It's smells like maple syrup and my cat liked the taste, but had too much trouble eating it with dry food. It's so sticky it will clump all the food into a ball. This made it far too difficult to chew on and it got rolled around until it hardened. A few drops always wound up on the bottom of the bowl and my cat disapproved. The bottle is also a constant problem, because there's always some of this glue-like paste that runs into and around the cap. Every time you unscrew the top you'll have a mess on your hands and will eventually need to scrape the stuff off. I didn't need to use much of it so the bottle might not bother other people. This product might not cause problems with other cats, but mine always looked like she was trying to chew peanut butter and learned to avoid it."
4585,Melissa & Doug Stop Sign (Vehicles) Jumbo Puzzle,0/0,5.0,I bought this puzzle for my 9month old son last year for Christmas and he still plays with them this current year. The colors are great and I love the simple shapes.
4586,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,"I purchased the gray one because it went best with my carrier, but various colors are available. I have a diabetic cat who requires frequent vet visits and this bed has made those visits less stressful for her (and me). It fits securely in the carrier, avoiding the shifting and sliding while still affording the protection and security of the hard carrier. Don't hesitate if you are thinking about this for a carrier bed!"
4587,Melissa & Doug Rainbow Scratch Art Boards,0/0,5.0,"this is going to be great, got it as a stocking stuffer, my cousin is going to love it so much!"
4588,"Mickey Mouse Cake Decorations - MICKEY MOUSE BOLD EDIBLE Candy Confetti Sprinkles for Cakes, Cupcakes & Cookies",0/0,5.0,Nice and bright. we bought these because we are huge Disney/Mickey fans. We even put them on out cookies and they made it though baking without melting.
4589,"Dimensions Paint By Number Kit (14"" X 11"") - in your choice of designs",0/0,5.0,"This was an easy kit and it made a very attractive painting. I was just going to paint this for fun, but the painting looked so nice that I ended up framing it and hanging it in the bedroom. The light in the painting is lovely. Dog lovers would really enjoy this."
4590,PROVALE Cup,0/0,5.0,Very useful with individuals I work with who are developmentally disabled. Paces drinking; thereby reducing choking risk. Will purchase again
4591,Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Orange Sencha Tea,0/0,5.0,"My local grocery doesn't carry the organic orange sencha green tea, but does carry several other flavors of Two Leaves and a Bud. If I want to order this flavor from my grocery, I have to purchase an entire case. The flavor is mild green tea with a light citrus blend. It's wonderful. I quit drinking coffee this year, and only drink green tea. I've tried several different varieties, but Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Orange Sencha Green Tea is still my favorite. Great price for a wonderful tea."
4592,"Celestial Seasonings Caffeine-Free Herb Tea with Roasted Chicory, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I used to love iced tea, but had to give up on it because of the caffeine. I stumbled across the reviews here and decided to try this Celestial Seasonings version, and it definitely lives up to all the positive reviews. The tea essence is probably what gives it the tea taste, and it can be brewed cold, which is a plus and makes it a handy replacement for those who like instant ice tea like Lipton's. I'll be buying this again!"
4593,Sesame Street Small Plush,0/0,5.0,This is a nice Plush and is as advertised. The hair is a bit longer than what is shown in the picture which s totally fine.
4594,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,4.0,My dog loved this toy. She played with it for the longest time before she was able to get one of the squirrels lose from the log.

4598,2013 Hammer Nutrition Complex Carbohydrate Energy Gel - 12-Pack,0/0,5.0,"I was kind of hesitant to order Hammer products from anywhere other than their website. Some of the photos on Amazon looked like old, previous labels. Happy to report, received product with new packaging and an expiration date as expected, in 2014. Awesome product for athletes."
4599,Kinesio Tex Tape,0/0,5.0,"This tape is one of the greatest inventions I've found for athletes who suffer from overuse injuries. Once applied, it is not even noticeable, yet makes a dramatic difference in healing. There are two versions of this tape, this and KT. Of the two, this tape sticks to the skin better. The disadvantage for those who want convenience is that it does not come in pre-cut lengths."
4600,Lab Series by Lab Series,0/0,5.0,"I recently started commuting to work on my bicycle. Needles to say, when I get to my office I need to wash my face and freshen up. These wipes do the work for me very well. I grab one wipe, pass it on my face, and it cleans up any sweat, dirt, and grime from my bike ride. Plus it takes the shine off my face and gives it a nice bright, clean, and matte look. Love these things."
4601,FHI Heat Platform with Nano Technology,0/0,4.0,Works well.
4602,SE Small Pill/ID Holder Keychain (Set of 6),1/1,5.0,"As I said, for the price these are simply amazing. Each one comes with a little clear plastic vial that can hold something the size of about 1 Tylenol gelcap. If you remove the plastic vial, you can easily fit 2. I carry two Tylenol gel-caps in 1 container, I wrap them with a bit of plastic wrap to keep them somewhat protected and so far this has worked great. I keep two of these canisters on my edc keychain, one I've managed (with some trial and error) a $20 bill (in the green one :]), and the medicine in the other. These do have some small metal shavings inside them, which is why I recommend using some type of plastic covering around any pills. If you over tighten them the little o-rings do have a habit of 'popping' out/off, however you can make the top screw on and stay rather tight by just being careful and few should have any problems with this.These are very light weight aluminum and the treading is ok for what they are. I have noticed that over time the paint does seem to chip off a bit, but not to the point of it being a big issue or enough to lose a star. I am very satisfied with these and I I would recommend these to anyone needing a little pill holder/emergency money holder/stash."
4603,"6"" Godzilla",0/0,5.0,the product looked real and very detailed. Could have been a little bigger. bought it for my Grandson who is 7 years old. He watches Godzill movies and realyy thought this was the real dealContruction is very durable and the deatails are life like. Would recomend this product to my friends.
4604,Window Washer & Squeegee,1/1,4.0,I am happy with this product so far. I cleaned my livinng room windows and it worked fine. Good product
4605,"Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",1/3,2.0,"This tea is odd. It has a deceptively fruity smell, but tastes like nothing with a vague hint of something mildly fruity. Labeling the tea a ""blueberry"" tea was pretty inaccurate, in my opinion. (There are much tastier and much more fragrant fruit teas available on the market!) If you let it oversteep, it gets bitter and acidic. Maybe I got a bad batch (of 6 boxes??), but every bag I had tasted like it was fairly old and maybe stale. I started getting in the habit of waiting for the tea to cool and gulping it back as fast as possible, because the taste bothered me so much.I also chose this tea because it says it gives you energy. Despite drinking multiple cups a day for a month, I felt absolutely no effect on my energy levels (compared to my normal drink choice of unflavored green tea from various brands). If you never drink any caffeine, maybe you'd feel an ""energy boosting"" effect, but that's unlikely if you're already a tea lover.I do not recommend this tea. The other Yogi teas I've tried are much higher quality.The only reason I gave my review two stars instead of one is because if anything, the teabags are high quality, as you would expect for such an expensive tea. (I've never had a bag fall apart--too bad I'm only drinking it because I hate throwing out tea!)"
4606,IRIS Airtight Pet Food Storage Container,0/0,5.0,"Nice locking capability. Keep food fresh with a nice seal. I also love that my dog can't (or hasn't yet) figured out how to open it. It's a decent latch. It holds 2 bags of 35lb food for me, but depending on the shape of your kibble, that might not be the case for you. The wheels have held up and the hinges are great. I have zero complaints!"
4607,HAPPY For Women By CLINIQUE Eau de Parfum Spray,0/1,1.0,This bottle of Clinique Happy smelled like alcohol. Clinque is the only fragrance I wear and this smells nothing like it. Highly disappointed.
4608,Melissa & Doug Vehicles Mini-Puzzle Pack,0/0,5.0,"My two year old is a big fan of all modes of transportation - planes, trains, cars, rescue vehicles and trucks. This puzzle has them all! He loves it."
4609,"3M Littmann Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope, Burgundy Tube, 28 inch, 2451",0/0,5.0,"Great quality,very fashionable and works great! My whole nursing lab got the same one as we loved each other's so much!"
4610,Presidor Wafer Rolls,0/0,4.0,these wafer rolls were very good if you like a very sweet taste.they would have gotten a rating of 5 if they were not so sweet.
4611,"Solaray - Children's Multi Chew Cherry, 120 chewable tablets",0/0,4.0,"Content wise, this is a good product! I'm very picky about what I give my kids and these vitamins meet my standards. (I'm no fan of feeding my kids vitamins that have artificial sweeteners or additives that have questionable research.) The kids liked them just fine the first 5-6 weeks, then started to comment that the taste was &#34;off.&#34; Despite a new bottle, the taste is still &#34;off&#34; and it's now becoming a struggle to get our youngest to eat them (we found two in the couch cushions!). When we first got them, I tasted one and thought they tasted odd, but the kids loved them. I guess the odd taste I noticed has built up over time for them. I'll buy them again, but not for a while. I'm looking for another brand to off set these.Again, content is great! - 5 stars, Taste is odd - 3 stars, total score - 4 stars."
4612,John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine Luminous Color Glaze-6.5 oz (192 ml),0/0,2.0,"I purchased this glaze to help cover up a few grays between colorings and to give me some overall shine. I already use the John Frieda foam colour (currently using light ash brown) and found this glaze while looking for another batch of permanent color. I though it might extend the time between colorings just a bit. I found the consistency of the glaze a little difficult to apply in the shower. I often found it sliding off my wet/damp hair before I could get it rubbed in. Since I was interested in covering grays, I started at my scalp and would then rub and comb the product down to the ends of my shoulder-blade-length hair. As mentioned by other reviewers - this stuff stains. That's the idea, right? But note that it stains skin as well as hair. It's difficult to rinse it all off the scalp without scrubbing it - which would remove it from the gray roots I'm trying to cover. And be sure to scrub, scrub, scrub your hands with some soap while you're waiting for the product to do its thing in your hair. (This stuff would make a great instant tan if you're going for a too-long-in-the-booth look.) Some days I rinse too well (or didn't leave it on long enough) and it doesn't look like I've even used the product. Other days I think this product adds a lovely shine. And some days if it doesn't get rinsed just right it just plain looks greasy. Feels like too much of a gamble to use this product on a regular basis.I would not recommend it for covering grays (even if only temporarily) because of the scalp staining issue. If you spend enough time perfecting your technique, it would probably provide a good shine to hair that just needs a little boost."
4613,"Radio Flyer 2700Z Pathfinder Wagon, Red",0/0,4.0,"Bought as a bday gift for my two year old twins. So very easy to put together, it took me 30 mins at the most. Its strudy and the kids loved it. The seats can fold down for a traditional wagon. I have even had my 4 yr old in there with her brother and sister! Its very easy to move as well. Even my 4 yr old had no issue pulling her brother and sister and turning it around.Great buy!"
4614,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,"The product quality has detiorated over the past one year. We have been using Pampers ever since my baby girl started using diapers. Of late, there has been several instances where the diaper does not hold up enough liquid as it used to, it wets the pants very often. I am unhappy with the shipments coming from Amazon too, the carton packages are most damaged when it arrives. Does not make me feel safe although the diapers are protected with the plastic foil inside. The price point is good, which is the only positive aspect to mention."
4615,Hagen Crabworx Drinking Pool,0/0,5.0,"I bought two for my hermits and they work perfect, make it easy for the crabs to get in and out."
4616,Ty Beanie Babies - Canyon the Cougar,0/0,5.0,"Very nice facial features on this wild cat beanie baby. Regular soft material, not longer fur. Very cute and cuddly."
4617,Analog and Digital Talking Desk Clock,0/0,1.0,The small digital clock worked but the face clock didn't work. The second hand didn't move at all. You get what you pay for. The clock is cheap in all aspects. The company was good about accepting a return. Unfortuantely my blind friend will get her gift that I exchanged for after Christmas.
4618,Black by Kenneth Cole New York Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Amazing product, long lasting and gets even better by time.My wife keeps roaming around me when I am wearing this."

4621,PoochPad Pet Training Pad,0/0,5.0,"I got these in a 2-set before ever trying disposable pads and I'm so glad for that. Initially I felt they were costly, but learned they were definitely worth it. They're very good, and I got over a year use out of one, washing it in only water every 48-72hrs, washing until the water ran clear. (One 6lb dog in household) After 6 months I did add a teaspoon of detergent to the water because it became necessary, but before that, it wasnt. A good rinsing/wash was always enough. After the yr, I realized the product had lived up to its promise, because obviously it had survived hundreds of washings and still worked. It came to need replacing and I realized that because it would smell after washing and seemed to be a little less absorbant. Would recommend and will definitely buy again."
4622,K&H Lectro Kennel Heated Pad with Free Fleece Cover,0/0,5.0,"My dog doesn't like coming in the house. We moved to the midwest from SC. and wanted him to be warm in the winter. The lectro heating pad keeps his dog house warm and toasty on cold days. He loves it, and so do I. I would recommend this product to anyone with pets."
4623,PlasmaCar Red,0/0,5.0,Third one I have purchased for my grandkids. I keep them at my house because every other weekend I have three come to stay. There were fights over them so I just invested in the third one. Probably will have to get the fourth one a little later. Entertains them for hours up and down my long drive way.

4625,Yomega Kendama Star Catch (Colors May Vary),0/1,1.0,"I ordered two items, one green and one yellow. Was supposed to be two day shipping but took almost a week to arrive. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I will not order from this vendor again. It is to close to Christmas to return the items and my children would be disappointed if they open presents on Christmas to find they didn't receive the one item they asked for.Thank you and happy holidays"
4626,Energizer ECR2450 6 Batteries,0/0,5.0,Work fine. Came quickly. Nothing leaks. It's a set of batteries. Why are so many words need to review something as basic as batteries?

4628,Lil' Doll Cradle,0/0,4.0,"This is a cute lil' doll crib. My husband put it together. Its sturdy and is well made. However, I feel it is a little too narrow. You can't use a really hard doll that wont flex to fit in the crib. It works well with smaller dolls."
4629,Palmers Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E,0/0,4.0,"This cream was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I liked it because it was thick and creamy and kept my skin soft. It is a bit pricey, so I won't be buying again."
4630,American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Crib Bumper,0/0,5.0,"Nice pretty pink, soft, fits crib great! High recommend. Also bought the matching crib bed skirt - perfect combo! The solid color leaves me more open to decorating options."

4634,K&H 3093 Extreme Weather Kitty Pad with Fleece Cover,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful product that has eased our worries about providing warmth and shelter for a stray cat that has been coming around. We purchased this product along with the Kitty Tube. We placed the extreme weather kitty pad inside the kitty tube on top of the bed that comes with it. She moved right in and has been very comfortable. The pad stays at a very low, comfortable temperature. You do not have to worry about it over heating. When I first plugged it in inside our house, it seemed to get too warm, but it doesn't outside. It stays at a low temperature, then heats a bit more when the cat is on it. Our utility bill has not increased with the use of this product. Now we can sleep without worry that Miss Kitty is freezing outside without shelter. It is worth every penny and we are very satisfied with it's performance. Buy without worry and know that you are providing safe and comfortable shelter for your cat/cats outside."

4637,Rake Set,0/0,5.0,"Great for all dogs, big or small. I own a 80 lb lab and this was more than enough to handle several weeks of his droppings."
4638,"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,5.0,"The ideal sized package. Two sets of 4 batteries which go into my camera. Many times I have to change the batteries which shooting pictures because they do not last. I have not counted the number of shots that I have made with these, but I am still on the first set of 4! It is nice when manufacturers listen to their customers and realize that the items they make are for high energy consuming items. Next place I will put them will be in my remote keyboard, I will know that they will last a lot longer than others I have used in the past."
4639,Battat Take Apart 4X4,0/0,5.0,My wife and I bought this for our 3 year old grandson. Thought it would be a good father-son work on together toy. Turned out to be a wonderful uncle-nephew work on together toy. Our grandson moves from one project to another quickly but he spent an unusual bit of time with this toy when he first got it. We would recommend this toy to others with similar age children-grandchildren.
4640,"Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier, Large, Black",0/0,5.0,"I just love this carrier, I've had 2 before..They last, my cats just decided to use it for a bathroom, going to the vets..I would recommend this if you are looking for this type of carrier..Came right away & packaged just fine..5 stars from me.."
4641,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,5.0,"they are the perfect thickness and I love that they aren't all connected together for when you have only 1 free hand (and then all of a sudden end up with 10 wipes stuck together when you only need 1 or 2). we use them not just for changing diapers, but for wiping dirty fingers and faces after mealtime. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"
4642,Bruder Toys Man Garbage Truck Rear Loading Green,0/0,4.0,"It is big, it recycles, it stores other toys; buy this truck if your child cannot get enough of trucks, dumping things into other things, or feels a healthy protective instinct toward our trash outlays."
4643,Liquid Silk Liquid Silk,0/0,5.0,"There are a lot of lubes on the market, but there are drawbacks to most. Water-based lubes can be used with anything, but they dry up too fast. Silicone lube is great and stays slick forever, but can dissolve silicone toys, can be messy, and tends to be too thin and runny. Liquid Silk combines the best of both worlds to give a lube that won't get dry or tacky and is thicker and stays in place better."
4644,Hugo Boss Bottled (No. 6) Men EDT Splash 0.16oz Mini,0/0,3.0,I was disappointed because it was so small. I guess I should have known because it said 0.16. Just can't visualize that size. My own fault.

4648,"King Ghidorah 9"" Action Figure (Japan Godzilla Import)",0/0,5.0,Got this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift. He's an avid Godzilla fan and is absolutely obsessed with the Godzilla franchise. I can't wait to see his face when he sees what ''Santa'' brought him this year. My only complaint is that it's more than just a tad pricey. These figures can normally be found in K-Mart for about $9.99 each.
4649,Classic Etch A Sketch Magic Screen,0/0,1.0,"After the initial nostalgia wears off, the frustration mounts as the lines refuse to remove themselves from the screen. Not at all like I remember mine as a child and both the young children who got these gave up on it after a very short while. Finally just threw them out. Guess the saying is true, they don't make them like they used to."

4652,Euphoria Perfume For Women by Calvin Klein,0/0,5.0,"Calvin Klein outdid himself with Euphoria. It's a clean, neat scent that can smell professional and decently homely at the same time. It can stay on your clothes delightfully for days. Spray it on your coats and blazers and step out in a better mood. I still find the scent refreshing after years of use. It's one of those classic perfumes to have, which work in all situations."
4653,"Lakota Black Spot Horse 10"" by Douglas Cuddle Toys",0/0,5.0,"Below is my original review; I loved the horse but hated the fact that the bridle/reins and saddle were sewn in & could not be removed. Actually they are only ""tacked"" in with a couple stitches which were hard to see as the threads were black on black. If you carefully use either a seam ripper or SMALL pair of scissors you can easily remove them. My daughter is having a lot of fun--both items are easy for her to remove & put back on (a huge plus for me!)This is a wonderful horse, size is exactly as described & has a wonderful expression and soft coat. The problem is with the saddle and bridle--they are NOT removable. Well, unless you cut them off. The saddle girth strap is sown into the horse's belly and the bridle is sown under the chin and throat. This is fine if the horse is just meant to sit on a shelf, but I bought this for my daughter to actually play with. When she's done with ""riding"", she likes to take everything off & brush the horse, just like a real one. I just know I'm going to end up cutting both saddle and bridle off which is really a shame--would have been very easy to just make them removable. I'm not sure if the bridle will be salvageable after cutting."

4662,Interlude by Frances Denney for Women Body Oils,0/0,3.0,"I am a little disappointed in these bottles. Somehow they do not smell the same as my older purchases. The color is lighter, but the smell is different also. I will still use it. Thanks"
4663,"Rainbow Light, Multivitamin",1/1,5.0,"It is easy to swallow and sometimes I chew them to be easy to my stomach.(It has an earthy flavor, so if you don't like them I wouldn't recommend doing it, though)I took it before, during and after pregnancy and nursing.I had a happy baby, so I think it did the job."
4664,Cat Sitter DVD,2/2,3.0,I couldnt get any of my cat's to even look at it. The videos were nicely done and the sound was also appropriate. I thought the cats should have been interested but they weren't. I tried sitting them right in front of the screen but they never noticed the gerbils or birds. The lower rating is only because it did not work for my group of cats. The quality of the video was excellent.

4667,NARS Cosmetics Lip Gloss,0/0,2.0,"This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad. My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss."

4670,Source Naturals L-Pyroglutamic Acid 1000mg,0/0,3.0,"I took .25 of tablet and slept really well with tons of very vivid dreams. The next morning I felt great, but later in the day a bit weird. Hard to explain, maybe a bit anxious and distracted. Decided not to take it the next day and still had very vivid dreams. This dream effect lasted for about a week before wearing off. Seems like the stuff should be out of a person's system before that, but that is my anecdotal experience. Tried another.25 tablet and had pretty much the same experience. I use a Zeo to track sleep, and I noticed something I had never seen before, which is that during one part of the night my sleep was so deep it didn't even register. Had the same anxiety/distraction later that day. The next night I didn't take it and had similar sleep experiences. When I woke and checked my Zeo I saw that there was a part of the night that showed I was awake. Very strange because I had no memory of it. Later that morning it came to me and I remembered being awake and thinking about a variety of things but I might never had remembered that if it weren't for the Zeo reminding me. This is a very strange thing to happen and kind of reminds me of some of those stories you hear about people on Ambien doing nutty things at night and not remembering them.So, am I just hypersensitive? Is this a typical reaction? Who knows. Not a lot of info for this supplement. I'm personally worried about trying a higher dose, but that worry might be unfounded. There is some discussion on some of the forums about some neurotoxic effects of this supplement, but that is also speculation at this point. Anyway, I'm giving 3 stars as it is clearly effective, but are the effects good/healthy or not? I don't know. So for the time being, I'll be putting this supplement aside."
4671,"TIGI Bed Head Manipulator, 2 Ounce (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,"The Tigi Bed Head Manipulator is available in most stores but they charge nearly $19 for one...that's ridiculous. I love the fact that I can get 2 for that price here on Amazon. Anyways, I have thinning hair, so it doesn't look so good when I style it with any hair gel/paste products, but I think that this one makes it look better. Plus, it has a nice scent to it."

4678,Millers Forge Cat Brush,0/0,4.0,"...says my cat. She really loves the feel of this brush. As another reviewer said, the hair is not easy to remove from between the bristles, but for a cat with shorter hair this is the best brush that I have found. The handle fits comfortably in my hand and the head of the brush is larger than most. I would recommend this product, although I am reserving one star because it is Made in China."

4680,"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,5.0,These batteries remain fresh for 7 years which makes them a good investment for any earthquake kits or storage. They are also mercury free which is better for the environment when they are discarded. I was getting frustrated with how often I had to change batteries in my digital camera and these batteries have lasted longer than any battery I have ever used in my camera. They aren't rechargeable but they are lasting a lot longer than the rechargeable ones I have used in the past. In fact I haven't replaced them yet in my cameras! So I am very happy with them.
4681,JW Pet Good Cuz Rubber Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"I have purchased several of the Good Cuz toys from Amazon. Yep...my dog chews the feet off in the first 10 minutes. And the squeeker is gone shortly thereafter (the neighbors are greatful for that). But, even without feet and a squeeker, I never see him without one of these toys in his mouth. He is a very strong dog, and every once in a while I'll find one of these toys in pieces. But for the most part, they hold up pretty well. A large Good Cuz toy will last my dog 6-8 months. They look pretty strange by the time he's finished with one, but he wouldn't do without it."

4686,Melissa & Doug Classic ABC Block Cart,0/0,5.0,"These blocks are sturdy, my daughter loves stacking them and taking them out of the wagon, then putting them back in. Eventually, they will help her learn her letters. I love toys that grow with your kids!"
4687,LifeSource UA-774AC Dual Memory Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with Medium and Large Cuff and AC Adapter,0/0,5.0,I had this product for eight years. Eventually the blood pressure monitor developed an internal leak in the pressure generator. The company provided a complete replacement with a payment for shipping charges only ($11.00).The product is able to compute heart rate even in the presence of fibrillation (my reason for choosing it in the first place). I have had the opportunity to compare it with readings taken at a doctor's office. It is quite accurate. Batteries last for years with daily use.Quite remarkable.Mike Ryan
4688,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"Really good protein for the average builder, nice and tasty and is pretty clean. There are better and more clean proteins out there for cutting and toning if you want to look around though."
4689,Omron HEM-790IT Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Omron Health Management Software,0/0,4.0,"I like this unit a lot over my other machine. It has a much larger memory, comes with software to download my readings to print out for the doctor and keep as an Excel record. It keeps track of more than one user, detects irregular rhythms (which I have), which is good to show the doctor with the corresponding blood pressure reading.My only complaint is that it doesn't have an audible beep. I have several arrhythmias and my old basic unit beeps with each heart beat. That helps me to understand what I'm feeling at the time."
4690,"Nature's Way Charcoal, Activated",1/14,1.0,"I'd bet the company pays shills to write great remarks because nothing works like this product which leaves with a dry mouth, but heck it's charcoal. These company's should be boycotted who produce this garbage fleecing people of hard earned money to swell their heads."
4691,Giant Microbes Bookworm (Anobium punctatum) Plush Toy,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this little bookworm toy and think it is a great gift for a student or anyone who loves books. It's cute but also somewhat educational, and I like the Giant Microbes because they make you think as well. As a med student, they are a nice, affordable go-to present for friends or colleagues."
4692,Manhattan Toy Winkel,0/0,4.0,"Easy for little hands to grasp. A little heavier than it looks. Fairly quiet rattle sound. Bright colors. It hasn't become a favorite of my child yet, but I still have hope. This is a really cute toy. I like to hang it from his activity gym and he does grasp it. It is just a little quieter than the toys he likes at this point."
4693,GladRags The Keeper,0/0,1.0,". Insertion wasn't a problem but when the thick top pops open it feels like being punched. The stem scratched me so I tried removing it so I could cut the stem. I could either grip the cup or release the suction, not both so it didn't move much. It took over and hour to work it down far enough to fold and many bruises from it popping open because I lost my grip many times after that on the textureless surface. I feel like I was kicked in the stomach repeatedly and I need a crime scene team to clean my bathroom.Side note"
4694,Bohnanza,0/0,5.0,"This is a game that I discovered by accident and I can't be happier that I did. This game is a nice & easy counterpart to some more complex games that I play regularly with my game group, and the beauty lies in the simplicity. Each player (2-7 can play) attempt to collect similar types of beans (which are comically illustrated on the cards) & harvest those beans for gold coins. The most coins at the end of the game wins.Although the game is very simple on the surface, the fun & replay ability comes from the fact that you are allowed (and encouraged!) to interact with your competitors. Most of the game action involves trying to negotiate trades between players to try and accumulate the beans you want while getting rid of the beans you don't. The strategy isn't too difficult, but if you aren't in the mood for a deeply involved, hours long game then this is perfect. I would put it nearly on par with7 Wonders Gamefor depth of strategy (although 7 Wonders is a little more difficult as there are many more rules).The first time through this game was a little difficult to understand the dynamic, but now I am able to teach a table full of beginners in about 10 minutes. Being a card only game, setup time is virtually non-existent. Just unbox & play! The only thing to note is that you use slightly different arrangements of which cards get used for different numbers of players. This also prevents some cards from wearing faster than others which is a complaint I have with some other card games that use specific cards more often than others (Dominionspecifically)."
4695,"Method Foaming Hand Soap, 10-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"I like the foaming action, even use it to shave sometimes. Just the right size for the bathroom countertop. easy dispensing."

4698,Butt Face Soap,0/0,5.0,"This was the last gift to be stolen and was stolen many times. Huge hit and got a lot of laughs. Hint is to wrap so that ""face"" is the first thing seen when opening."
4699,"Parker Spectra 360 Electrode Gel, Clear Tube with Stand-Up Cap",0/0,5.0,"Bought a heart rate monitor and figured I could get away with simply using water on the sensors to help with the readings, but obviously water rolls off quite quickly and easily, so I decided to purchase this electrode gel to help get a better reading.I use an amount about the size of my pinky fingernail on the sensors. The gel is thick enough that it stays put, but not so thick that it feels like you've got paste on yourself. I like that it stays put on the sensors far better than plain water does, and it has improved the ability of the HRM to keep giving me a reading vs. plain water, which would give me intermittent readings.Given the amount that I need to use (pinky fingernail's worth), this 8.5 oz tube seems like it'll last several months, if not closer to a year!There's very little odor to this, and what odor I do notice reminds me of hand sanitizer or something similarly non-offensive. Regardless, with the miniscule amount you need to use, there should be no issue with the smell."
4700,Uncle Milton Moon In My Room,3/3,1.0,"I bought this for my daughter and I like it.What I don't like is that a week later, I see Costo sell the set (moon & planet earth) for $9.99.It's my bad I didn't shop around, but want to warn other buyers"

I usually take two at a time and then if later on in the day my tummy still hurts i'll take one more and that will usually do the trick if the first two didn't do it at first :) Very good product.

4719,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,4.0,"I needed a dog bed that my girls would not destroy. They tend to unstuff all of the pillow type beds I buy for them. My only problem is that I bought the large size because they like to sleep together and I wanted them to have plenty of room, but the bed is too big for the area I had intended to put it. I thought about exchanging for a smaller size, but they really seem to like it, so I am going to keep it for basement or outdoor use and purchase another one in a smaller size for them to use in the house. I have two 13&#34; beagles, so they will still have plenty of room to snuggle up on the medium or small size."

One thing that we do to make cleaning easier is to usually leave a slight film behind (not buff up everything).I'll admit that being a new stove, we haven't compared this to other products yet. Our earlier stove was harvest gold (hint on its age), so we used anything in the cabinet to get that one clean from Comet to the occasional razor or steel wool pad."

I heard this stuff is great for that.I'm 3 days into taking it and realized that I am eating myself out of house and home, and meanwhile my supply isn't going up. I look it up and voila, found the culprit. This is also commonly used for people that have appetite issues.It did not increase my supply, but I can see how logically speaking if there were someone out there that didn't have a great supply that may be due to lack of eating enough, this could surely help them. With all of that extra eating I was also getting more water in (which is usually hard for me seeing as how I drink like a fish as it is)."

4736,HeroQuest Game System,0/0,5.0,"This games is a long time favorite with great components and atmosphere, plus rules that are so simple that you can learn them as you play. Though it was designed for ages 10 and up, there is a ton of room to add additional rules and create a virtual role-playing game using the simple combat and spell systems as a basis...or just keep it a light and fun dungeon crawl as intended. With the expansions and fan-made quests available on line, it has enormous replay value as well. Nothing quite compares to HeroQuest in my opinion, and I now have all of the highly coveted US Quest Packs in my collection. If you decide to obtain a copy, check eBay first as some of the prices being asked on Amazon are absurd."
4737,Mon-Sieur Bome Vol. 16,0/0,5.0,Pro- Beautifully sculpted figure- Good paint job- Mirrored base- Its an OniCon- Just tell them you are a huge fan of Japanese Mythology...
4738,Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy,0/0,3.0,"I got this to try and keep my puppy entertained. It is durable enough for him he was under 10lbs at the time and did enjoy it. However since the two pieces screw together he would sometimes rotate and close it shut. There was no lock point so you can click to a setting. It had to stay loose so i didn't find it all that stimulating and he'd get bored with it if it closed up on him. Not the best toy, glad it didn't cost too much."
4739,Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Styling Wax Hair Styling Waxes,0/0,5.0,My wife's hairdresser recommended it and we both use it. Pricey but doesn't look greasy and works for both my thick hair and her finer hair.
4740,"Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)",0/0,5.0,"i live by this product, i have had acne scars for a long time and this peel fades them away in just a few uses!! if like me, you have suffered with self esteem issues because of acne scars and you perpetuate acne by wearing more makeup, this peel may be able to stop that nasty cycle. as you can see from other reviews, it didnt work for every body, but it MAY work for you, and it is not so expensive so why not try it. i use a fan brush and now do the peel every month (began the regimen by doing it every 10 days), you can do it more or less often, and it does not make your skin dependent on it, i have hormonal issues causing adult acne so i scar regularly but this diminishes it fast without needing to wear so much makeup.btw it doesnt particularly clear acne, just removes dead dry skin, and if your acne is caused by excessive dry skin (like mine) it can help the acne situationgood luck, and i hope it is your solution like it was mine &#60;3"
4741,Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Activity Walker,0/0,3.0,This item works best for a child that already walks. I bought this to help my son learn how to walk but every time he tried to walk it would tip back. Once he started walking he loved to use it.
4742,Wesco Pet Kabob Shreddable Bird Toy,1/1,5.0,"My Cockatiels like this product. I have the 'Ole' size and I was surprised at how large it was... they will be chewing and shredding this thing for awhile.I noticed the price fluctuates, so you may want to watch that and pick up a few when it the price is less.I've also had the original size, and that is good too... definitely better if you want something smaller, but it won't last as long as the 'ole' size.Bottom line is that this is a good chew toy."
4743,"Achva Vanilla Sesame Havla, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)",0/0,3.0,Buyers should understand that if they are accustomed to the sweeter brands of Halvah they might find this brand to be on the bland side. Especially if you are used to Joyvah brand halvah then Achva might be an acquired taste.
4744,"No Pudge! Fat Free Fudge Brownie Mix, Mint, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"No Pudge! Fat Free Fudge Brownie Mix, Mint, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)I buy this product a lot as it makes a wonderful chewy fat free brownie!!

4746,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,5.0,I am not sure how people managed without the blue indicator. I love how easy it is to see if I need to change a diaper.
4747,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey,0/0,5.0,I used Optimum Nutrition for a year and I got great results. I left it to try other whey protein blends ( I am a vegetarian so I stick with whey) and even though I kept lifting I started getting a layer of fat over my muscle that I found unattractive. I went back to Optimum Nutrition and within a week I saw a difference. I love it.
4748,Charming Party Collar,0/0,5.0,Love these collars and they come in different colors with different themes. They are so fun and festive! They &#34;jingle bell&#34; ones are perfect for giving your dog a cute &#34;seasonal&#34; look for any holiday photos you might use in your Christmas cards and the Halloween ones on your furry friend make adorable facebook photos!!!One last thing
4749,Radio Flyer 12S Classic Walker Wagon,0/0,4.0,"This is a sturdy little wagon. Our little guy loves it!It wasn't too hard to assemble and all the pieces fit together very well.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's very hard for him to turn, so you either need room to go straight or constantly help your little one adjust the steering."
4750,Safari,0/0,5.0,I think Scheilch does a great job with detail and durability. We have purchased Breyer items that were not as high quality. I would recommend all of their animals.
4751,Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper,0/0,5.0,"This is the best nail clipper ever. Nice weight. Solid design for a good grip, and it is extremely sharp. I have so many pairs of these I lost count. Get both finger and toe nail clippers !"
4752,SmartCat 3833 Peek-a-Prize Pet Toy Box,0/0,5.0,"I saw one like this at my friend's house and decided to get one for my cats. They loved it and still do!!! It comes with 2 balls, however, I also bought some mice to put inside it and now the cats enjoy &#34;fishing&#34; for the mice with their paws. It is really funny to watch the cats play with it."
4753,Sally Hansen Creme Bleach Face,0/0,5.0,Good and effective as well as affordable. I used it on my face and all the unwanted hair vanished. SA
4754,Family Games paradux,0/0,4.0,"Another unique twist on the four in a row game concept, as you must move your opponents pieces along with yours. The peices and the board are very well made and the game is simple to learn and yet is pure skill and great fun. Held off on giving it five stars, only because the GIPF series of games has taken this concept further and those games offer greater depth. Better than One UP for two players, both are nice additions to this series."
4755,"Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Apricot, 0.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 30)",0/0,4.0,I liked the fruity apricot taste. I would prefer it to be a little more tart and a little less sweet.
4756,Stainless Steel Pet Coop Cup,2/3,4.0,"Can't say too much about this cup only that it works as intended! The clamp holds the cup very secure. It doesn't budge once you screw it down tight (but not too tight!). I ordered the 8oz cup to use as my dog's food bowl (I previously bought a 32oz cup that hangs). Having both the clamp and hang-style cups, I must say that either one will work. However, I would advise against getting the large (48oz+) cup in the clamp-style version. That much weight with food or water in it may put a lot of tension on the welds of the clamp over time. Nonetheless, I'm impressed with this cup. Definitely worth purchasing.***12/26/12 Update"
4757,Cover Girl Outlast Smoothwear All-Day Smooth Feel Lipcolor Lip Glosses,0/0,5.0,I love CoverGirl lip color. I can even wear this one with cool or warm colors. The pearly effect is nice.

4759,Murad Essential-C Cleanser Facial Cleansing Gels,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love this cleanser and the entire product line. You can buy it through an esthetician or Massage Envy, but it's a much better price through Amazon. It cleans very well without drying out my face. Great for removing makeup, and it has a fresh citrus scent, very mild. I've tried many products, trying to find something that works on my skin without drying or being too greasy, and this is the best I've found!"
4760,Wine-Opoly Monopoly Board Game,0/0,5.0,These opoly games are great fun for game night with family and friends. If you like games then you need to get some of these.
4761,Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,0/0,4.0,It does a good job protecting the edge of the cement hearth. The edge of our hearth has a scallop edge so it doesn't look very straight but thats no fault of the product. Over all its a great product.
4762,Diesel Green By Diesel For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces,0/0,4.0,"ok ok Okey this product is exelent, the product is fine, beautiful and economic, good choice, I am very happy whit tis product"
4763,Queen Helene Facial Masques (Masks),0/0,5.0,I am not sure it reduce the black heads but def dry up your skin when you apply. It also smells amazing.
4764,Persil Gel Color Liquid Laundry Detergent 1.35liter liquid by Persil,0/0,5.0,I believe the persil products are the best I have found for keeping my clothes clean and looking like new. I use each of their products because they keep my colors better than any other product I have used.
4765,"Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Black",1/1,5.0,"I have 4 cats and little patience for scooping litter boxes. I've tried the automatic type with the rake - horrible! I've also tried manual shifting litter boxes. One is similar to this, but without the motor. The other required that you lift it and roll it, and inevitably, litter ended up on the floor.This is fantastic! My cats took to it pretty quickly with the help of a litter attractant. I just have one claustrophobic diva who insists on using an open litter box - and I'm okay with that."
4766,All-One (Nutri-Tech) Green Phyto-Base Powder,0/0,5.0,"Easy to digest. Not tasty, but I feel a noticeable difference when I take these vitamins vs. days I miss taking them - something that I never noticed with vitamin pills in the past. I have been taking this particular vitamin for years now and would still recommend All One!"
4767,Schleich Triceratops,0/0,5.0,"Awesome replica. Not as cool as the t-rex or the spino, but still very cool. My son likes the big ones better, but he is only 2, so what does he know?"
4768,"Wild Republic Cat Floppy Orange Tabby 7""",0/0,5.0,The face is really cute and the cat was well constructed and lifelike. I am very happy with this item.
4769,Scott's Cakes Glazed Pecans in a Decorative Bag,0/0,3.0,"I was expecting whole pecans. I was disappointed to find nothing but crumbles. I can still use the crumbles on ice cream, but I would have preferred whole pecans"
4770,The Game Charades,0/0,4.0,The game itself is fun once you get the hang of it. But it is hard to keep score. It should come with a digital timer or something and a buzzer.
4771,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I own a small Spitz dog and she loves anything involving hunting. She adores it !Surprisingly, she did not be able to destroy it at all, no matter how hard she played with the squirrels and the trunks. It's a great product, I highly recommend it.Also, very fast shipping !"
4772,Jolly Pet Push-n-Play,0/0,5.0,"Ball is well built I drilled out the plug hole to allow for some BB shot to be put in there for noise! Heeler pup goes crazy for it! Snow is outside, so she can't take it outside yet. She runs by and jumps off it to get it moving and she is only 4 months old! She herds it all around the house.Update:We have lost all our puppy teeth, and she can scratch into the side of the ball as she is biting and chasing it. She will actually stand on top of the ball, and bite down on it and it will move out from under her. I just use a razor blade and cut off the longer pieces, but I didn't think this would happen!!!! She will have this for years no doubt, but I was truly shocked when she started biting into it and scoring slivers off like cheese in a cheese grater. It is funny how she knows that the bathroom is a dead end street, the kitchen tile moves a lot faster than the carpet, and how the coffee table is something that she can lap over and over again. She will chase the ball into a pine cabinet I made in junior high school, and I am afraid that she is going to split one of the doors in half. It is made out of 1"" pine, but one door doesn't make noise when the ball hits it, so she has perfect the technique to have it hit the one that does! I would also imagine come spring/summertime that the ball would be a bit difficult to clean beings I have all these deep scratches in it, if it was not cleaned up right after playtime."
4773,Joop! Homme Cologne by Joop! for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,"Some reviews said musky in a european sort of way, what ever that means. All I know is it smells good and people notice it in a nice way."
4774,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,5.0,I've been using Waterpiks for many years and was a bit disappointed with the previous model that I purchased. This version works fine and seems to do a great job on my teeth too. I'm very happy with it.
4775,Little Helper Childrens Mop,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old son, he loves to try to help me with whatever I'm doing. It's great! Just the right size. I think it should be for a good while."
4776,Now Foods Virgin Coconut Oil,0/0,5.0,I highly recommend this product from this seller. The glass jar is very sturdy I dropped it once on accident and nothing happened so im really about that. And when it arrived it was covered in a lot of bubble wrap to ensure that it doesn't get broken bcuz a lot of mail people don't care what's inside a package and will handle it however so im really happy about that
4777,Toblerone Swiss Milk Chocolate With Honey & Almond Nougat 3.52oz,0/0,2.0,"I should have looked closer as I thought this was the large Toblerone bars that you used to have to buy in the duty free shops while traveling. Those larger bars and this size - are both available from ""big box"" stores. The size of this bar makes it not a great value for the cost. Can secure this for MUCH less right in your local store - and even at full price locally, you can get it for less than this one cost. As for the bar itself. I have liked these for the better part of 20 years - they NEVER disappoint. Great candy... just not great value."
4778,"Gund Uglydoll Clip-On Ox, 3.9"" Plush",0/0,5.0,"I got my wife an full size OX uglydoll when she was sick and she fell in love with ""her"".

4781,Snuggle Safe Pet Bed Microwave Heating Pad,0/0,3.0,"I heard about this product from the vet tech so I was really excited to get something that pops in the microwave and stays warm for hours on end for the critters!However, it is so hard that my cat refuses to sit on it and I didn't want to put it under a blanket as I didn't think it'd be warm enough for her, so now it sits unused in the corner...I will give it another try putting it under a blanket and if my cat still won't use it, I will have to donate it..."

4797,Jaybird and Mais MOLESKIN Moleskin Roll (2 in. wide),0/0,5.0,Using this roll for a medical pouch on my bail-out bag. The 2 inch width means you can get some good coverage for those &#34;hot spots&#34; on your feet when walking long distances. The adhesive is strong and stays on well even with sweat. It's nice to have this much moleskin so you don't run out if you need to replace a patch.
4798,Fleur de Sel de Guerande - French finest sea salt Le Paludier 4.4 oz,0/0,5.0,Who would think salt could have different favors. This is beautiful to look at and taste. Very delicate. Made me happy just to look at it. I smile every time I sprinkle it on my food.
4799,Earth Henna Earth Henna Body Painting Kit Mini,0/0,5.0,"I've tried other at-home henna tattoo kits, and I've even gotten tattoos done by artists at local craft fairs and such, and I've never had such a good experience as I had with this kit. The instructions are simple and clear, everything worked as described, and I got clean, even lines for my designs that stayed on and darkened to a good color very quickly. I haven't waited long enough to see how long the designs will last - I will update this in a few weeks to report on durability. But as far as ease of use and good quality ingredients, I am VERY pleased and will order this kit again.Note"
4800,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,0/0,3.0,"I've been checking this against the cuff at my clinic, and it's been running about 10-20 points high. I'm just going to adjust for that, considering the reasonable price. After a recent illness, I'm down to 95 pounds, and at the tightest cuff clinch, it still slides down my arm, though there is plenty room available to those of you with large upper arms, there is none for tiny folks."
4801,Marvis Paradise Fruit Italian Toothpaste,0/0,5.0,"this is the best toothpaste in the world, hands down! i swear its making my teeth whiter, or maybe its just making me happier because i love the packaging so much. either way."

4804,"100% Whey, Chocolate Mint 5 lb",0/0,5.0,I used Optimum Nutrition for a year and I got great results. I left it to try other whey protein blends ( I am a vegetarian so I stick with whey) and even though I kept lifting I started getting a layer of fat over my muscle that I found unattractive. I went back to Optimum Nutrition and within a week I saw a difference. I love it.
4805,BABYBJORN Safe Step,1/1,5.0,Safe as houses and very cute. Im sitting here trying to think of any cons but really its just well made plastic stool for kids so there's not much more to say
4806,"Nioxin Cleanser, System 1 (Fine/Untreated/Normal to Thin-Looking)",1/1,5.0,"I am in my late 50's and when you age, your hair just loses it lustre. The shine is gone and it eally just has that old lady, cotton candy look. I thought I would try the Nioxin system for color-treated hair. Previously, I was using WEN products and that really helped, but with the WEN I had to wash my hair every single day.So I picked some Nioxin up at my salon to give it a try. The Nioxin is a 3 part product, shampoo, conditioner, and then a scalp treatment that I try to remember to use. With Nioxin, I can get away with washing my hair every 3-4 days, and it looks great! Of course, I throw it up on my head and braid it after the first day, but I tell you I love this product better than WEN. so really, since I don't wash my hair everyday, it cost less than WEN.I highly recommend it to everyone. I met with a friend of mine I hadn't seen in a while and she wanted to know what I was doing to my hair. She went online immediately to get some!I would recommend to anyone losing their hair, like combing it and lots and lots of hair coming out, or it coming out in the shower--see your doctor. This could be a problem with thyroid that will not be helped by any hair product. If your labs check out fine, then you should go for the product. Actually, go for it regardless but do see your doctor!"
4807,Charming Party Collar,0/0,4.0,"The collar is absolutely adorable. The dog was slightly annoyed by it. The jiggle bells are nice and aren't to load, so its not to bad listening to your dog walk around"
4808,API Calcium Test Kit,0/1,1.0,"I ordered this product online because where I live there is no place to get saltwater test kits. When I received the kit, it only had one test bottle in it! Very disappointed, this mistake put me back a week on my aquarium set up."
4809,Turbie Twist Hair Towel 6 Pack,0/0,5.0,"I bought one of these at a local store and loved it, however, it was taken from our hotel bathroom with the towels. The hotel never located it in the laundry so I decided to but several from Amazon at a great price. I loathe heavy towels around my hair so this is perfect."
4810,"Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, White",1/1,5.0,This dryer works very well and I get professional results every time I use it. It drys my hair fast and It is easy to pack away when finished.
4811,Fishbowl Filter,0/0,2.0,Should come with the tube that you have to attach to it to even work. Very vague instructions. cheaply made
4812,"Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion, 4-Ounce Bottle",1/1,4.0,I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent and i bought this to use on my rashes. it helps stop the itches but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gonna help. This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb.
4813,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,0/0,5.0,"So far I have been amazed by this dryer. I have never wanted to spend the extra cash for a pro dryer, but after nearly dying from electrocution from my last cheapo drugstore unit, and almost burning down the house with the one before that, I decided to go for it. A world of difference. Powerful force of air that blows right through my long hair without crisping it. The horrifying whine made by any other dryer I have owned is a low frequency hum from this Baby(liss). Drying time is less than half of what it used to be. Sexy rubberized matte black finish is oh so appealing. Buy this one!"
4814,Vitamin C Crystals Ascorbic Acid 100% Pure Powder,0/0,3.0,"Product seems to be good- thats what 3 stars are for -I havent used it long enough to say anything muhc about the sameBut came in somewhat damaged packaging . The cover of the jar has a small tab to pull to remove the seal.The tab was half undered the lid itself- it took 2 of us to remove the seal. Under the seal there is a paper seal, which again was a little damaged.Wondering if it might have impacted the quality of the product.Keeping it as would be too much of a hassle to return the same"
4815,"Abracadabra Unicorn 27"" by Douglas Cuddle Toys",0/0,1.0,"While this unicorn is beautiful, it is a lot smaller than we expected. What a huge disappointment when we opened up our box. $40 is expensive for the size that it is. I should have just bought the one I saw at Ross, it was double the size but the same price. This was supposed to be the ""big"" gift from Santa but now we have to find something else.Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful and if size doesn't matter, go for it. But don't get it if you are expecting a larger size. Arrived quickly but can't help but feel disappointed."
4816,K&H Thermo Bird Perch,0/0,3.0,"I have used these perches for 10 years. I have one medium for my Eclectus and one large for my African Grey. Both love them.Nice to use year round, when the house is cold or after a shower.Safe to leave on when I am not at home. It uses very little energy, so I leave it on all the time.These are not without fault though. They break very easily. The least amount of pressure will break them. Cheaply made.It's a good idea to remove them from the cage for cleaning and avoid using pressure, or they will snap at the end that attaches to the cage.In conclusion, my birds LOVE them, but they are too much money for a poorly designed product.Will I keep buying them? Yes, my birds love them so much.K&H; Thermo-Perch Heated Bird Perch medium- 13"" length x 1.25"" diameter"
4817,"Loops 2 Double Handle Nylon Leash, 6-Foot, Blue",0/0,3.0,This is a nice leash with a sturdy clip. The loop is smaller and lower than expected. It is great for a large dog but for a small or medium sized dog the loop is too low as you have to bend down to get it.
4818,"XeroSox Waterproof Cast Cover - Full Leg - Large - 21"" and up",0/0,5.0,I had ankle surgery and was in a plaster splint for 2 weeks. I didn't want to fool around with a trash bag and tape or a leg cast protector from the store as they are very cheaply made and still allow water in. This completely covered my splint and I had no issues.
4819,Desolv It Citrus Solution 12.6oz,0/0,1.0,Absolutely DID NOT work. I removed a label from a bottle and all I wanted to do was get rid of the tacky glue left behind. Tried the product probably about ten times and it did not work at all. I am VERY disappointed with the product. Amagingly the lable says WORKS 100% of THE TIME. NONSENSE
4820,"EQyss Micro-Tek Medicated Pet Spray, 16-Ounce",1/1,5.0,"I have an Am Staff with horrible skin issues. I hate having to have her on steroids and meds all of the time, and a co-worker told me about this spray, along with the shampoo. It is wonderful and has made a huge difference in her skin. I highly recommend this product."
4821,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Doll Furniture - Bed,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my 8 year old for her American Girl doll. Plenty of space for her doll, really nice paint and it is made of wood unlike the overpriced plastic bed made by American Doll. I would highly recommend this."
4822,Bella B Tummy Honey Cream - 4 oz,0/0,1.0,"It's a nice moisturizer and it smells ok but it did not work for me after using it for over two months. My stretch marks are not from pregnancy and they are over a year old but I read some reviews from people in similar situations that had positive results so I figured I would give it a try. However, it's just lotion, that's all."
4823,Herbal Whole Raw Aloe Vera Juice 33.8 fl. oz.,0/0,1.0,"I thought this was Whole Raw Aloe Vera Juice when I purhased it, but found that it is actually a herbal and Aloe Vera Juice composite. I choose not to take Astragulus on a routine basis. Taken everyday it loses it's ability to boost the immune system when needed. I rue the day I wasted hard earned money on it."
4824,C.E.T. Oral Hygiene Kit for Cats,0/1,1.0,Neither of my cats were interested in the toothpaste and rejected both the brush and the finger applicator. Impossible to use and I had such high hopes from other reviews.
4825,iCellTech Size 13 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,1.0,It seems there is something wrong with the batteries. They do not even last for 1 hour and they should last for at least 5 days. Is there a number I can call to talk with Local Battery?
4826,Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light,0/0,4.0,I hope it is what she wanted. :-) it came very quick and pleased with what I have seen. Affordable too.
4827,"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",0/0,5.0,"I actually use these more for cleaning my toddlers straws (playtex lil grippers sippys) and they work brillantly for getting them cleaned properly. They worked pretty well when she was on bottles as well, used them for Medela nipples.. Great price too ; )"
4828,Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue,0/0,5.0,Make sure you don't try and save money on a knock off. I purchased it on amazon but from dolce and gabbana and it smells identical (because it is) to the scent you get direct. My girlfriend has worn it for years as her favorite scent (which I love) and I wanted to give her a refill. Lovely.
4829,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,3.0,"I received this yesterday as a sort of Christmas present for our dog, a 'golden-doodle'. He had all three squirrels out in less than 1 minute so the getting them out part of the fun didn't last long. Within 2-3 hours he figured out if he just shook the tree around all three squirrels would literally fly out in 2-3 seconds in impressive fashion.One of the three squirrels is unrecognizable 24 hours later, tattered to pieces, a second is hanging on with stuffing bleeding out and the third is mostly intact. The 'tree' hasn't held up much better, there is already a new hole in the bottom. I'm thinking within 2-3 days the entire setup will be destroyed.Our dog is definitely kept busy by it and likes to play with both the squirrels and tree. The moment he notices the squirrels are back in the tree he rushes to the tree and shakes them all out and fuddles around with them for awhile. The down side is it just isn't very durable. We had a floor full of stuffing within an hour of leaving out the new toy from the 1st dead squirrel. I'm fairly sure I'll end up throwing away what remains of this toy in about 3-4 days.If your dog is less of a chewer, this is probably a great toy. If your dog is feisty and likes to kill animal toys (like mine) this won't last long."
4830,"Now Foods, L-Lysine 500 mg Vegetarian",1/1,5.0,"After I got influenza a few years back I got the worst cold sore outbreak I've ever had. I was a mess. A doctor prescribed me an antiviral. Later another doctor who I was having drinks with (and not on the clock) confirmed that the prescription antivirals aren't really very helpful. I've never had any luck with them anyways. She told me to take large doses of lysine (5000 mg a day) each day if I feel an outbreak starting and it should nip it in the bud. I had nothing to lose and lysine is super cheap.The next time I felt that familiar soreness and tingling, I started taking lysine. The next day there was no swelling and the tingling and pain were 100% gone. I kept this up for years without a single outbreak.Sometimes if you act slowly you can't help it. Once it gets the white swells of visible pus, you are doomed to a beautiful cold sore. It takes some getting used to to know when is too late. Sometimes the difference between too late and just in time is only an hour or two. You need to just have this on hand and start it the second you feel anything. In fact, you should start it when you know you've had a trigger. For me it's anything that causes a fever and excessive sunshine (sun is a common one, didn't learn that until this year). The key for this to work is catching it early enough.This is the best and only cold sore cure out there. It really, really works. I am a convert. I have bottles of lysine everywhere I go frequently, so I am never surprised and miss a chance. I have one when I travel, one at work, one at home, and one at my parents' house for when I visit."
4831,Alias,0/0,5.0,This toy is something I've wanted since these toys were released. I was so happy to see it on here for a great price. I received the package in great shape and very quickly. Highly recommend this seller!
4832,Artemis Woman Heel Smoother Pedicure Appliance,0/0,1.0,Used it only for a few weeks and It even made things worse!!! I'm back to the always safe manual tool it needs more &#34;elbow work&#34; but gives so much better results than this product.
4833,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,This nail polish is not only a beautiful red but it is very sexy. Went on smoothly and stayed on well.
4834,"Yogi St. John's Wort Blues Away, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",1/1,4.0,"I am 45 years 'young' and I know stress intimately. I am a disabled veteran with stress related injuries and this product has helped keep stress at bay. Dealing with irritable people, you know the people who know how to push our buttons, the ones who don't go away. Drinking this tea will help you as it has helped me. The taste is okay, doable especially since it works so well for me."
4835,"Masada Bath Salts, Refreshing Rain Forest, Dead Sea Mineral, 64 oz (1.814 kg)",0/0,5.0,THis is a nice mineral bath. It has a pleasant scent and I feel very relaxed when bathing in this.
4836,Burberry Touch For Men,0/0,4.0,"This is a great cologne and lasts forever. Sometimes a little to sweet smelling, but it mixes well with other colognes and scentes. Not too overpowering."
4837,Melissa & Doug Horse Plush,0/0,5.0,"So My daughter asked me for a horse..... Granted I cant afford one. However, I could afford this... She loves it. Fast delivery, reasonable price, and strong enough to withstand a 60lb 5 year old. Overall great buy."
4838,Bella B Tummy Honey Butter - 4 oz,0/0,5.0,fit perfectly and was a solid product for an outstanding price. I would definately purchase again. Anyone needing these will be happy with the quality/price. My wife used it every day during pregnancy and only had minimal stretch marks.
4839,Breast Actives 1 KIT Breast Enhancement Kit by Breast Gain Plus 1 - 60 Tablet Bottle and 1 - 2 fl Oz Jar of Cream,0/0,1.0,"I used this for about 3 months, and it didnt do anything. If fact, im pretty sure it just caused me to gain like 5 pounds. Biggest waste of money ever! I spent over 200 on 6 month supply."
4840,Cardinal Industries Double Fifteen Color Dot Dominoes in a Collectors Tin,0/0,4.0,"I have read the recent reviews and most reviewers do not seem happy with the quality. It seems like the product or the manufacturing has changed since when I bought it a few years ago. The set I have is of good quality, heavy and durable dominoes, colorful train markers and have no problem with the dot colors. I give this 4 stars because the center holder for playing Mexican Train seems flimsy and there are only 4 trains. If you like playing Mexican Train, you may want to consider a set with more &#34;bells and whistles&#34;."
4841,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I got the ""junior"" size for my 11 pound dog. She loves it. She's 2, and impossible to tire out. She likes both pulling the squirrels out of the tree thing and just playing with the squirrels themselves. She chases them and then sits and squeaks for fairly long periods of time and they are still all completely intact. After the first couple of times she could get them out pretty quickly, but she still had fun doing it, and waits for me to put them all back in. The squirrels themselves are really cute. The only problem is keeping track of all the squirrels."
4842,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,5.0,"We got these for my daughter when she was about 1.5 and she started doing the fish puzzle right away- it definitely helped her learn colors, she knew them all within a couple weeks.The number and letter puzzles came a couple months later, closer to her second birthday but she quickly mastered those, too. It's been over a year and these puzzles are still played with a ton. Happy we got this set!"
4843,Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit,0/0,5.0,I had always wanted to learn how to make sushi (its so expensive when you go out to eat). A friend bought me this for my birthday and I really enjoyed and and want to recommend it to anybody who wants to get into making sushi.
4844,"Mother's Special Blend All Natural Skin Toning Oil, 8-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,it has helped alot with the itching problem and although i still have many marks on my belly i feel it made the redness leave faster. I put it on after the shower and it feel so good!! i highly recommend :)
4845,Kinder Country Milk Chocolate with Rich Milk Filling ( 9's ),0/0,4.0,"growing up in Italy i ate plenty of kinder. it's nice to find them in here. Price is just ok, as i could find them for .75c in NYC. but considering the free shipping which is very convenient i was happy with my purchase"
4846,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"On the first night of using this product, my husband and I FINALLY got a good night's sleep. We have new neighbors who have a barking dog in an outdoor kennel and a LOUD truck that gets started at 4:15 am and he let's it run for 15 minutes before he leaves for work. We haven't slept much since they moved in but it's not a problem any longer. I highly recommend this product...it truly works."
4847,"Kendall Disposable Underpads (Chux Style), DURAsorb, 23 X 36"" Bed Size, case of 150. (212-1051)",0/0,5.0,"Actual Kendall branded stuff. Hard to come by. Initially company sent the wrong pads, but a quick contact to their customer service department fixed it. Wonderful folks to work with.The pads themselves work as intended. The fill is much thicker than some other generic brands that are available, but I think Kendall (the manufacturer) may be skimping out on the fill as a previous order of this exact brand and model from a while back appears to be thicker (totally qualitative, I did not perform any comparative studies).Overall I am satisfied that I got the real stuff."
4848,"POOF-Slinky 0X2460 Ideal What's In Ned's Head Game with 15"" Plush Head",0/0,5.0,Can't wait to play with my eight year old and twelve year old boy. They like all things gross and that fits.
4849,"Safe-T-Sport Hinged Knee Brace, Neoprene",0/0,4.0,Helps with a weak knee from an old injury. Provides good support and we got a very good price. At least 20% below the cost at the local chain drug store.
4850,Bachmann Trains Thomas with Annie and Clarabel Ready-to-Run HO Scale Train Set,0/1,1.0,"Bought this for my grandson, what a piece of high price crap ! will not stay on track no matter what you do. The cheap engine and cars are too light."
4851,Cane Holder in Black,0/0,5.0,Does exactly what it's supposed to....Ordered this for a friend and she loves it. Should have ordered more so I would have them when I see a need.
4852,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,5.0,Worked really well. One drop made a HUGE difference in the product. This tiny bottle is going to last me a long time.
4853,Barnie's CoffeeKitchen Santa's White Christmas (12oz Ground),1/1,5.0,"There are other coffee companies out there who create their own Christmas Blend, but nothing can compare to Barnie's Santa's White Christmas. It has been a family tradition to have this in the house for the last 10 years and we were heartbroken when the local Barnie's closed in our mall. Thank goodness we can still purchase it on line!!!"
4854,AmeriColor Gel Paste,0/0,5.0,Worked really well. One drop made a HUGE difference in the product. This tiny bottle is going to last me a long time.

4856,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,5.0,"I love the Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles, and this bundle offered a great selection of puzzles for a great price."
4857,Svan Signet Chair Cushion,0/0,3.0,"We own two of these as we have 2 Svan chairs. I love the color and they are comfortable. However, they get dirty quick (or maybe my kids are the only messy eaters) so they get washed about once a week (maybe a little less). The more you wash them, the less functional the velcro becomes (even if you hook it all together before washing). We rarely dry them (unless we're in a hurry) and they do well but have definitely shown wear in the year we've had it."
4858,Nature's Gate Rainwater Shampoo,0/0,2.0,It is very thick and like jello coming out of the bottle. I have not noticed any difference in my hair except that it is more difficult to comb after washing.
4859,"Mentholatum Natural Ice Lip Protectant SPF 15, Cherry Flavor, 0.16-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,The ladies in my family wait all year for this Christmas Gift. It is the only Lip protection any of us will use. We have tried may other products but this is the one they all want. Light cherry flavor and is as smooth as silk when on. And protects til you wipe it off. I would give it 10 stars if I could!
4860,"Pamela's Products Raisin Walnut Cookies, 6.52-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,Very well packaged. Arrived safely. Love the product! Really yummy cookie for the Oatmeal Raisin cookie lovers whether or not you're avoiding gluten.
4861,Men's 4 Alarm Talking Watch and Date,0/0,1.0,I ordered this watch for my blind father for a christmas gift. When I received it yesterday the watch had a mark on it and its defective. It turned on but it doesn't work at all. I'm very disappointed with this product and am still waiting for a response from the seller.
4862,Ultimate Touch Super Nail Clipper,0/0,5.0,I bought these clippers to use on puppy pit and miniature golden retriever. They are definitely easy to use and worthy of 5 stars! The best feature is the safety latch to protect busy fingers and paws when not in use. They are sharp and precise with a clean cut. Customer service was great with super fast ship to delivered time.
4863,"Natural Factors Lung, Bronchial and Sinus Health Tablets, 90-Count",1/1,3.0,I've been taking this for a few weeks now and I honestly can't say I've noticed any results. I still have a sinus infection although not as bad. Probably won't buy this again.
4864,Ortho Molecular Product Natural D-Hist -- 120 Capsules,0/0,5.0,"I work at a public school, so I'm surrounded by people with viruses. I developed a horrible cold in October, which lasted over a month. MD's visits and OTC meds were worthless. After using Ortho's D-Hist (plus the SinuPulse Elite Advanced Nasal Sinus Irrigation System), I got better quickly.The real test came about three days ago, when I started feeling a cold coming on again. After taking D-Hist again immediately, three days later feeling 100% again. Highly recommend."
4865,Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game,0/0,5.0,My 9 year old is obsessed with LOTR so when I find these sets on sale I snatch them up! Great sets!

4867,Star Wars Power of the Force Electronic Power F/X Action Figure - Luke Skywalker with Glowing Lightsaber and Remote Dueling Action,0/0,5.0,"Although this is an older figure from the late 1990's, it still has some very cool features. It connects to the Electronic Power F/X Darth Vader, and holds a background of the Emperor's Throne Room on the back of its card. Put together with Vader, it creates a pretty cool mini-diorama.You may observe that Luke wears a cape, which is admittedly not in the movie, but it still looks good.Due to its battery, there is limited articulation, but unlike some of the newer figures with light-up features, the batteries on THIS figure, as well as Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, R2-D2, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, from the Power of the Force Electronic Power F/X line, are replaceable. While these figures may not be top of the line, they are still very cool, and worth the money."
4868,Seachem Prime 500ml,0/0,5.0,"You can't beat the quality of Seachem products. Seachem Prime is the best water treatment you can buy. It is a stress reducer and it helps your fish's slime coat. It reduces nitrate and nitrite levels so if you get a spike this will help. It removes chlorine and clorimines and everything else you don't want your fish in. A tiny cap full will treat 50 gallons!!! So 1 bottle will last nearly forever. If you want healthy fish this is the one to get.Prime teamed up with &#34;Seachem Stability&#34; which is a bio filter bacteria concoction that is not only a tank starter to prevent new tank syndrome, &#34;massive die off&#34; of fish but it helps break down waste also."
4869,"Sporn Pet Halter, Large, Black",0/0,5.0,"This halter is easy to put on too. From the first time I used it, the dog walked nicely on the leash."
4870,Yu Gi Oh Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon Limited Edition Foil Trading Card,0/0,5.0,A limited edition card making it an excellentaddition to any Yu Gi Oh playing card deck.My son really liked this card.
4871,"Wellington Stoned Wheat Cracker, 10.6 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,Like the crackers. Like the ingredients list. Only complaint is they tend to break rather than crack along serations. This is probably largely a function of the lack of bad fats and low overall fat content. I'll take the cracking issue over higher fat level every time.
4872,37-Key Elite Baby Grand - Black,0/0,4.0,"We bought this for our nieces. For whatever reason I had the unrealistic expectation that this was going to sound almost like a full size piano. It doesn't. It is a kids piano that looks and sounds like a kids piano. My nieces love it and have started learning how to play. Great product, just be smarter than I am and have realistic expectations when you purchase it."
4873,Scrabble Express Handheld,0/0,2.0,"This product was hard to use, very slow and had no directions. Boought for a gift and is not used."
4874,Tomy Pop-Up Pirate Game,0/0,5.0,I got this for my grandson. It is a Christmas gift so it has not been opened yet. I am sure he will love it since he loves pirates.
4875,Nature's Way Kelp -- 100 Capsules,0/0,4.0,"Recently, I started taking these tablets given the documented anti-inflammatory properties of kelp. As many other variables have changed, it is impossible to ascribe any positive benefits to this product. If you Google top anti-inflammatory products, kelp generally makes the top ten list. Currently I am taking all ten (or more) and the results have been positive."
4876,Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),0/0,1.0,"I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!"
4877,"Digestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support, 96 Counts Capsules",1/1,5.0,"Works, fixed my constipation issues due to post-infectious IBS-C, relieves bloating and cramping. Does the job with no side effects vs miralax and MoM.Small price to pay for a return of quality to my life."
4878,"Universal Nutrition Animal Pak Sports Nutrition Supplement, 44-Count",0/0,5.0,"I'm new to the animal pak products but I must say I don't have any plans switching to any other products soon. It really has you feeling great and healthy. I'm able to work full time and still have energy and health to workout before and after work (cardio and weight training). I will soon receive Animal Cuts and I'll see how that product goes for me. I highly recommend taking any Animal Pak products, this company has been around for quite some time so you know that their products work if they're still one of the top brands after such a long time. Yes, this product consists of taking a lot of pills a day but honestly no need to be scared of digesting too many pills that are healthy for you, many people digest harmful stuff to their body everyday, so by taking these 11-22 pills a day won't hurt but will help you."
4879,"Duracell D389/390PK Watch / Electronics Battery, 1.5 Silver Oxide",1/1,3.0,Of the two batteries one worked fine but one was very weak right out of the package. The items arrived quickly.

4884,India Tree Natural Decorating Colours,0/0,5.0,I liked using these food colorings to decorate my sugar cookies!We made a burgandy red color by mixing red into the green.The icing tasted good. No aftertaste like some other food colorings have.
4885,Hylands Ipecacuanha,0/0,1.0,Very disappointed in this product. The cost is high for it not to work.would like to have a refund
4886,Seachem Flourish 500ml,1/1,5.0,A must have for your planted aquarium. SeaChem's best product for aquarium plants in my book. Does it's job well. I've ordered many different SeaChem products and none have come leaking fluid or miss handled. I only buy my SeaChem products on Amazon. A lot cheaper than in store and never had any shipping problems.
4887,TetraFin Flakes,0/0,5.0,good product. size is really big. my fish love it... price is really really good for me than store. like

4890,NatraBio Arnica Cream The Rub,1/1,5.0,I had sprained my pinky playing hockey and for about 3 months I would continuously re-injure it over and over. I had almost excepted that my pinky was never going to heal and I would have to keep it wrapped forever. Using the cream my pinky has completely healed in record time. Arnica is amazing.
4891,"Marshalls Creek Spices Marshalls Creek Spices Meat Tenderizer, No Salt, 1 Count",2/2,1.0,"I ordered this product [from DoC] based on the comments from folks who received lemon peel, the picture and of course, the listed ingredients; both of which clearly state ""Lemon Peel."" What I received was the title product ""Meat Tenderizer Seasoning, No Salt."" Some kind of spice blend that was devoid of any lemon, peel or otherwise.Amazon issued a refund and the rep who processed the refund acknowledged the mistake in the listing. Unfortunately, as of today (two weeks later), 12/23/2012, the title, the product image and the listed ingredients are STILL incompatible.I don't know HOW the other commentators received actual lemon peel by ordering this product, unless the merchant picks which item to ship [lemon peel or tenderizer seasoning] according to the moon and stars. Placing an order on faith could be a gamble... Better to see a tarot reader for a forecast before taking the chance."
4892,"BioNeurix Seredyn Capsules, 60-Count",0/0,5.0,"I woke one morning with the jitters, like I drank too much coffee on an empty stomach which I hadn't. Of course I brought that up on the computer and it seems I'm not the only person that's had this, they are calling it axiety. Someone said they take Seredyn and it's natural so that was something I would be interested in. I purchased it and boy it takes the edge off. The doctor wanted to give me a Rx I said no this works great. Hoping if this is anxiety it goes away soon else this situation is making me have anxiety. Bottom line I will keep purchasing Seredyn for as long as I need it."
4893,Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,Awesome product . Got this and I absolutely love it . this is my second one as the first one I had i lost it .. Will buy again.. Awesome
4894,Toppik Hair Building Fibers,0/0,5.0,"I have been using this product for over a year now, and I recommend it to anyone that has thin hair on the top of the head. The color blends in well with my own haircolor, and it adds body and texture to my own thin strands. I do try and add a side part using a thin comb or pick in order to obtain a more natural look, otherwise it can sometimes look like a wig without a natural hairpart.I am a young woman, and without this product I would probably go back to feeling very self -conscience and uncomfortable in public."
4895,65th Birthday Gift Box 1948- Retro Candy,0/0,4.0,"This arrived quickly and is quite a nice walk down memory lane in terms of the candies from that year, but it is a LOT of candy. I think they could improve this by adding a couple more non-candy small items or copies of articles."
4896,Eminence Organics Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer,0/0,5.0,"I was searching for a while for quality skincare products that are worth the money and also last the money, I found that with eminence. My skin is very sensitive and pretty much every moisturizer out there would cause break outs or rashes with the exception of Wexler skincare for acne. I received a trial size of the eight greens moisturizer and tried it thinking for sure I would break out because of the creamy thickness. To my amazement NOPE! No breakouts and daily use will make your skin look smoother and brighter. Try the Hungarian mud treatment! It is hot but you can see a huge difference the next day!"
4897,Ezy-Dose Ezy-Dose 7-Day 7-Sided Pill Reminder Medium,0/0,5.0,"Great if you have more than one or two pills to take every day.... I have to take meds in the PM as well, so I have a green Pill Reminder for my evening meds.... these containers hold five plus pills, depending on size.... plenty of room in each compartment..... Hard to find this type of container at retail stores......"
4898,WEN by Chaz Dean Fig Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz,0/0,3.0,For the money this cost its not worth it. My hair feels drier at times. I would not buy this again.

4901,Thyroid Support 90 Tablets,2/2,5.0,The best product in the world to loose weight while you feed you thyroid. Your thyroid controls your whole body.
4902,Gazillion Bubble Machine,0/0,5.0,"Highly recommend this gift for any child, especially an Autistic one so you no longer have to worry about them getting dizzy blowing bubbles or you getting dizzy having to blow bubbles for your child. ;) Recommend obtaining bubble refills at dollar tree and stock up when they have them because they do not always carry them."
4903,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,5.0,I liked this movie for it's innovation as far as a blend of comedy and horror. Though Michael Keaton is never too scary!
4904,Simplee Cleen Household Swivel Mop Microfiber Damp Scrub Pad,0/0,2.0,I don't really care for these products compared to rubbermaid. The microfiber doesn't pick up as much as the rubbermaid brand and that is definitely a problem
4905,"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack",0/0,5.0,"The brushes are great for sticking into and twisting in small glass tubing. The handles can be bent easily with your hand to guide the brush around curves, but it is not flexible enough to go beyond one 90 degree angle. It would be nice to find these with a longer handle, but I have rigged up a long handle of my own. Very good product!"
4906,Carlson Labs Norwegian Cod Liver Oil,0/0,5.0,This stuff is really great....it does not taste like fish; just has a nice lemon taste without being too powerful.
4907,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,i use this and revelutin they both are wonderful product but revelution helps with ear mites and worms so if you have a cute little stray that needs a bit more care i would use revelution but after three months i put them on frontline do to the savings
4908,"Ever Clean Extra Strength Cat Litter, Unscented, 25-Pound Box",0/0,5.0,"I was living with 2 cats and 1 litter box in a tiny Manhattan apartment. In desperation I asked the guy at my pet supply store (you know Sammy, who plays guitar on a stool outside the shop on warm evenings, on Christopher across from the Hangar?) what was absolutely the best litter. He pointed me straight to Ever Clean. Yes, it's expensive, and I don't know anything about the environmental impacts of clay litter. But here's how it works:It quickly absorbs all the liquid from solid waste, leaving bone-dry, aroma-free little pellets. It forms large, firm clumps of liquid waste, which scoop out easily without crumbling. Somehow the clumps always reside below the dry surface. There simply is no odor. Currently I'm in a larger home, still with 2 cats, with the box in an open area just a few feet from my TV chair. I am, I admit, not very good about cleaning the box. Yet there simply is no odor. It's amazing.In short, the only reason to buy litter this expensive is that it works much better than any other brand. And it does."
4909,Apex Apex Pill Splitter,0/0,5.0,"sharp, accurate, effective. Does the job. Nothing more to say. Ten more words are required, but not needed. Another two."
4910,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,I've had so many compliments on this coat! X-small fit my chihuahua perfect. He's 6 pounds. Keeps him so warm and he loves it! Looks adorable.
4911,Pantene Ice Shine Shampoo,1/1,5.0,"I was curses/blessed with hair that started turning silver while still in high school. Other products turn my hair a sickly yellow. This shampoo does not. It lets the silver shine and it even makes it shinier. If I have to have prematurely silver hair, I'm glad that this product makes it look its best."
4912,Duro-Med Exercise Pulley Set,0/0,5.0,"Easy to use, cord has to be shortened for hanging over the door. Moves very smoothly and easy to put together."
4913,"Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Garlic & Herb, 0.75-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"My wife and I started on a low carb, high veggie - fish/chicken/beef - diet - this dressing is fantastic over our salad -- the mixture is great for a healthy body -- and love the taste -- will order again -- Gratitude, Bob"
4914,The First Years Sit and Store Parent Bathing Seat and Stepstool,0/0,5.0,"Great stool and provides storage. I have one in each bathroom and my soon uses it all the time. Even filled with bath toys, my son finds it easy to move."
4915,Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug,0/0,5.0,"My kids love these!!! I have a small for my 14 month old and a large for my almost 3 year old. The small size is definitely better suited for my younger child, although I have also seen her successfully riding the larger toy. Probably you could get away with the larger size for a 1 year old and they would grow into it pretty quickly. It took my 14 month old a few weeks to figure out how to climb on this thing and move it around the house. She is not walking yet but can scoot around very quickly on the wheely bug! If you are not sure what gift to get a 1-2 year old, this is it! I am pretty sure they will continue to play with them for a few years."
4916,"Licefreee non-toxic lice killing hair gel with steel comb - 4 oz, 2 pack",0/0,4.0,Not sure which I think works better this one or their spray but they both work worlds better than the useless chemicals. No greesy mess either.
4917,American Outdoor Products Astronaut Ice Cream (Pack of 10),0/0,4.0,My kids love this stuff. No idea why. My only gripe is wish it was a little cheaper for the amount you get.
4918,Amazon.com,0/0,3.0,"I bought this bag for my son for Christmas. I opened the package upon delivery and was pleasantly surprised to see this toiletry bag came in a really nice sturdy box with the name Royce on the outside. This leather bag itself seems to be bulky and heavy, and the zipper is somewhat difficult around the ends or folds of the bag. Let's see what my son thinks on Christmas day. The jury is out!"
4919,FCUK her - EDT Spray 3.4 oz. (Womens),0/0,5.0,I used to own this fragrance back in 2005. It was a very special gift with a funny story. I wanted to have it again and ordered this one. I must say it took me back to the day I was presented it as a gift. Thanks a bunch. Keep it in stock!!
4920,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,5.0,"I decided for myriad reasons to go back to DE shaving about 3 months ago. My first purchase was the Merkur 180 and it has become the standard by which I now judge other razors. Paired with Feather blades and using a 3 pass method this razor gives an extraordinary shave.I since have collected over 20 vintage Gillette razors and, so far, the only ones that may rival the Merkur are my Fat Boys( 1960 & 1961), Gold Aristocrat (1953), and perhaps my Super Speed Flare Tip red(1955) and my 1966 Slim Adjustable. Of course I haven't tried them all yet.The Merkur is nicely weighted, feels good in your hand, and gives an excellent reproducible shave. It seems to work as well on one days growth as on 2 or 3.If I had to pick just one razor to use this would be it. As an aside, do yourself a little luxury and pick up an alum block( I like the Razor Rock) to soothe and close your pores after shaving. As for shave Cream, so far I have used Proraso for sensitive skin and Taylor of Old Bond St. Both excellent products when applied with a decent badger brush.In sum, you can pay more but I'm not sure you can get a much better shave than this."
4921,Tiptree Tawny Thick cut Marmalade 12oz Jar,0/2,3.0,it does not have the taste that i expected. i like the smuckers taste better. this has a different texture and color. i cannot say it is bad because i am not use to it. their lemon curd is great

4927,EarthStone Bathstone Cleaning Block,0/1,2.0,"I am disappointed with this little cleaning stone, having read the reviews and weighed my decision to buy, considering the cost and expectations.The cleaning block dissolves quickly and you must use a LOT of elbow grease to try and achieve the anticipated results.I rubbed. Little change. I rubbed again. Sigh.I will not be purchasing again."
4928,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Fish Bowl Jumbo Knob Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"This type of knob puzzle was recommended for my granddaughter to bolster very early fine motor skill development.

4929,Haribo Color-Rado Gummi Candy / 200g / 7.1oz.,0/0,1.0,The listing for this candy says it is gluten free. It is NOT. It contains wheat flour. This candy has made me sick. I trusted the Amazon listing instead of the fine print in German. If you need to eat gluten free do not buy this
4930,Roux Fanci-full Rinse #26 Golden Spell,1/1,5.0,"I chose this rating because the item was exactly as described by the seller.In addition, this item covers gray very well, and lasts until my hair is washed.The product is easy to apply. It is a litte runny, however, I do not have a problem with that. You can apply with a cotton ball if necessary and dab it on.I would recommend this product to anyone with blonde hair and gray roots."

4934,"Conair Instant Heat Dual Voltage Flat Iron 2"" Ceramic Straightener",0/0,1.0,"Ordered the Conair Flat Iron 2"" Ceramic Straightener - Dual Voltage.Because it was SUPPOSED to have an attachable comb with it... It came up in the search for straightener with a comb and a comb was discussed in the reviews.... Yet I see no comb. The comb was the ONLY reason that i had bought it. My time and Christmas has been wasted. Thanks amazon."
4935,Natural Selection Bath and Body's 1/3 oz Fragrance Oil,0/0,5.0,A small bottle of gardenia essential oil at a reasonable cost instead of a large amount at a higher cost or just a blended oil. Now I can follow simple recipes for basic fragrance.
4936,Uglydoll Classic Plush Doll,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely loved it ! My girlfriend collects these, and it's GREAT quality and it shipped in lightning speeds.

4942,Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads,0/0,3.0,"One of the issues is that it folds or comes off sometimes after nursing. During sleep also it gets crunched up and have to readjust at times. Other than that, this a decent product, stays dry enough for at least 10-12 hours (but that of course depends on how much on leaks). I use this one most of the time."
4943,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,I am very unhappy with these diapers. I usually purchase Pampers Cruisers but this was such a good deal and being named BABY DRY! They leak everynight!!
4944,Canus Goats Milk Lip Balm,0/0,3.0,"Organic balm, hence the extra $$$. Don't know if it's worth it. Creamy, sometimes it breaks off. Not too happy about the formula. I really don't like &#34;white&#34; formulas. I prefer &#34;clear&#34; balms."
4945,Zanies Laser Beam Mouse Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,My cat and I really love the laser toy. No matter what she is doing she'll stop and and play when I use the laser. She gets exercise and there is nothing to tear up. It's just great!
4946,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,3.0,"Price seemed inordinately high for a simple squeegee, and the handle is too short to be of much use.. It would be nice to have an adjustable handle, sort of like a Swifter Duster."
4947,SW Express Geyser Blast Sprinkler,0/0,1.0,What a piece of junk! This is a complete waste of money. Ours broke within seconds of hooking it up. Whoever designed this should find a new job. Save your kids the disappointment.Amazon should stop selling this product.
4948,"Marineland PC0250HSB H.O.T. Magnum 250, up to 55-Gallon, 250GPH",0/0,2.0,"Broken magnet. I have three of these canisters, and although they are marginal as filters, they work great if you use a prefilter on the intake., this one arrived with a broken magnet. Box was intact, so it left the factory like that.I have ordered another magnet. Not worth haggling over shipping back."
4949,Nature's Answer White Willow,1/1,5.0,I bought this product for a couple reasons
4950,L-Arginine Powder by Now Foods 1 lb.,0/0,5.0,"If you are taking L-Arginine I recommend buying the 2.2 pound tub 1 Kilo size. It saves money and the powder is much more potent than the pills, and this size will last about 6 months."
4951,Analgesic Gel Flexall 454 Pain Relieving Gel 4 Oz,0/0,1.0,"I had used this product in other packages and it was ok, but this tube dispenses a large amount of product each time and is uncontrollable. If you really want this product I would get a different package. I went back to using Perrigo Trolamine Salicylate 10% as it has no odor and works better."
4952,Log Splitter,0/0,1.0,The log splitter was a very great compliment to the Truck. My grandson was very inpressed with the 'workings' of it all.
4953,Carrom 042.01 Nok-Hockey Equipment Set,0/0,5.0,Getting extra sticks and pucks is a good inexpensive insurance policy in case the pucks or the sticks get lost.
4954,Masc-A-Gray Auburn 105,1/1,5.0,"This is a very good product. It is mascara for your roots. It washes out and the customized colors blend nicely with the rest of your hair. When you can't get to the salon or don't have time to touch up your color at home, try this. It works!"
4955,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,I really like the pet fountain. Easy assembly. Both cats drink from it and at least now I know that they are getting enough water. This is our 2nd purchase of this fountain.
4956,Nature's Way Dong Quai,0/0,5.0,"I used to use this, have recommended it to teens with menstrual problems for years and now my daughter uses it. It works well if you have issues with cramps. They key is to remember to take it EVERY DAY."
4957,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,0/0,5.0,Our cat cant' get enough of play with this. The long wand and string make it easy to move the feather long distances and very fast along the floor where our orange tabby loves to chase it.

4959,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"My son brought his Lab puppy over and he loved this toy. From the first squirrel he was so entertained by this toy. He played with the squirrels, chased them, chewed on them, put them in the stump, took them out and just had a great time. He would even carry the stump around with the squirrels in it. If you have a dog, or puppy (or know someone who does) this is the toy they will love!!!"
4960,Duro-Med Mealtime Protector,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this bib for my mother, who had purchased one a year before. A must for those people who have somedifficulty feeding themselves but it also great for anybody. After a year of wear and washing, it is still in very great condition. The Velcro closure at the neck is very easy for my mother who has arthritis. It is long and wide enough to protect your clothes. The ""One Size Fits All"" is perfect for my mom who is a larger than smaller. Amazon price was a value, but at any price I would highly recommend."
4961,Conair WJT4BCR Interplak 4 Piece Water Jet Tips,0/0,1.0,"I stopped using them and went back to floss after using it for 6 months and my dentist did not have nice things to say about my gums. (Run on sentence) With floss, I am much better"
4962,Classic Stainless Steel Dog Bowl,0/0,5.0,"I honestly paid more for these through Amazon than I could've bought them for at Walmart, but I kept forgetting to pick them up when I was out & my dogs had destroyed their old bowls. They're just exactly what I wanted - standard, no-frills, no-design, no-plastic-parts stainless steel food bowls for my dogs. The finish seems to be holding up well after weeks of outdoor used, and the thickness and overall build quality is satisfactory."
4963,Uncle Milton Moon In My Room,0/0,4.0,"Really cool, I bought it for my 5 year old nephew along with the Glow in the Dark solar system. Product came as described, quickly. As soon as he uses it I will update my review. Thus far I am pleased."
4964,3-D Mirascope,0/0,5.0,Interesting for people to think a coin is floating on the top when it's not. Great for office desks or even in a classroom. Science toys are fun and mind boggling!
4965,Hot Stuff Hot Stuff Glue 1 oz HOTHS-7,0/0,4.0,"i actually bought this glue for an extra strong hold for paper to paper and it didn't stick at all. although on the description it did not say it would stick to paper, it didn't say it wouldn't either :o/ i haven't tried it on any other material in which i'm sure it does what it says, but if you're looking for a glue for paper go with crazy or super glue ;o)"
4966,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/0,4.0,"My baby likes it. She likes the colors and the toys hanging on it. One small thing - currently at age of 2.5 months, she kind of leans on one side in the rocking position - could be baby specific but could also be how the seat is shaped."
4967,Cincher Women's Posture Back Brace Support Belt - Tan - Medium,0/0,4.0,"This is a great back support. I was a little skeptical about ordering it sight unseen, but I have no regrets. It fits smoothly under my clothing and I can wear it without worry of it bunching under my dress. Most importantly my back feels much better when I am wearing it for support."
4968,"Good Earth Chai Tea, 18 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",0/0,5.0,Thought I would try Chai tea. Found out I don't really care for it. I do drink many teas but chai is not for me.

4970,"E-Flite Complete Body Set, Red",0/0,5.0,"This is a replacement body for the tail end that I broke. But the helicopter itself is a great product. However, start small when it comes to RC helicopters. They are tricky and it takes practice to master the skills as I found out the hard way."
4971,Masters Of The Universe Battle Sound He-Man Figure w/Video,0/0,5.0,"Good quality, surviving a 4 year old, great detail. Looks just like the television show. Weapons are sturdy. Stands on its own."
4972,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"This by far is the BEST popcorn taste you will get for your machine. The only odd thing is directions on the popcorn differ slightly from those on the machine....& they are both the same name brand, LOL.Not only does this popcorn taste the best, it never gets chewy like some of the other brands. Not sure how or why.The salt portion in the packet is a little too much for me, so I only add 1/2.I will ONLY buy this brand from now on.Enjoy!!!"
4973,"Naturade Herbal Expectorant (EXPEC II), with Guaifenesin, Licorice Flavor, Sugar Free , 8.8 Fluid Ounces (260 ml)",0/0,5.0,"Without the harmful chems, this works like a charm. My husband started coughing up all of the phlegm on his chest the next day. Give it a day to work and it will surprise you. He said it takes like Robitussin but more herbal. It does contain alcohol so if you don't want that, you can go with the kids version and double the dose. Happy."
4974,Quickie #0764 Mighty Mop Mitt Refill,0/0,3.0,"After Lowe's stopped carrying the refills I found these online. They are OK, but not as thick or absorbant as the ones I bought in store. Don't know if they are the same brand. Also noticed that 2 of the 3 I bought online are really hard to stretch over the mop base; they seem a little small."
4975,Into the Blue Eau de Parfum for Women by Escada,0/0,5.0,"Into the blue,a fragrance by Escada.The perfume is light and sexy.I love it! I have trouble selecting a fragrance that is good on my skin.This is great!"
4976,"Learning Resources Fruit & Vegetable Play Food Basket, Set of 13",0/0,4.0,"The food is fun to play with and is very realistic looking, but each piece is a little big for pretend eating. Love the basket that the food comes in."
4977,Slingshot Flying Monkey With Scream Sound,0/0,2.0,It was a gift and the first time they launched it across the room the hand fell off. Poorly made.
4978,"Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz",4/5,1.0,"I dunno. It's kind of OK. But when you come right down to it, I quite frankly prefer a Super Tuscan."
4979,"Welch Allyn, 72200 Battery By TITAN",0/0,5.0,It meets my expectations and costs less than the genuine battery.Ich habe das Produkt aus Deutschland bestellt.und kann es empfehlen. Der einzige Nachteil ist die etwas l&auml;ngere Lieferdauer.

4981,BareMinerals Eye Shadow,0/0,5.0,"I am in my upper fifties, so bright eye colors are not an attractive option for me! This soft pink is a light color that I use as a neutral shadow that brightens up my upper lids (which tends to disappear with darker & taupe colors.) I use the darker colors (with a light touch) in the crease of my lid. Then I accent my eyes with a little smidgeon of white in both corners of my eyes and a dot in the middle of the lid & blend - it makes my eyes sparkle & the whites look a little brighter. I find that using a subtle shade of eyeliner in teal, deep forest green or charcoal are just the right amount of color to bring out my hazel eyes and looks nice with my silver hair! At this age, less is more - Really!"
4982,United Cutlery UC2723 Metal Glo Polishing Paste,0/0,3.0,"I tried this stuff on my beloved (is that the right word, lol) ancient carbon steel Asian cleaver.After probably too much elbow grease, it looked maybe 30% better.If the rust (and other) stains really start bothering me, I'll probably take it to my polishing wheel instead.In a way, I don't mind the rustic (rusted) look. Plus it doesn't smell like the compound for a while after as I'm chopping up food."
4983,"Aveeno Active Naturals Creamy Moisturizing Oil, 12 Ounce",2/2,5.0,"I'm stationed near the North Pole, it's not a very humid place, so whatever I thought I knew about dry skin, chapped lips, and winterburn, I've had to forget and learn from scratch. With -80 windchill and 175 mph winds, skin care is an absolute must here. I trust Aveeno, it works, it doesn't feel like oil or plastic, it has that familiar oatmeal scent. One application after a morning shower and shave and i'm good to go all day."
4984,Dickinsons Dickinsons Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner,0/0,5.0,"I can't say much that hasn't been said. To speak to the scent/odor, I'm not particularly a fan, but it's not bad enough to keep me from using it. Has really helped my complexion and evened out the skin tone."
4985,Bath Buzz Caffeinated Soap,1/2,5.0,"Unfortunately I don't have a review for the product as I bought it for a stocking stuffer, (she seemed to love it though). However, if you do buy this, make sure it is from Chemical Evolutions. Shortly after I had bought the product I noticed that estimated delivery date was the 27th, obviously this wouldn't work. I contacted them about my concerns and they let me know that they would take care of me. They upped the shipping and got it here December 24th.... BEAUTIFUL. They even sent a hand written note ""Hope you got it in time, Happy Holidays from Chemical Evolutions"""

4988,Earth Henna Earth Henna Body Painting Kit Original,0/0,5.0,Got it for our 11 year old. She loves it. My 21 year old did one also. Seems to be plenty of ingredients for quite a few more.

4990,Peelu Toothpowder Plain 2.50 Ounces,0/0,2.0,Plain indeed. I thought the taste was insipid with a yuck factor. I had to stop using it. I am sure it works fine if used.
4991,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,Cozy and very easy to put on. Fits my two Maltese perfectly; 5.7 lbs and 5.2 lbs. I recommend it highly.
4992,Energizer 2025BP-2 Lithium Button Cell Battery (2 Count),0/0,5.0,"These are batteries. The price can't be beat. I used this to replace a dead battery on my Timex Ironman watch. It fit as needed, now i can swim with it and see how long my laps take."
4993,Stroopwafels - 20 Dutch Caramel Syrup Waffle Cookies,0/0,4.0,"I am very happy with this order, arrived quickly AND none were broken! The Stroopwafels taste delicious and go great with my tea or coffee. Hopefully I will get to share these at a tea party soon!"
4994,"POOF-Slinky 300L Ideal Frontier Logs Classic All Wood Construction Set with Action Figures and Sealed Storage Box, 300-Pieces",0/0,3.0,My son was given this set as a Christmas gift. It was missing the 6 triangle pieces needed to put the roof on. I'm going to try an contact the company to see if they'll send me the missing parts.
4995,Small World Toys Activity (It's a Party Tea Set) 8,0/0,4.0,Cute and fun! I got this for my niece and she has had hours of fun play time with it.
4996,Ball Bounce & Sport Fun Hopper,0/0,1.0,I bought this for my 4 year old nephew but it better suits his 1 year old baby sister! Far too small for anyone over 3! I'm buying him a new one that is of an appropriate diameter.
4997,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,One of the best gifts given this Christmas. I ordered the blue/green lady bug and the green turtle dreamlites. My grandaughter and grandson each loved them! I would recommend for the ages of 5/6. A really good gift.
4998,Radio Flyer Little Red Wagon,0/0,2.0,"I guess I should have read the product description more carefully. I was looking for a wagon that my daughter could carry her toys in, but instead, it's not big enough to carry much of anything. I will be returning this and looking for something bigger."
4999,Thai Deodorant Stick 4.25 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I initially treated this product as a curious novelty. However, I have found it to be amazingly effective! I definitely prefer it over traditional deodorant. It is odorless when applied; I have stayed odor-free even after the sweatiest nights out dancing.I have bought this product for others to try, and i know that they are happy to make the switch as well. At this price, it is worth trying for yourself."
5000,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,This is a very good dog jacket. Bought it for our new Goldendoodle puppy. Went ahead and bought the large. It is a little big but he will grow into it quickly. Only complaint was there was not enough sizing information on the product description. Looked through the reviews and someone was nice enough to put on the sizes. The product is great. Usually these things are cheap looking but this actually has some sturdiness to it. Would recommend.
5001,Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine,1/1,5.0,"Performs as advertised. Worked well on my cold. Handled my congestion well-enough to let me sleep. What can I say, it's Alka-Seltzer, a product we've known for years."
5002,"Bali's Best Espresso Candy, 5.3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,Found these at Wholefoods but since Wholefoods is a ways away I was glad to be able to order them online. It was quick and they came in when they said they would. I have given quite a few of them away and they are really enjoyed. Great flavor in a small candy.
5003,Avalon Organics Conditioner Strenthening Peppermint -- 11 fl oz,0/1,4.0,"These types of products are great marketing schemes. My hair hasn't retreated any further, but is that due to this product? Probably not. My review is based on the actual product not its claims.I use this conditioner combined with their Biotin B complex Shampoo. I can confirm that my hair feels matty after use, thicker might be an illusion. I like the way that my hair feels after 1-2 days of use. It combs well and I literally spend 1-2 minutes messing with it to get a good look.I highly recommend cycling between the two above and something like Coconut milk Shampoo/conditioner to maintain a balance between Thick/Matted and soft/flexible. I would NOT use this shampoo daily for more than 3 days consecutively, but then again everyones hair is different. If that wasnt the case we wouldnt need thickening shampoo :)"
5004,Prestige Kelly Straight Forceps,0/0,5.0,"just what I needed, will help me a lot when school starts again. this is something every nursing student should have."
5005,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"This is a good purchase, I have not had any issues with the scent being diluted or short-lived. It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!"
5006,27 Pc Cookware Playset - Primary,0/0,3.0,"It would be wonderful if the plastic were stronger or even a metal material!!!! More durable ad real looking would be woth a little extra money.....and to make the siverware metal would have been perfect......and how about adding colored plastic glasses, afterall, aren't glasses more familiar to a child than COFFEE CUPS!!!! I seached for weeks and weeks for a REALLY NICE table settings set and yours was the best I could find but not what I wanted."
5007,Ultra Stomp Rocket,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for Christmas for a 3yr and 4yr, it was on of their favorite toys. Heck I had as much fun with it as they did. I bought the ultra stomp version"
5008,Steve Spanglers Geyser Tube,0/0,4.0,Becuase I think that the geyser should be sold without mentos in the same package. I will buy it again.
5009,Rusk Smoother Passionflower & Aloe Leave-In Texturizing Conditioner (select option/size),0/0,4.0,This is a good product. The only thing is that its a see as you go product. You will have to play around with different amts until you find the right size amout for you to use. If you get to much in your hair it makes it extremely greasy
5010,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magic Set,0/0,5.0,"Good price, sturdy build, my 9 year old girl loved it. Has good tricks especially for 6-12 yrs would def recommend."
5011,360 Black Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,the packaging and design is excellent. what I expected and meets loa offer made. I arrive on time. happy with the purchase
5012,Melissa & Doug Pattern Blocks and Boards,0/0,5.0,THis is a neat toy and fun to learn colors and shapes. My boys don't love them but maybe because they are boys. I would buy again if my boys played with them more.
5013,Today's Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow,0/0,5.0,My daughter is in her 2nd trimester and is starting to feel some hip pain. This pillow has been a welcome relief for her sweet...yet expanding body. She said she can move it around to fit her ever-changing shape. She also said that its great support while watching tv and looks forward to using it as a support pillow when the baby is born!
5014,Melissa & Doug First Shapes Jumbo,0/0,5.0,"This is a great puzzle! My son got it when he was really little and the big pieces were great for banging and making noise. As he got older, he loved getting the pieces in the puzzle. The big pieces and big knobs were easy for him to do this by the time he was 1 yr old. Then as the puzzle was too easy, we used the puzzle to identify the names of each of the shapes. Excellent starter puzzle for 6 months to 3 years!"
5015,FootSmart Bunion Regulator,1/1,4.0,"I own two of these, one for each foot. Overall, I find that they work really well in alleviating foot pain, so long as you use them consistently. I would wear them each night right before going to bed - initially starting with a very loose fit, but over time making the velcro just a little tighter to help correct my foot problem. The problem is that sometimes the brace isn't very comfortable. On me, for some reason I don't feel as uncomfortable with my left foot in the brace as I do with my right - and what would happen is I'd wake up in the morning, and discover that in my sleep I'd kicked off or removed the right brace b/c it was bothering me. Somehow though I guess the left wasn't so annoying, because usually that one was still on. If you can manage to get a comfortable fit with this thing, it works well - but if it isn't comfortable, the truth is you probably won't wear it and/or benefit from it."
5016,Maxi Rub - MR-2 - 2-Speed Electric Professional Back Massager - Blue & White - 9 L x 4.5 W x 8 H,0/0,5.0,"I had bought my first Maxi Rub, the kind my chiropractor used and told me to get. It lasted for over 20 years. This one is lighter, and also has two speeds. It really helps to relieve pain and stiffness in my back."
5017,LUXOR Professional 7 1/2 inch Ice Tempered Barber Styling Shears (Model,1/1,5.0,Sharper blades for a more professional look. I hope these last a long time! They certainly beat using the children's scissors I was previously using to trim my husbands hair! He is a real good sport!
5018,"NatureMade/Pharmavite - Sam-E Double Strength, 400 mg, 36 tablets",0/0,5.0,I really don't know what I'd do without it. Nature Made's SAM-e is effective and reliable. A hundred times better than the prescription meds.
5019,Melissa & Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock,0/0,4.0,"This was purchased as a gift for my niece who is slightly below the recommended age of 3. She loves it when someone asks her for a color - she picks up the block, shows it to the person, and puts it back into place. I thought this would be a good toy for her to learn colors and numbers and later tell time. She seems to like it."
5020,Hylands Hylands Calms Forte Sleep Aid,0/0,4.0,I often have trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts. I have been prescribed
5021,Step 2 LifeStyle Dream Kitchen,0/0,4.0,The kitchen is really lacking in some areas of construction. As other readers have mentioned the oven door doesn't stay closed and the cabinet doors should have come with hinges and the pull out drawers should have had a catch on the baskets. My gripes are minor the biggest issue for me was I expected better quality for the price. It was time consuming but not too hard to put together. My 2yr old was up way past her bedtime playing with the kitchen on Christmas eve. It arrived on time with a broken light it was replaced and there was one screw missing. But the joy on my daughter's face is worth it. If you decide to buy this kitchen wait until you can get it at a deep discount.
5022,Caldrea Stainless Steel Spray Ginger Pomelo -- 16 fl oz,0/0,2.0,"This product leaves streaks on my stainless steel refrigerator. Disappointed, as most reviewers liked the product. Tried applying it with different types of clothes and in different ways but still not very successful."
5023,PURELL Sanitizing Hand Wipes Individually Wrapped 100-ct. Box,0/0,4.0,"The base paper is not as comfortable as Sani-hands. Liquid cleaner drips off of the sheet, as it is thinner than the cleaner on Sani-hands."
5024,Knex Value Tub 400 pieces,0/0,4.0,After opening the toy i realized that it was missing a lot of its pieces. It is a fun toy but i feel a bit ripped off considering it is supposed to be a 400 piece toy and we were only sent 100.
5025,"Hefty One Zip 2.5 Gallon Jumbo Storage/Freezer Bags,12 Count Boxes (Pack of 9)",0/0,1.0,"These bags are crap. Every time I've bought them, more than half the bags in the package are defective. They don't seal, like a bad zipper. You move the slider, and the bag opens right back up behind it.You ever tried transferring a 13 pound turkey and 6 cups of brine from one bag to another? It's a mess.On the other hand, if you enjoy getting brine and raw turkey juice all over the fridge and countertop, these are the bags for you."
5026,"Extra Coarse Sea Salt, 1 lb.",0/0,5.0,"We bought this to put into our lighted, electric, mill. It was the best thing we did, the flavor of the salt is much different than that of normal table salt."
5027,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"This is one of about 3 different trimmers we're currently using for our 2 small dogs' nails.I find that I need different cuts depending on circumstances, shape of nails, etc. This trimmer needs clearance all around the nail; room for the trimmer to work. For some nails I use a trimmer that meets at a point. But this is good maybe 80 to 90 percent of the time.Overall, it makes a nice clean cut. Recommended."
5028,Kneipp Herbal Body Washes - 6.8 oz. - Choose from 5 Styles,0/0,5.0,Found this in Paris & was unable to locate any at home in Texas. Big surprise. So found it on Amazon & now order it in bulk. It's great after a workout. Heats up the muscles & helps eliviate any soreness. Smells great too. Highly recommended.
5029,Cellaplex (360 Caps - 3 Bottles) Extra Strength Bone & Joint Support Formula w/ CM8,0/0,5.0,Wow I cannot believe that these pills has made me knee pain go away! I have tried every product on the market and nothing has done what these pills have done. I took the maximum dose daily and by the third week my knee pain was gone. I am so excited!
5030,Thera Cane Massager,0/0,4.0,"As long as you don't overdo it, the theracane is great. The trick is to push in one area, roll the knob, and then move to the next area and let your body do the work - feel the warm as blood flows to the area. The cane is apparently cast of strong fibers and plastic of some kind. Has a nice, smooth texture and while I don't totally care for the specific placement of the little knobs and nodules, they work very, very well. Last, I've seen these at doctors offices for $100 - the price on amazon is great since I would have never paid that for basically a piece of plastic, but $35 was great."
5031,Kalaya Emu Oil Moisturizing Shampoo - 17 oz,0/0,5.0,"so glad we bought this product! our dog was suffering before this shampoo, and we also ordered the emu oil spray. very good products!"
5032,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"We used the Pampers Swaddlers (NB and Size 1) prior to these. I ordered these thinking they were the next in the Size 2 line; however, our baby is constantly leaking and smells like pee immediately after a diaper change. We are going to switch back to the swaddlers and hope that solves the issue. They may cost a little more, but hoping they keep our daughter dry. Since she is only 13 pounds, there was no need to move her to size 3 as someone recommended. I would think twice before ordering the Baby Dry."
5033,Aquolina Pink Sugar,0/0,5.0,I love the scent of this product. Each time I wear it I am complimented over and over. I would recommend this scent to everyone.
5034,"Hyland's, Leg Cramps, 100 Tablets",0/0,5.0,"First, understand that I am a sixty year old man with a PhD and not prone to trying the latest trend in OTC cures nor the latest herbal wonder cure. I am a diabetic and suffer sever cramps (what we always called charley horses) in my calves and feet--most often waking me up in agony from a deep sleep. Thankfully (as it turns out) my wife is not so rigid and had tried these and repeatedly sung their praise. So the next time I had a terrible foot cramp, and rather than saw off my foot, I did as she said and put two of these tiny pills under my tongue to instantly dissolve. Literally in under two minutes the cramp was gone. Since that time I have a bottle on my nightstand and one in my briefcase. I want to never be without these. . . EVER. These are truly a wonder drug. The work so well that I am surprised some pharmaceutical has not copied them, registered a patent, and begun charging $100.00 a bottle! Maybe you better order them while you still can. Hmmmm, maybe I better order a case or two., Trust me. They work!"
5035,"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day All Purpose Cleaner, 32-Ounce Bottles (Case of 6)",0/0,5.0,We use this in our grooming shop and it really is a great product the geranium smell lasts which really helps.
5036,Flowerbomb,2/2,3.0,Product was delivered in original box. However special promo offer codes were removed from box with an exacto knife and the product was resealed. I guess I got what I paid for but I'm not sure how I feel about the product being opened and having some of the contents removed. And then having the item resealed to appear as if it had never been opened.
5037,Learning Resources Teaching Cash Register,0/0,1.0,"Does not work properly right out of the box. Very disappointing. Keeps saying ""drawer open"" when the drawer is completely shut. Will not operate or allow play due to ""drawer open"""
5038,"Rice Select Royal Blend, Whole Grain Texmati Brown & Wild Rice with Soft Wheat & Rye Berries, 28-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"We like the mix of the Wild Rice with Texmati. Two great rice's. The container is an appropriate size. We use it up quickly once open, so it stays fresh. Getting 3 at a time keeps us stocked up."
5039,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Folding Princess Castle,0/0,5.0,Its a beautiful castle. We got as a sturdier option for Calico Critters animals and love it! It is absolutely beautiful. And it will work well for the Calico Critter family we bought. Now we just need to buy some furniture.
5040,Met-Rx Big 100 Meal Replacement Bars 12 ea,0/0,5.0,Great for mid-day snacks and when you need a meal on the go. Met-RX has always had quality nutrition products.
5041,Thin-to-Thick Hair Thickening Conditioner by Jason 8 Fluid Ounces,0/0,2.0,"This conditioner has definitely made my hair softer, but it doesn't appeared to have thickened it. I'm using it in addition to the Jason shampoo which doesn't appear to be working either. (See review on that product's page). Save your money and look for a different cruelty-free conditioner."
5042,Pure Essence Ionic Fizz Magnesium Plus,0/0,5.0,"Not only does magnesium help you absorb calcium, it has the added bonus of keeping you regular. My 2 year old loves to drink this- 1/2 scoop. Never have a problem with constipation!"
5043,Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage,0/0,5.0,"I wasn't there when this present was opened, but the video I saw of this 1 year old interacting with it in happy abandon convinced me that it was the perfect gift. The mirror, the lights, the sounds, the songs, the buttons, were enchanting to this youngster, and I have enjoyed watching his happy enthusiasm."
5044,Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper,0/0,5.0,I bought these for my folks for Christmas last year. They love them. Nice and sharp. Now I need to buy a pair for me!
5045,"18"" Formula 1 Hydroplane Racing RC Boat",0/0,1.0,Bought 3 of these boats and two already quit after one use. They leak water probably causing them to short out. DO NOT BUY!!
5046,Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,1/1,5.0,"I just purchased this pump because I can't find some of the parts to my Medela Swing, and since I only pump to relieve engorgement, and this time very painful mastitis, I figured a manual pump was worth a try. With the last four babies, I have had, at various points, a Medela Pump in Style, a Medela Swing, and a First Years miPump, and the Medelas both worked well. But I never pumped to bottle feed, so I am not a regular pumper.All that being said, I was hesitant about the usefulness of a manual pump, but thought I'd give it a try, and I have to say I am impressed. I actually think this pump is way MORE effective than the electric pumps. With this manual pump, you can really control the rhythm, so you can match how much you pump to how much milk is actually coming out. I get way more milk way faster out of this manual pump than I ever did with my electrics. Very easy to use and not a lot of parts for cleaning and losing.Definitely would recommend this pump, especially for moms like me who don't pump all the time but just need it here and there."
5047,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,4.0,I bought this as a toy to play with my lady friend.It had a particular smell to it when I first opened the box; something caustic and unpleasant--maybe the smell of freshly molded plastic. It dissipated after washing it and airing it out.It can vibrate pretty intensely and the shape was to her liking.
5048,Tamiya 1/350 US Battleship BB-62 New Jersey,0/0,5.0,We ordered this for a Christmas gift. The person was really excited about receiving this model. He had been looking for it every where.
5049,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,5.0,Got this for our bathroom - easy to install and having both mirrors is great. We get a lot of use out of it and would recommend.
5050,Melissa & Doug See & Spell,0/0,4.0,"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter and she was very excited to play with it. Finally opened it today and I was very excited about it but I think it could have been better. Why aren't the letters magnetic? And while they do that, they could make the boards be able to hold magnets. I think that would make this toy perfect! Overall seems good though. I have a 1 year old so my daughter won't be able to play with this unless he's asleep so we won't be putting the quality to the test. But really, why isn't it magnetic?????"
5051,Enigma Perfume by Alexandra de Markoff for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,4.0,"I received this for Christmas. It has a nice spicy scent. It is not overpowering. Best used as the package suggests...""as a veil"", meaning to mist it on your body rather than saturating one spot. If you like a lightly floral scent hinting more toward spicy, I would recommend trying this fragrance."
5052,"Medela PersonalFit Small 21 mm Breastshields, 2-pk",0/0,4.0,Came brand New and had very Fast shipment!!! Great buy to go with my Medela Pump for the next baby!
5053,Melissa & Doug Plush Shark,0/0,5.0,"I bought this years ago, when my son was 6. Now that he is 9, it is still on his bed, but now it is no longer bigger than him, and it is missing an eye! Great stuffed toy."

5058,Learning Resources Supermarket Checkout,0/0,4.0,"My MIL got this for my 2 &1/2 yr old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The pretend food items are a good size and lets her pretend just like at the real store. We take turns being the clerk/customer. She pretends to pay/give change, weigh veggies, and to say thank you. Only drawback I can thinkk of is that it doesn't have sounds. A beep or cha-ching would really enhance it but overall, a toy that can occupy her for a good while."
5059,Black Opal Pre-Fade Complexion Bar,0/0,5.0,"this actually works , it truly remove things like sunburn, black spots and so on but i recommend it for anyone having problems with their face."
5060,Beautiful By Estee Lauder For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,3.0,"I purchased this for Christmas and received Beautiful Love by Estee Lauder instead of the original Beautiful. The sents were different and there was no mention of the word ""Love"" in the offer. I thought I was purchasing the original perfume and felt like I was baited and switched. I expect honestly in advertising from Amazon and did not receive it with this product."
5061,"King Oscar Mediterranean Sardines, 3.75 Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)",1/1,5.0,"These small sardines are quite tasty, with the flaver enhanced by the added olives, peppers and spices. I highly recommend these sardines to anyone who enjoys good seafood!"
5062,TOMY Gearation Building Toy,0/0,5.0,"My grandaughter keeps very busy with this unique toy. She's 14months and I know this is not in her age group, but, with supervision it gives together time and keeps her little mind going."
5063,Cachet Perfume by Prince Matchabelli for women Personal Fragrances,1/1,5.0,"I bought this for a friend for Christmas last year and she really enjoyed the fragrance, so I would recommend it."
5064,JW Pet Company GripSoft Bristle Brush Dog Brush,0/1,5.0,My dog has eczema and the dry skin is awful. I use this brush while she is wet with shampoo and she looks so much better. I love buying at Amazon. I've never had to return anything
5065,"Gund Sesame Street Elmo 13"" Plush",0/0,5.0,"We were looking for a good sized Elmo for our daughter for a while. We wanted one she could sleep with that did not make noise, did not rock back and forth or dance. Just a simple no thrills Elmo. We finally found one on here and got it for our daughter for Christmas. She takes it everywhere and it was exactly what she was looking for. The Elmo is a decent size and she likes to sit with Elmo when she watches Sesame Street or snuggle when she wants to sleep. Couldn't be more please with our purchase."
5066,Prince Of Peace Tea Premium,0/0,5.0,I bought this tea because I read that it will help lose weight. It has a very nice taste that is slightly earthy. It arrived quickly and in pristine condition. I appreciate the effort of the seller to get it to me so fast!
5067,"Iwata Needle, 0.35mm",0/0,5.0,"I guess you can't review this , it is simply a must if you want to continue using your airbrush. I'm practicing the old mantra. Is better to have it and not need it than need it and don't have it."
5068,Galt Pinball Racer,0/0,4.0,"My son received this toy for Christmas and loves it.It comes with enough parts that you can build this in a lot of different ways.The instuctions are vague,so we used the picture on the box to set it up the first time.After that we were able to come up with our own ideas.My son loves the fact that you can race four marbles at once.The marbles that came with it go down the track with ease,and so do the marbles I bought at the store."
5069,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,5.0,"My granddaughter is putting the puzzles together. She's 20 months old and is learning names of pieces, alphabet, numbers and colors!"
5070,I Play Super Skipper,0/0,1.0,I paid over $27 for this piece of JUNK! My kids opened this joint gift on Christmas and when we put brand new batteries in we found out it was a complete piece of junk. I should have listened to all the other reviews! BUYER BEWARE and learn from my mistake.

5072,Body Toolz Deluxe Manicure/Pedicure Kit,0/0,5.0,"Very convenience for the home and also for travelling, a complete set to keep your needs in this aspect of taking care of your nails"
5073,Everlasting Treat Ball,1/1,5.0,"I love this treat ball, however, do not bother putting the treat disks in the outer slots as shown in the picture. Your smart dog will chomp them right out and eat them promptly. If you put the treat disk, or any type of treat, really, in the MIDDLE compartment... this will keep your dog entertained for HOURS AND HOURS. My German Shepherd chewed at this for many hours, licking and chewing until he finally gave up exhausted and sleeping with the ball still in his paws. The Bernese Mtn Dog got hold of a Medium size ball (he should have a large) and managed to rip it apart to get to the inner area filled with treats. One expensive dog ball, destroyed. However, this was not the right size for him, so perhaps that's why. The Coton de Tulears that I gave the small size ball to have still not finished the treat. They've been licking and chewing for 2 days now. So overall, I love this product, as long as you DON'T use it the way it's shown! :)"
5074,Webkinz Black and White Cat,1/1,2.0,This was for my granddaughter and I wasn't going to give it to her once I saw it. My daughter said that was Webkinz style - I went ahead and gave it as a gift - but I'll never purchase one again.
5075,Schleich Soldier with Sledge 70002,0/0,5.0,My son started getting a couple of these as a reward when very young and fell in love with them. He now has hundred and so glad he is. They don't get out dated and are great quality.

5077,EggCrate Foam Mattress Pad - Thickness 3 inches,0/0,4.0,"Purchased this to replace the mattress in an XL dog bed. Altho' it did not measure 3&#34;, it was thcik enought to support my XL GSD. Alot less expensive than buying another bolster bed."
5078,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,5.0,"My daughter is almost 7 months now. She played it, when she was around 5 month. She really like it and can not stop to jump every time."
5079,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I love this polish! It is a tiffany blue. It dries pretty fast too for regular nail polish. I would recommend it.
5080,Lolita Lempicka Perfume For Women by Lolita Lempicka,0/0,5.0,"I have been wearing this since it was introduced, like 15 years! Absolutely intoxicating, lasts forever, and a little goes a long way. A bottle lasts me a year at least, always.Lolita Lempicka is is not 'too' anything---not too sweet, too musky, too subtle, or too flowery. There are no harsh notes that 'hurt' your nose. It's totally feminine, but not too childish nor too sexy. It's perfect.One sniff so long ago, and I was hooked. Haven't found anything since that's better!"
5081,Bachmann Industries Inc. Passenger Car 85? Full Dome Passenger Car - Amtrak - N Scale,1/1,5.0,this is a great product from Bachmann. really smooth running metal wheels in this series. the dome lights up well as promised
5082,"Spicy World Citric Acid, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,"I almost didn't order this due to the bad reviews on this product. But I am so glad I tried it!! The packaging was wonderful!! I ordered 5 lbs and it came in 2 bags of 2 1/2 lbs each. They were nicely packaged in very heavy foily bags, the reason being for freshness. I appreciated them thinking of that. I make fizzy bath bombs with this and you need your product fresh you get good fizz. Am so glad I found a good company to order this from when I need it!!"
5083,MyoTape Body Tape Measure,1/1,5.0,"This is the best tape measure if you are a seamstress. I love that I can now take accurate measurements of myself in privacy. Unfortunately, it also tells me that I need to pay attention to the measures that seem to be getting a bit larger every year, booo."
5084,Garnier Nutrisse Nourishing Color Creme with Fruit Oil Concentrate Hair Coloring Products,0/0,5.0,I was a lifelong Clairol user until I tried Garnier. The only reason I picked it up was it was on sale so I thought why not. While this hair color does not deliver something extaordinary the product experience is so much better. I was a little irritated that there is an extra step where you have to put in the fruit oil along with the color in the developer bottle but in the end who cares. The product is so much thicker and does not have as strong a color-at-home scent. The conditioner is also thicker and does not slide out of your hand in the shower. The color when applied looks like a thicker version of pancake batter. When I was done I realized i didn't mind coloring my hair so much. And it seems this brand is cheaper than others in store and online so I don't need to find coupons which is getting harder to do. Remember when one was included in every box? A+ rating. Will definitely buy again.
5085,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,I love this polish! It is a tiffany blue. It dries pretty fast too for regular nail polish. I would recommend it.
5086,Webz 108 Magnetic Construction Kit W108,0/0,5.0,This was a smaller box that what I was expecting. However there is HUGE fun inside. Nice bright colors. My 6 year old loves it. I will order more pieces from this vendor. My 3 year old also likes sticking them to the cookie sheet. (Just need to watch so he does not eat them)
5087,Neutrogena Micro-Mist Tanning Sunless Spray,0/0,1.0,"I was not impressed. After using a variety of drugstore spray tanners, this one is by far the worst I've used. First, it smells awful, like hairspray. Second, it streaks. Third, the ""deep"" color barely showed up on my fairly pale skin (which actually worked out to my advantage, since then you could not really see the streaking, since the ""deep"" color was just barely darker than my skin). It's not worth the $11. I'm sticking with Hawaiian Topics Sunless Tanning lotion. More bang for your buck."
5088,Jumanji The Game,0/0,5.0,"The game is great, and our son was so excited and he is having a great time playing. Although I so feel it was a bit overpriced I am happy with the purchase."
5089,Terranova Patchouli Perfume Essence 0.375 fl oz Bottle,0/0,1.0,The smell is too strong. I won't were that as a perfum. Maybe a drop in a pot pourri pot for a room fragrance would be acceptable but even then that would be too expensive.
5090,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,This is just like the $60 plus on inthose other pet stores. It works great and takes all that extra hair away!
5091,Safari,0/0,5.0,The look of this tiny bird is great. He's eating a piece of fruit (not fruit-loops). His colors are very sharp and bright. He is a wonderful addition to my collection.
5092,In A Pickle,0/0,3.0,We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our child. I was unfamiliar with it but read the box description and looked at the examples on the back of the box. It seemed like a lot of fun and very straightforward. Build rows of cards with items from smallest to biggest. The examples on the box were very easy to follow
5093,Buster Food Cube Interactive Dog Toy (Colors Vary),0/0,4.0,I love the idea of this toy! I have a chow/golden retriever and a tripawd golden retriever. They are both having a hard time figuring it out. I'm hopeful that they will get the hang of it over a bit more time!
5094,"Van Ness CP7 Enclosed Cat Pan/Litter Box, Extra Large, colors are assorted",0/0,5.0,"My overweight Norwegian Forest Cat is big (NFC owners know how big these cats are!) When digging around in a box, he has a tendency to scoop the litter outside of his box. In smaller, lower-walled boxes, when trying to back himself up to the hole he's just dug, he sometimes misses and goes over the side. This box is roomy enough and the walls are high enough that neither of these are an issue with this box.Note for owners of smaller cats"
5095,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,0/0,1.0,"My first Waterpik wad purchased in 2010 and it was great! But a year after I bought it, I accidently left it at a hotel. So I bought another one. Within 3 months it stopped holding a charge. I was very frustrated with the lack of quality and tossed it away. After reading the poor reviews, which out number the good on Amazon, I went with a different brand. But it too stopped working quickly. Less than 30 days to be more specific. So I'm back to square one, 2yrs and 3 picks later. I did read a couple of reviews on the Waterpik that say the poor cord design can be fixed with something from Radio Shack. And given the low price, it is tempting to purchase this. But right now I can not convince myself that's the best reason. Maybe Waterpick will fix their problem and I can return as a customer."
5096,"DURACELL D12 PROCELL Professional Alkaline Battery, 12 Count",0/0,5.0,"They are great for use around the house, shop, garage, shows, business for all flashlights and other devices. low cost"
5097,"Bona Stone Tile and Laminate Floor Cleaner Refill, 128-Ounce",0/0,5.0,This is my second order and I have laminate floors and Bona shines them up so beautifully and I don't have to do a lot of hard scrubbing for the shine to pop through. It also drys very fast so no worries on it leaving your floors wet too long.
5098,Bruder Toys Man Side Loading Garbage Truck Orange,0/0,4.0,I bought this truck for my 7 year old and he loves it. It is good size and quite sturdy.
5099,Malem Ultimate Selectable Bedwetting Alarm with Vibration - Royal Blue,3/4,5.0,this machine everyting said i can do the standerd alarm is horrofying and was glas to have other options to go with the telephone ring was the favorite. Our son who had wet pull ups every night even afer reducing watering and then trying to wake him up het a routine in still wet his bed after using this machine for 2 weeks slowly peed less and less. It took 2 weeks i was so amazing it been 2 months not since we stoped using the machine and no accdidnets and no need to wake him up his confidence went up as well and now want to go on sleep overs. :)
5100,Viviscal Extra Strenth Dietary Supplement,0/0,4.0,"I have been suffering with hair loss due to my autoimmune disease and its treatments. My dermatologist suggested that I try this twice a day for three months, then daily for another three months. I think it has worked to some degree. I am still losing hair but it seems that the rate of loss has slowed down. One thing that seems to be happening is that it is growing longer at a quicker pace. I will see my dermatologist in a couple months to see what she has to say but unless she says I should cease taking it, I will add it as a long term compliment to my daily pills and supplements."
5101,DCS Remote Control System,0/0,5.0,"The DCS system works extremely well. It works exactly as advertised. It has &#34;crashed&#34; a couple of times, when my kids get ahold of it and push too many buttons at once. Can't really blame the DCS for that. Just shut down the track, and start it up again and everything works fine. Overall, I'm very impressed with this method of controlling trains."
5102,"Tetra 77137 Water Clarifier, 16.90-Ounce, 500-ml",0/0,2.0,"I used this product on Sunday afternoon and the water was crystal clear by Tuesday night. I thought this product wasn't going to work, but the water cleared up just in time before I was going to give a double dose. If you want fast results this product isn't for you. I also noticed my fish started to act a little crazy as soon as I dropped the solution in the water."
5103,"Mehaz Cuticle Nipper ""Comfort Grip"" 1/4 Jaw #700",0/0,1.0,"I had the same issues as Bentley. I had a pair of Mehaz just like these and I loved them. But, they were old and getting dull. These are horrible, and have to be manually spread apart in order to use them. They are expensive and frustrating to use. A total waste of money."
5104,Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Love to Play Puppy,0/0,4.0,My 3 month old grandson really likes this bear its very cute! The price was better then what I found in stores.
5105,Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Light Up Aquarium Cars,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this as an &#34;extra&#34; for my 2 1/2 year old son for christmas. It works great on the Thomas Wooden railway set. He loves that it has the little animals floating inside & especially enjoys the &#34;light up feature&#34;. So far so good on durability, but it's only been 2 days :) Magnetic linkage works fine.Pros:+ mates with Thomas Wooden Railway sets+ floating creatures & LEDs are sure to entertain any child+ Shipped as expectedWe are very satisfiedCons:None"
5106,Doctors Best High Absorption Magnesium,1/1,5.0,"I read a scientific study (that was not funded by the industry) that showed that Magnesium helps when taken with some medications for fibromyalgia. I am a nutraceutical skeptic, but this really seems to help me. It has eased my fibro symptoms to some degree."
5107,Lifegard Aquatics Micron Filter Cartridge 9.75 Inc,0/0,1.0,"I didn't use this product because it was the incorrect size for my Magnum 350 canister filter. It was my mistake, I returned it and ordered the correct size. I will say that I was quite pleased with the short turnaround time it took to receive the correct filter cartridges."
5108,JUICY PEAR Jelly Belly Beans ~ 1/2 to 10 Pounds,0/0,5.0,I love juicy pear Jelly Bellys. They taste like pears. I gave them to my daughter because she loves them.
5109,Webkinz Black And White Panda Plush,0/0,5.0,"My son REALLY wanted a Panda Webkinz for Christmas, and when he found this one in his stocking - he was SO excited!!! He LOVES it!!!!!!!!"
5110,CytoSport Cytomax Sport Energy Drink,0/0,5.0,"I've been using Cytomax daily for more than a decade. A few years ago they changed their formula to make it less sweet. At first I didn't care for it so I wrote the company and a couple of months later I received a very nice reply letter and a complimentary 1.5 lb tub. Now, I much prefer the less sweet flavor and it seems other companies are moving in that direction. I still use just less than 1 scoop for 32 oz. but that is perfect for me. I start EVERYDAY with a liter of Cytomax and sometimes have a 2nd liter at the end of the day just to keep hydrated. I love Cytomax!"
5111,L de Lolita Lempicka EDP Spray Women,0/0,3.0,"This starts off with a charming dark, musky aroma -- like ginger in the woods. Rapidly it settles in to sticky, sweet cinnamon bun. It's not terrible, but I don't like to smell like candy. The scent is very strong & has staying power. I think I'll wear this when I forget that I don't like to smell like candy & use it to scent rooms for holiday gatherings."
5112,Webkinz Pink Pony,0/0,5.0,"My son REALLY wanted a Princess Pony Webkinz for Christmas, and when she found this one in her stocking - she was SO excited!!! She LOVES it!!!!!!!!"

5114,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy,0/0,4.0,Not much to say about this...I bought it for our 13month old for Christmas. I think almost every kid has one of these.
5115,Siphotrol Plus Fogger 6oz,0/0,5.0,"Been using Siphotrol foggers for 15 years for fleas, ants, spiders, palmetto bugs and wasps. It does a great job and keeps the house bug free for 7 or 8 months as it says. We bomb the house twice a year to keep all the bugs away. It also kills the flying termites. Highly recommended by my veterinarian and I agree. Great product. Product arrived in a timely manner too."
5116,Schylling Jack-In-The-Box,0/0,4.0,"Looks, acts, and plays like the old jack in the boxes. Was a real hit with the kids at Christmas."
5117,Dimensions Learn To Paint! Paint By Number Kit (9 X 12 Inches),0/1,5.0,This new way you have of reviewing purchases stinks in my opinion. I like the old way better. It had all the info this one has and was clearer and for people that are not verbose it was a perfect set up. So until this changes I will not be writing any more reviews.
5118,"Handi-Drink Dog Water Bottle- 17 Oz - The Portable, Spill-proof Way to Keep Pets Hydrated, Color may vary",0/0,4.0,Gave this as a gift and she loves it. Says it works perfectly and does not leak. Will be buying one for myself.

5120,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,5.0,"The whole family is thrilled by the Lionel Polar Express Train set! The diecast locomotive engine is a future-heirloom. I was hesitant with the plastic rail, but it is all made of superb quality. Hours upon hours of fun- and I feel like it's Christmas 1976 again with the real smoke puffs and the head lights. We also love how the passenger cars light up with beautiful silhouettes from the movie- the abandoned toy car, the children's passenger car, and little Billy's caboose. Set up was a cinch, too. I'm hopeful that this train will be a part of our Christmas tradition for many, many years to come. And it warms my heart that this set will be passed on to my son's children in the future."
5121,Anti-tip Furniture Strap,0/0,5.0,"These are so simple to install and very secure. It is a must in any home with small children and if you don't think you need them, watch the CPSC videos that I did and think, what if that was my kid."
5122,Sevi Xylophone Toy,0/0,1.0,"Please don't waste your money buying this Xylophone, it's very pretty to look at but that's all. It sounds like a drum instead of a xylophone. the tone is horrible. It's made in CHINA not ITALY so concerned about lead too. Such a waste, I'm returning this."

5126,Davidoff Cool Water for Women Eau de Toilette,0/0,5.0,This is a lovely light fragrance that is wonderful for summertime but can easily be worn through all seasons of the year.
5127,Wee-Wee Housebreaking Pads for Dogs,0/0,4.0,"Great!takes care of the problem, just wish it was a bit larger. I looked for larger pads but price wise this was the beat option. We like it well enough to order it again."
5128,Roux Fanci Full Mousse #56 Bashful Blonde 6 oz,0/0,4.0,"This product gives your hair a nice color tone. It's not a huge difference, but enough to make the purchase worthwhile. Also, it's works well as a styling mousse."
5129,Casdon Electronic Microwave,0/0,4.0,"Love it! looks great and make &#34;real&#34; sounds.It looks sturdy enough but is too soon to know if it will be abel to stand two little ones!The play food, could really use an upgrade, neither I nor the kids care for it."
5130,Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,0/0,2.0,"I don't like it at all. First it seems to always get caught in the grass and its like I'm having a tug of war with the grass over the poop, the worst part is when I pull to hard and rip up grass and it flings at me. Secondly one of the wires bent on it nothing worse than having to re bend the wire on the pooper scooper. Will be looking for a new pooper scooper."
5131,Matchbox Car Wash Adventure Set,0/0,2.0,Small and not well made. For the amount of cars we buy these companies should make some well made toys to go with them already.returning.
5132,Pokemon By Air Val International For Men and Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,0/0,3.0,"scent is a little strong, but bottle is cute. She probably wont use the scent in bottle, just bottle itself"
5133,Lola 903 Rola Sticky Mop Refill,0/0,5.0,"I love my Lola Rola sticky mop. It's long handled (so no bending to the floor to try to roll the carpet) and the mop-sheets peel apart pretty well. Saves me so much cleaning and I roll the floors before I vacuum, mop or sweep. It really reduces the amount of pet hair that I have to clean out of the vacuum cleaner. They are hard to find in the stores, so I have resorted to ordering on-line. I'd recommend this to anyone who has pets to keep the pet hair under control. They are not cheap but I feel well worth the cost."
5134,Schleich Quintain,0/0,5.0,"Wonderful detail, excellent quality. Purchased for an 8yo boy. We are very pleased with this item. Will definitely be buying more Schleich in the future.Son was adamant about this one. He loves it. Sturdy, and well made."
5135,Nature's Way Goldenseal Root,0/0,4.0,"Great for colds and infections. It does work. I have tried a stronger brand in the past. I need to use 3 of these when I am really sick, compared to 2 of the other, but the price difference makes it worth it."
5136,Natural Silk Sea Sponges,0/0,1.0,"Put this product in my cart at under $4 per sponge, price was changed after. My fault for not noticing it had changed, but there were a bunch of other items in my cart & I didn't spot it until too late. The sponges I received were tiny. I contacted them for authorization to return, which they gave. Delivery confirmation says they received them back Dec 10th, and here on the 26th they still have not credited my account for the return. If you need a tiny little craft sponge, you might be able to use these things, but if you want a sponge you can use to shower with, go to Target. UPDATE"
5137,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,4.0,A great help to cut the cost of grooming. Dog sat and didn't seem bothered. Will use as needed in future.
5138,Chrome By Azzaro For Men,0/0,5.0,My son's favorite fragrance and I happen to think it's a great one too. It was a gift and he was happy to receive it. Service was quick and product was received as I expected - new and in perfect condition.
5139,Petego Pet Tube Kennel,0/0,5.0,Very good product. Had 2 cats in it that had never traveled before. I had no problems on this trip.
5140,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magic Set,0/0,5.0,"I got this kit for my 7 year-old daughter. It's well made and has great tricks. It's really fun watching her do magic and she's having a super great time.A couple of years ago, for her older brother, we bought a very popular kit - different than this one. It wasn't nearly as fun or well made."
5141,Invacare IB Thumb Spica Large - X-Large,0/0,5.0,"I cut it off all the way around the wrist end to make it shorter. The metal splint inside is a little longer than the device now, but I only use it to blow dry my hair. My bad hand holds the hair brush while I style my hair, so I need the support. I spent $60 on a leather splint from my dr's office and it's much more comfortable than this. This is neoprene, so it's not that bad, but still not as good as the leather. I also had trouble wearing this in hot weather and using Ketoprofen pain creme. I got a horrible, raised, itchy rash. I finally saw a dermatologist the second week when the rash wouldn't go away. He said neoprene is one of the top 50 allergens in the U.S., so I guess it contributed to the rash. As an experiment, I wore it in hot weather again and took it off when I noticed signs of a rash again. I can wear a wetsuit in hot weather without a problem, but then I spend most of the time in cold water in that situation."
5142,Uncle Milton Moon In My Room,0/0,5.0,It's not too bright & can be used as a nightlight that will turn off automatically. It shipped fast also.
5143,Model T Kit Rock Tumbler,0/0,5.0,"Very easy to use .once we got going ,which was pretty easy .we were looking to polish any and every rock we could find.we ,as in my 5year old grandson.very satisfied"
5144,"Squire, Courtiers, Schleich",0/0,5.0,My son started getting a couple of these as a reward when very young and fell in love with them. He now has hundred and so glad he is. They don't get out dated and are great quality.
5145,Melissa & Doug Cutting Food,0/0,5.0,My two and half year received this as a Christmas present. He spent over an hour Christmas morning cutting the food and then putting it back together so he could cut it again. The only issue I see is that the velcro may eventually wear out and they pieces won't stick together but other than it is a great toy.
5146,Plastic Pattern Blocks (Set of 250),0/0,5.0,These are exactly as described. Brightly colored plastic that have a nice weight in between wood and plastic! Both my 3yo & my 6yo love them! Wonderful for allowing them to explore their creative side as well as build patterns that build cognitive reasoning.
5147,"PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32""",0/0,5.0,"During the last nine years, I've had six lumbar spinal surgeries, including two fusions. At this time, I have fusions at L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1. What that means is that I can't bend or twist very much, and even trying to bend or twist can cause my next free disk to fail. So I have to use a reacher to pick up things. After three of my surgeries, my health insurance company provided me with a reacher, each a different model. I keep them in the house in the areas where I'm most likely to drop things.The three reachers I have now are:* The Golden Retreiver 31 Inch Reacher* PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32""* Duro-Med 32 Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic TipEach reacher works very well, and I use at least one of them almost every day. Overall, the Golden Retriever is my favorite, as well as the most used, and I think it's the sturdiest of the three. It will pick up objects up to slightly more than three inches across. It's my favorite because the design of the handle puts the pulling force in line with my arm, with every finger curling the same amount. With weak, arthritic hands, that's a real plus compared to my other reachers, which have angled pistol grips.The PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32"" is a nice reacher, but it's my least favorite one because the angled pistol grip requires quite a bit of force to pull. However, it has the widest grip of the three, with a whopping 5 inches between the pick-up tips, and it's the only one big enough to pick up the newspaper from the driveway.The Duro-Med 32 Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic Tip is a very nice reacher, and it's the most versatile of my three reachers. The magnetic tip is great for picking up small steel items like gem clips and screws (before I got this one, I took a wooden dowel and cemented a small magnet to the tip). Also, the angled pistol grip requires only a very light touch to close the jaws. Note that one of the jaws pivots on an angle, which is an advantage for some items and a disadvantage for others.------------------------------------I use each of the three reachers at least a couple of times a week, and I'm pleased with each of them. My main caveat applies to the PikStik-Pro Aluminum Reacher, 32"". It requires quite a bit of force compared to the other two, so it may not be suitable for people with weak or arthritic hands.At the time I'm writing this review, Amazon sells each of the three reachers, with prices ranging from ten to twenty dollars. They're all 5-star devices in my opinion, but each excels in certain functions as well as having certain drawbacks."
5148,Animal Naturals K9 Show Stopper - 7 lb,0/0,5.0,Probably my favorite supplement. My pit/lab mix loves it and it makes his coat beautiful and helps with weight management
5149,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,Just a great learning toy even the older people will enjoy this and being able to help at the same time will check into more Items like this
5150,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver,0/0,5.0,"Best toy purchase ever!! ...Okay, maybe not EVER, but it's pretty freakin' cool. Besides coming early, I paid close attention to where everything was. It took some digging in an old junk drawer to find a screwdriver tiny enough (good thing I've saved it for the 11th Doctor's when that comes), but after five minutes of patience and care with the batteries it paid off.I have had the best time having fun with the pen (sparingly, since I want it to last), and it actually makes a decent flashlight. This was tested during Hurricane Sandy when the power went out and my flashlight went dead. I've gotten good at flipping it and catching it like the Doctor, and sometimes I stow it in my purse for days when I'm bored.To be honest, yes, it can get tiring after a while. But I bought it over seven months ago, and the batteries still work. The lights, the sounds - they all still work! And it's the best thing a fan of David Tennant's Doctor can have. :)Now, if you excuse me, I am off to run around my room with the sonic and pretend I'm having adventures with a madman in a box."
5151,Radio Flyer My 1st Scooter Red,0/0,5.0,This is a great toy. My nephew loved it. Would recommend for your child. Also a reasonable rate. The platform is wide enough for stability.
5152,"Finish Powerball Tablets, Fresh Scent",0/0,5.0,"We used the cheaper cascade packs at our house for a long time, but we kept noticing a layer of ""grit"" on glasses and other items in the dishwasher. I noticed that I have a pack of these finish powerballs from when they were ""free"" at CVS one time. We used the finish powerballs and even with this seasons heaving cooking/baking, I started to notice that the ""grit"" was gone. I never put much thought into it and just thought it was a cheap dishwasher causing the grit, but it seems to be cured now.At the very least I think this saved me from getting a new dishwasher. The powerballs are a bit more expensive than other brands, but if you watch here on amazon or other places you can pick them up at pretty good prices."
5153,Jason Natural Products Shampoo Apricot Keratin,0/0,4.0,This product has helped with my current psoriasis flare and the unbearable itching that goes along with psoriasis. Try it!
5154,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,5.0,These wipes are awesome and are made just the right size for my boys. The only downside (if at all) is that there is so many in the shipment that I scatter them in different rooms throughout the house. And then I don't realize we're runnin low until they are all used up...lol.
5155,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy,0/0,5.0,"My 9 month old can't even walk yet to push this thing, but he already loves playing with it. I remember this toy from when I was a kid...same toy, same quality. I'm sure we'll enjoy this for quite some time."
5156,Jarrow L-Taurine 1000mg,1/1,5.0,"Great product, I really enjoyed the quality of the ingredients! It was more than I expected for such a great deal!"
5157,Kid's Acoustic Toy Guitar (25-Inch) with Carrying Bag and Accessories,0/0,2.0,"The guitar was broken when we opened the box Christmas morning. I don't know what it is called, but the the thing that holds the strings opposite from where you tune it was broken. My son was really disappointed, hopefully they will take it back. It looked like an okay guitar and the case, strap, picks, etc. were a nice addition. I'm guessing this was just a defective one or possibly jostled too much during holiday shipping."
5158,"Estroven Maximum Strength, 60 caplets - 2 Caplets/Serving",2/2,4.0,I like it. No hot flash after taking it. Makes you feel young and stronger. The only thing I don't like is caplets are too big and needs to drink a lot of water to swallow them which makes my stomach feel very full.
5159,Black by Kenneth Cole New York Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"The smells seems a little strong for work and more like for a club, but I don,t go to any clubs so I wear it to my office where my secretaries tells me the cologne smells good."
5160,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,3.0,"I liked that this toy came with 3 squeaking squirrels and a tree trunk for them to go in. My dog enjoys shredding toys so I thought this might be a good toy to try to refocus his energy.He likes the squirrels and will pull one out and play with it. So far, it's still all in one piece which is good for him. My only issue and why this received 3 stars is because the hole on the top of the trunk is too large. If I get my dog to focus on the sides, it will take him a little big of time to remove one. But if he goes through the top, there is no struggle for him.The toy still makes a great deal having the 3 squirrels and the trunk. The trunk could be used to hold other items for the dog to remove. I was considering trying to find something that would be difficult to get out of the top hole but we shall see."
5161,"Max Factor MAXeye Shadows, 0.12-Ounce Packages",1/1,5.0,"This products works amazingly well, but you have to keep up with it everyday (at least I do) in order keeps the bumps under control. Doesn't take care of every last ingrown hair, but works well, better than any other product I've tried. I will continue using this as long as they carry it. On a side note, I much prefer the roll on bottle, it lasts ten times longer, because cotton balls will soak up most of the solution. It's also easier to rub on. I just buy the regular bottles and refill the roll on when needed."
5162,Oscar By Oscar De La Renta For Women. Dusting Powder 5.3 Oz.,0/0,5.0,I love the Oscar De La Renta dusting powder and have for a long time. It has a beautiful scent :)
5163,RaZbaby Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier,0/0,2.0,"I never even got to try this product out. I sanitized it, as the packaging said I could. Prior to sanitizing it, it closed with a snap. Afterwards it slowly closed, but never completely. Even after pressing the sides together, it would not stay closed around the nipple.If you get this product, do not boil or steam it. Just wash it in hot water with a mild soap."
5164,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,5.0,It meets my expectations and I would recoment it to others. I choose it because I trust the brand. It works well for my coworkers.
5165,Melissa & Doug Learn-To-Play Piano,0/0,5.0,"Purchased this for Christmas for a toddler and a preschooler. Both kids enjoy playing with it and even I like to tap out some of the songs from the book. It's a nice heavy structure with a glossy paint finish. I know some reviews said the top came off, but ours appears to be very firmly attached. The strip of paper that labels the keys really is just a strip of paper with a dab of glue/tape on either end. My kids took this off almost immediately, but it's easy to put back on and if you want a more secure attachment, glue the entire strip down. I actually kind of like that it can be removed giving you the option of not labeling the keys.The sound is not an amazing concert piano, obviously, but sounds like you'd expect and is not unpleasant. Overall I'm really happy with the purchase, but I also bought this during a 50% off sale so I think I picked it up for about $35. I think that was a steal for this."
5166,"Aurora Plush 12"" Murphy Flopsie",0/0,5.0,"My granddaughter loves it, she is 3 months old and just loves cuddling with this dog. She stops crying as soon as we put it on her tummy! And a plus, it looks just like her Lhasa Also puppy!"
5167,"Garden of Life Super Seed Beyond Fiber, 600-Grams",1/1,5.0,This product is such a boon for the body. I gave it to my mother in law who is diabetic and after she took this for 2 weeks her sugar levels stabilized after a lot of wild swings. Highly recommended to keep you regular and healthy.
5168,Boudreaux's Butt Paste 16 oz. Jar,0/0,5.0,Nothing cleared up diaper rashes better on both my kids than Butt paste. It goes on thick and stays put. It's unique odor and color can take getting used to though.
5169,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Shark,0/0,5.0,By far my son's FAVORITE gift he got for Christmas. &#34;Santa&#34; brought this for him!! So worth the money even if it is a little small. But he's only 4 and it works perfectly for him. The controller is way easy for him to use and hold and the car is easy to use for him as well. He's hoping for it to snow or rain or something so he can use it outside!!
5170,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,4.0,"This Jumperoo is great. Feels very sturdy & safe. I appreciated the adjustable heights to accommodate a quickly growing baby. The toys are entertaining.Moving the Jumperoo from room to room is a bit tricky - it's an awkward size and is hard to fit through standard inside doors. But my baby doesn't care about those things - he's happy that he can be upright, entertained, and active.And as a bonus, it matches all of our other Fisher-Price Rainforest items."
5171,Natrol (incl Laci Le Beau Teas) Pure Citrimax,1/1,4.0,"The company was quite satisfactory..on time and no extra chargesto me for the international shipment.I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because one cap. 3 times a daydid not work for me but as soon as I increased to 2 caps. 3 times a day,I see decrease in my appetite as well as increase in my energy level.Thank you Amazon!"
5172,Maxim Enterprise Inc Big Train Tunnel Set,0/0,1.0,way too small. none of our trains will fit through the tunnel and what good is a tunnel that no trainbs will fit through?? very disappointed
5173,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/2,1.0,"Do NOT buy this product from Amazon. I ordered one box, opened in to find that the &#34;oil&#34; was hard as a rock. Had another replacement send and this &#34;oil&#34; was also hard as a rock and it was turning white. Amazon does not check these items whatsoever. They sit in the warehouse for years and they don't open the boxes before shipping to make sure the product is good. Very disappointing."
5174,Make Up For Ever Face & Body Liquid Makeup,0/0,5.0,I have tried so many foundations and love this product. It was recommended by Sephora. I do not like a thick foundation nor that pasty look. This goes on smoothly especially over a primer. I use the primer by the same company and my face glows. Check out the different color primers for different facial problems. You can build with this foundation for more coverage.
5175,African Shea Oil - 8 ozs.,0/0,5.0,This oil is great for all over the body. Hair and skin can benefit from use. I have only one complaint with this bottle. It is not enough. 8 oz is way too small for a product such as this one. You can go through it very quickly because it is very light...It is a great product and i plan on purchasing again.
5176,27 Pc Cookware Playset - Primary,0/0,5.0,Daughter loves the dishware. It appears to be sturdy and well made.It survives my 2 year old anyway. o
5177,Small World Toys Active Edge (Lucky Lanes Bowling Set),0/0,1.0,Very disappointed in this bowling set. Some of the pins were dirty and one was torn. I would've returned it but I didn't notice it until my son had unwrapped it for Christmas.
5178,Jessica McClintock Eau de Parfum,0/0,5.0,"My wife wanted this for christmas. What makes my wife happy, makes me happy! So I bought it for her. I'm happy."
5179,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,Bought the large 3 oz bottle for my Sweetie for Christmas 2012 and she loves it.. and for only $19 and free shipping.. hey... I'll do it again.Walmart couldn't even come close to that price....
5180,American Baby Company Quilted Waterproof Cradle Mattress Pad,0/0,4.0,For my new nephew to go in the new cradle to be covered by the new sheets have I used enough words yet?
5181,Juli Ashton's Anal Trainer Set,0/0,5.0,The large plug takes some getting used to. It is a little touchy at first until it goes in then it's very good. Stays in place well and is comfortable. The vibrator has many uses and is an excellent addition.
5182,T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer,0/0,3.0,This is a very noisy dryer....and the switch is in the wrong place and easy to turn off by accident when drying your hair...I would not purchase this brand again.
5183,Mehmet Efendi Turkish Coffee,1/1,5.0,"Very authentic product, tastes nearly like in Turkey (the water makes a difference). Very finely ground, almost like powder, easy to measure or spoon into water and boil."
5184,Formula VM-75 Tablets (High Potency Multiple Vitamins and Minerals) By Solgar - 360 Count,0/0,5.0,"Solgar generally has fine products,I have used them in the past.I feel that it helps for general health.Again, a fine product."
5185,RaZbaby Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier,0/0,5.0,Great price!!! It looks just like the picture! It's perfect for a little girl. I can't wait to use this.
5186,Forum Novelties HK-C001 Electric Shocking Gag Pen,1/1,3.0,"After a while, of course the battery would wear off, but it does not still make it less of a working pen, for those new to products like this, the pen can extend by twisting the tip on the opposite end of the cap(the cap being the part that when pressed down like a normal pen, emits a shock)."
5187,Sesame Street Small Plush,0/0,5.0,wanted something soft & safe for my 2yr niece. well made & a perfect size her a young child. She loves it
5188,CHAMPION Neoprene Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Hinged Bars,0/0,3.0,"The stabilizer kept slipping down my leg. I wouldn't recommend this item, and have found that a cane is my best relief for removing stress on the knee."
5189,Lamaze Play & Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,0/0,5.0,"Baby is just under 2 months and pretty much sleeps all the time, but when she wakes up this keeps her attention. Recommend it highly."
5190,"Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, Black",0/0,5.0,Been through a few different devices and systems. This by far - does the best. The vacuum has a major impact on it's performance.
5191,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"This whey protein is the best I've tried. It tastes good, actually works, and it's cheap. I've only tried delicious strawberry but I've heard great things about all the other flavors. I've also tried GNC's Wheybolic Extreme 60. I hated the flavors so I can't say if they really work or not. The Gold Standard is my new go to protein. You can pick up 2 pounds for around $27 or 3 pounds of Wheybolic for $70 at a GNC. The Gold Standard is just as good if not better and it's much, much cheaper. I recommend this protein 100%. Don't just take my word for it, there are hundreds of other happy customers out there. Don't even think twice about buying this one. It's awesome."
5192,"Breathe Right Nasal Strips, Large, 30-Count Boxes",1/1,1.0,I do not have sensitive skin but here I am at work with a big purple mark across my face. It was excruciatingly painful to remove the strip as I attempted to pull it off as slowly and gently as possible. Then someone comes up to me at work and says that the same thing happened to her husband. Be very careful! It also did nothing to help me breathe better with a congested nose.
5193,"Neuvaderm (1.7 fl Oz.) Rejuvenating Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle & Moisturizing Cream",1/1,5.0,Goes on smooth and has a nice feel. Couldn't tell that it did much for the tiny wrinkles. I'm going to keep looking.
5194,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"This protein powder seems on par with most of the better brands, having everything I need for a before, after, or during workout boost. It also happens to taste good. Not a heavy coffee flavor, but more of a light coffee/chocolate taste. Also does well with either milk or water, which is important to me as I sometimes forget the darn milk, then I get PO'd if I brought a powder that tastes bad with water. So this product helps me avoid angst!! Therefore I love it."
5195,"Snoozer Lookout I Pet Car Seat, Small, Highland Maize",0/0,5.0,"As seems to be the norm, my schichon immediately claimed the snoozer as her own as soon as it was unwrapped & set down. We keep it in front of a bay window when inside, then pop it in the car when it is time to go. She absolutely loves it, & took no time at all to adjust to the restraint between her harness & the seat belt. Construction is nice & solid, the seat is very secure in the car, & my 6 lb pup can see out fine, with plenty of room to grow into the medium sized seat. I had considered using a ""pet taxi"" type crate for car rides, but she is so miserable boxed in the whole time...not worth the trade off for idea of more safety, that is really just a layer of flimsy plastic that offers minimal protection in a crash & can still fly all over the car with my girl inside. This seat makes car rides fun, keeps her safe in the backseat, & has the added bonus of being easy to move into the house to use as THE choice seat inside. I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase & feel that the pricing is commensurate with the product & our level of satisfaction. Great buy!"
5196,Alex Toys Kids Bath Crayons Tub Toy,0/0,5.0,"Oh how excited he was when he opened his package of Bath crayons!! We have tried several different brands before and they were like trying to draw with wax! No fun, he got discouraged and I ended upi throwing them away. Then we found this kind in a store 2 years ago, He loved it, it fits in his hands, all the colors are right there, they go one smooth, if he wants to color his body no problem comes right off. Very easy to clean up afterwards.. Hours of fun in the tub! So excited to find these on Amazon!!!"
5197,North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate,0/0,5.0,"As much as I hate to say it, this is a fantastic gate. It is imported as I could not find one Made In USA. It is very well built and the self-closing feature is fantastic. Included in the box is a paper that states that the bend in the product is by design. Once installed, the gate feels very secure and is very easy to operate. I will most likely purchase another."
5198,Micro Tweeze Hair Microwave Hair Remover,0/0,5.0,This little pot of wax takes a little to melt but maybe that was due my crappy little college microwave. Pot is a little smaller than what i expected but it is facial wax.
5199,LCR - Left Center Right Dice Game - Random Color,0/0,5.0,"This isn't so much a product review as it is a game review. If you haven't played LCR before then you need to do yourself a favor, spend a few dollars on the dice and get the game. It's great fun with a group of friends or family. I usually play with dollar bills instead of chips. $3 a game, it's fun to have friends together playing, or family after holiday dinner, and try to make a little extra money. People play Bingo and poker for money so why not mix it up and play LCR? Really fun."
5200,Vidal Sassoon VS184C Three-Barrel Waver,0/0,4.0,"Works well, once you learn how to use it properly. Play around and try different ways. Arrived on time and as described."
5201,Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,0/0,1.0,"First off, one of the track pieces is quite messed up. It would not connect to any of the other pieces on one end for some reason, no matter what I tried. I finally was able to get it set up just well enough that the train could go around, but the slightest bump made the track come apart again.Second, the couplers don't work. Only the middle two sections will stay together. The caboose and the engine both come apart, making the first two cars only connected by the little cable connecting the power to the engine.Third, the train hardly stays on the track. Again, the slightest bump makes the train derail.Fourth, oh my freaking gosh the noises the train makes when it's not being used are so ANNOYING!In all fairness, my children still love it. But it's driving me crazy! I would not recommend this product. I will be looking to get a refund."
5202,"Aveeno Active Naturals Stress Relief Foaming Bath, 10-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,Everything they make is terrific.....the bath soap is great and works awesome. I love the smell and the feel on my skin

5205,"Viralys (L-Lysine) Oral Gel For Cats, 5 oz",1/1,5.0,This was so much cheaper online than when our veterinarian got it for us. My cat loves the taste and just licks it right out of the lid when I squeeze it.
5206,New Chapter Turmericforce,1/1,5.0,"My wife and I have purchased this tumericforce many times and will continue to use this for its health benefits. When you read the picture showing the 20% more free, this is misleading as you are led to believe that you are receiving a discount when in fact you are purchasing the larger size at the same per capsule price as the other sizes. Since we use this daily, it made more sense to purchase the larger size. Great product!"
5207,Clairol Jazzing Semi Permanent Hair Color,0/0,1.0,"This site sucks.. My order has not yet arrived, Im very dissapointed. I was roibbed.. I paid for a product, you got my money and still havent deliver."
5208,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Wacky Track (2 pieces),0/0,5.0,"Ever find that you are just a little &#34;off&#34; when constructing your Thomas or Brio track masterpiece? Us, too. These track pieces are PERFECT! So nice to be able to go a little crazy with the track and not pay the price of it not connecting at the end. My 6 year old son is in love with these."
5209,Zippo Lighter Fluid 12OZ.,0/0,5.0,"Um, it's burns. It works. Not much to review on this one. Buy it, put it in lighter, and it works."

Great for role play and imagination, hopefully she will play with them for a long time to come. I recommend for children of all ages.So impressed I bought them for friends children as well."
5212,The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),0/0,4.0,"Cats really do LOVE this toy. I wish the string was better quality - even when the cat isn't trying to chew it, it frays and eventually breaks. Also, the pole has small plastic caps on the ends that can fall off and become a hazard to a hungry feline. The feathers are great, no complaints. Buy this product and make your cat happy."
5213,Macadamia Deep Repair Masque,0/0,5.0,I will never stop buying this product . it is the best thing ever for damaged or colored or even a healthy hair . It makes the hair wonderful . One tip for you ladies to use it as a conditioner to get the best results ever .

5217,Tetra AquaSafe Water Conditioner with BioExtract,0/0,5.0,"I used the sample pack that came with the fish tank and it works very well, looking forward to using this product in my tank. :)"
5218,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,0/0,5.0,Just purchased my second one! Still great as ever! I will never go back to tampons again. This is a godsend- it's so easy to use and I never had any problems using it. Every women should know about this alternative option for making that time of the month much easier. Saves a lot of money too.
5219,"The First Years Learning Curve Rolling Giggle Pal, Ages 0+ 1 ea / styles may vary",0/0,1.0,this is the dumbest infant toy ever! mine was recd broke! now I have to send it back which is a pain. not worth more than $5
5220,Batman Deluxe Vinyl Statue by Kotobukiya,0/0,5.0,"all the details of batman are realistic, as you would expect. attention to detail is fantastic. I proudly display it on the fireplace mantle"
5221,Munchkin Teething Blanket with Pacifier Attachment,0/0,2.0,"I was looking for something that my baby could hold and snuggle and I could attach my own paci of choice to, this seemed to be a great idea however the product itself is lacking. The pacifier attachment is difficult, you can't easily remove the paci to clean, I'm actually afraid I'd break the elastic if I tried it again. I also liked the idea of a silky side but it looks terrible. I washed it on gentle and let it air dry before giving it to my baby and all the silk starting unraveling then so I trimmed those threads. After my baby has grabbed at it for a day its all snagged. I give it two stars bc its a great idea but the materials used are so poor I doubt it will last more than a week more."
5222,"Precious Cat Cat Attract Problem Cat Training Litter, 40 pound bag",0/1,5.0,"We have three cats. When we got the second one she used the litter box just fine to pee, but did the other in the bathtub. When we inherited the third, she stopped using it altogether, no matter how many boxes I had in the house or how often they were cleaned. We'd resigned ourselves to making her an outside kitty when I found this stuff on Amazon. It works. It works too well. Now all three cats use the one box with this specific litter in it. I've taken to just using it in all four recently. Honestly, the price isn't that bad. I was using World's Best which all the cats liked save for the problem child, but problem child didn't like any kind of litter I used sides this stuff. Whatever makes them happy makes me happy at this point and this is actually cheaper than what I was getting. I do wish Amazon had it on prime. So far, covers odor pretty well, but I clean them every time I see it needs to be done. Definitely worth trying if you have a cat that refuses to use a box. It has done wonders."
5223,"Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser, 5-Ounce Tube",0/0,5.0,"This is the only face wash I use consistently. (But only once a day, otherwise it's too drying). My adult acne is controlled with a benzyl peroxide cream at night and this facewash in the morning."

5226,Radio Flyer Big Red Classic Atw,0/0,5.0,"It was shipped in the original Radio Flyer box, so if this is for a child that lives with you, keep that in mind. It was for our grandson and he loved it."
5227,"Twizzlers Pull 'n' Peel Candy, Cherry, 2.2-Ounce Packages (Box of 36)",0/0,5.0,This is my favorite flavor or Twizzlers. The normal strawberry flavor tastes so plastic to me while Cherry tastes fresh and delicious!
5228,Maybelline Dream Mousse Blush .2 oz (5.75 g),0/0,3.0,"a bit more golden shimmer to it than i would like but what can i say, i like this blush. it has a great texture and can look natural and fresh if applied the right way"
5229,Parent Units Fridge Guard,0/0,1.0,I like the design but the build quality leaves something to be desired. It cracked in one day and completely snapped in two days. Perhaps a different plastic next time..
5230,"Osmond Horned Owl 6.5"" by Aurora",0/0,5.0,This is a pretty little owl. It looks like a horned owl. It is very soft and very squishy.I saw the other review that said the eyes were crooked. That was not the case in this owl. It is very lovely with no problems.We bought it for my niece and we almost kept it because it is so cute.Enjoy.

Botanic Choice is probably not as good, partly because of their price but also because they add food coloring (titanium dioxide), which is totally unnecessary. Jarrow Formulas and PrimaFORCE Max are probably not as good, partly because of their prices but more because their %CLA is lower than the industry standard of 80%. The unwanted fatty acids that comprise the remaining 20% to 30% will definitely cause weight gain and may very likely also increase our risk of death from cancer."

These are so hard to find but thanks to Amazon for providing a seller that makes this product available for those of us in the US that are addicted to Lakerol. I keep a pack handy in my purse, at home and at work. They help soothe your throat and the best part is that they are sugar free. I love the Casis but they do come in other flavors. Why not give them a try! You won't be disappointed."

This stuff DOES produce crunchiness & stiff clumps, but after working, carefully, with it..I does help with hold. I use it on humid days."
5235,LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,0/0,3.0,"My mother bought this for my 9 mo son as a Christmas gift. He LOVES it! I think it's a great toy overall, esp. the bilingual switch. I just thought I would warn people that it is not stable. Once we put the legs on, he pulled himself up to a standing position (which he does on a daily basis) and in a matter of minutes, he pulled the table towards himself, went flying backwards and the table came down over him and rolled across his body. He wasn't hurt, just looked a little dazed. The way we have solved the problem is to push it into a corner, so the pressure of his body pushes it towards the walls instead of pulling it towards him. It could still knock him over and roll across his body, but it is less likely to happen. He easily pushes the table along the wall as he plays with it because it just isn't stable. Being a FTM and not having a lot of experience with toys yet, I am honestly surprised this toy hasn't be recalled and/or that this problem has not been fixed. Certainly this has happened to other babies."

5237,Ty Beanie Baby Dora the Explorer (Styles and Colors may vary),1/1,5.0,Purchased this for my granddaughter who absolutely loves Dora the Explorer. Her eyes opened wide the minute she saw it and wouldn't let go of her. She loves it!
5238,Revitol Hair Removal Cream (1 ~ 4 ounce Tube),0/0,3.0,I am not big on using removal cream but this one seems to be as good as any. I still get the rash that I was hoping to avoid.
5239,Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,5.0,"I use this product regularly and just recently discovered I can buy it on Amazon for less than through my consultant. This is a great product for light coverage, but not full coverage. For me, it's perfect, but be aware that if you are looking for a full coverage, thicker make-up, this is not for you. I like a natural look, not caked on make up so this is a great product for me and lasts a good 6 months with daily use."
5240,Gnip Gnop,0/0,5.0,"Great game, still have it, still going strong. My grandson and I play for hours. If it tears up someday, this classic toy will still be available I'm sure."

5245,CHAMPION Neoprene Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Hinged Bars,0/0,3.0,"The stabilizer kept slipping down my leg. I wouldn't recommend this item, and have found that a cane is my best relief for removing stress on the knee."
5246,Nicole Miller by Nicole Miller for Men 0.33 oz Eau de Toilette Travel Spray,0/0,5.0,perfect recived on time..thanks all was perfect .. recomed all people muchas gracias estuvo en tiempo y forma..estoy satisfecho
5247,Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,0/0,5.0,It is a good size for a baby and a little teadous to fill with water but I'm sure that is so it won't leak out. So far she loves it. It came quickly and other people that have seen it want one for a little one in their life.
5248,PediaSure Part no. 58058 ROSS PRODUCTS DIVISION,0/0,4.0,My son who is a very picky eater loves this. One of the only supplements he will have when he chooses not to eat. I would suggest Boost Kid Essentials to the money conscious shopper however as it is cheaper and contains the same nutrients but is not as sweet as the Pediasure.
5249,Diaper Dude Diaper Bag,0/0,5.0,This is a great gift for new dads. It has adequate storage pockets and is fashionable. We have also appreciated the durability of the material and that it's well made. The only thing that might make it better is if it were machine washable.
5250,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,1/1,5.0,I couldn't figure out why I couldn't find a massager in the stores. I recently started a workout regimen and needed this for sore muscles. Works great!
5251,Ettore 61054 Wipe and Dry 18-Inch Floor Squeegee with Wood Handle,0/0,3.0,For the plastic part inside base. It is where the handle screws in to this plastic receptor inside the metal housing on the squeegee part. It just is made of cheap plastic and breaks easily. The squeegee works fantastically well however.
5252,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,4.0,I bought this because I typically just shave my head every time I need a hair cut and occasionally do touch ups around the back of my neck. This razor works great and has saved me tons of money I would have spent at a barber shop. Also great for whenever any of my pals need a shape-up. Would recommend.
5253,Melissa & Doug Alphabet Train Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"Our son (just turned four) loves this puzzle. It helps that he likes trains, animals, and is learning his alphabet. We own several Melissa and Doug puzzles, including four floor puzzles for kids. Every one of them has withstood the tests of time and kids. I would recommend them."
5254,Four Piece Round Card Holder Set,1/1,5.0,I bought two of these. One for the wife and one for her to give as a gift. Was very happy on both counts.
5255,Petstages Cheese Chase Ball Track for Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"My cat loves this! First she tried to hold down the cute catnip mouse to smell the catnip but the string wouldnt let her, it was so cute then i had to show her that if u hit the ball it would go around and now she hits it and tries to pull it out. this is cute and cool! a must have!"
5256,Barbie Store It All - Pink,0/0,5.0,Bought for great-granddaughter and the minute she saw it she loved it. Has not put it down.. Has great storage space..
5257,Clairol Shimmer Lights Original Conditioning Shampoo,0/0,4.0,"On white, bleached on high-lighted hair this product is great at toning down any brassiness. Watch out if your hair ends are dry as they may absorb more color."
5258,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,1.0,"Ask plenty of questions about product and merchandise as these items appear new in picture, but merchandise clearly been used or were tester products."
5259,R-7 Liquid Bandage Spray 4 Ounce,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my dog, who has since gone to doggy heaven due to a severe infection on his skin. This was used daily to stop the bleeding when he scratched open his wounds. I found this locally but they wanted 'an arm and a leg for it' at the name brand pet store supply. So i searched and Amazon had it cheap, almost 'bogo' pricing compared to local pricing."
5260,"Now Foods, CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) 800 mg",8/8,5.0,"Metabolic Response Modifiers (MRM) ""CLA 1250"" contains 1250mg of safflower oil per softgel of which 1000mg is CLA. That's 80% CLA. Priced at $20.37 for 180 softgels, that's $1.132 for every 10,000mg of CLA.NOW Foods ""CLA 800mg"" contains 1000mg of safflower oil per softgel of which 800mg is CLA. That's 80% CLA.

That's 70% CLA. Priced at $15.19 for 180 softgels, that's $1.206 for every 10,000mg of CLA.Assuming these prices don't change, MRM is a slightly better deal than NOW Foods. Botanic Choice is probably not as good, partly because of their price but also because they add food coloring (titanium dioxide), which is totally unnecessary. Jarrow Formulas and PrimaFORCE Max are probably not as good, partly because of their prices but more because their %CLA is lower than the industry standard of 80%. The unwanted fatty acids that comprise the remaining 20% to 30% will definitely cause weight gain and may very likely also increase our risk of death from cancer."
5261,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"my cat Bob loves this toy/scratcher a lot. he plays with it at night & scratches this instead of the couch, most of the time"

5263,Lite-Brite Cube,1/1,1.0,"What a waste of money this was! I bought this for my daughter, based on happy memories of Lite Brite from decades past, but she can't play with it, because it's unusable. Every aspect of this toy is terrible. One can scarcely differentiate between green and yellow pegs, and between pink and orange pegs. The pegs only go in with extreme effort, and then proceed to fall right back out, especially when one is pushing in more pegs. This toy is designed so terribly, I can't believe it's an actual Hasbro toy. It seems like a chintzy no-name knock-off. I cannot stress enough how NOT worth anyone's money this toy is. Absolute hunk of garbage."
5264,"Revlon New Complexion Makeup, 1.2-Ounce",0/0,5.0,I have used this product for over ten years and am very disappointed that Revlon discontinued it. Thank goodness I found it on line. I ordered three bottles.
5265,Nature's Way Capsicool Cayenne,0/0,3.0,"I'm a believer in cayenne benefits---but the protective formulation here does not prevent 30 minutes of heartburn---tolerable if I take with food, and only one capsule at a time, really nasty if I take two on an empty stomach. Might be more gentle than the standard pure formulation, but you couldn't prove that by me."
5266,Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion 2.2 Oz & Peel System Skin Care 2.0 Fl Oz,68/69,4.0,"Olay knows how to make skin care products. The peel does precisely what it's intended to do. It clears my face, gives me a fresh look. I'm thrilled right after I take it off. But it's a chemical peel- by the next day, I feel dry. The product works, it really does, but it doesn't provide enough moisture for my skin to keep it glowing after the peel process settles. The solution to that problem? I tried all kinds of creams- they left me feeling heavy. My friend recommended a retinol cream which I fell in love with -. I like to keep as light and natural as possible, and it seems to do the trick. There are tons of options out there but if you're like me and you like to go 100% natural, then here's my suggestion:Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set. Its a thick cream but still absorbs really good so I'm not constantly reapplying. It keeps my skin healthy and glowing after using the peel and each day until I decide to peel again. I'm not flaky or strained anymore after using it. My hands don't get greasy and my pores aren't clogged either."
5267,Roux Fanci-full Mousse #18 Spun Sand,0/0,4.0,"I bought this because I needed to cover gray roots of my permanently colored hair.I wanted something gentle as my hair is fragile. I put a small amount on the roots and combed through. It blended the color nicely and even covered some gray. It is hard to find non-permanent color these days, so I was glad to find this."
5268,Aqua Mist Add-A-Stone Aerating Aquarium Ornaments,0/0,5.0,Used it for a different application but certainly did the job and was priced affordable should last for many years to come
5269,Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer,0/0,5.0,I ordered this item for my first baby on the way :) It looks just like the pic and I'd say is a little bigger than an I phone so it fits comfortably in my hand. So excited to try it out thanks!
5270,Elegant Baby Squirties,0/0,1.0,"We got these for our 6 month old to play with during bath time. I boiled them to sterilize (which you should be able to do with toys that will end up in your baby's mouth), but the paint started rubbing off from one toy onto the other. Don't see a need for extra paint on a toy that will be chewed on. Will not give these to my daughter as she would get toxic paint in her mouth."
5271,Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning,0/0,5.0,Was given as a gift to a teen. She loves it. This is normally a good product. I'm sure it will perform as described although I haven't spoken to her since she received it. I will post an update future.
5272,"PRI Folding Potty with Handles, White granite",1/1,4.0,This seat is actually better than the reviews would suggest. Our son is near the top % of height and about avg on weight % for his age (2yrs). He is able to use this easily and it holds his weight fine. It does look flimsy when he sits on it but it never falls in or breaks. We love it because it sits at the front of the toilet seat so he doesn't end up touching anything gross on the seat with the back of his legs. It folds up pretty small and we're able to keep it in the purse (we keep it in a bag of it's own so it doesn't dirty anything in the bigger bag it is in).Only con is how light weight it is. it is a little flimsy so our son does seem a little uneasy sitting on it sometimes. It does have handles he grabs onto so that keeps him safe.
5273,Ty Beanie Babies - Tracker the Basset Hound Dog,0/0,5.0,Great little dog for child to take to bed and soft and really cut expression on its face. Child just loves it.
5274,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,0/0,5.0,This is by far the best product I have come across for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). It is amazing how effective this works simply by altering the angle that the tendon pulls on the bone. If you have this condition and nothing else has worked you owe it to yourself to try this!
5275,Panasonic Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries - 8 Pack,0/0,5.0,"No complaints about these AA batteries. Reasonably priced, good to have on hand. Good performance, long lasting. Not much more to say, they're batteries, afterall. But I would definitely buy Panasonic brand again."
5276,Source Naturals Activated Quercetin,0/0,5.0,"I have been using this product for 4 yrs now. I don't use any prescribed meds anymore because of this product. What the majority of the reviews say are true but everyone's body make up is different. If you suffer from any type of allergies, look no further this may help you."
5277,Nature's Way Red Raspberry,4/4,5.0,I dont know if it was the pills or not but when i started labor i didnt know i was in labor. i felt contractions but they didnt hurt. It wasnt until that night when I was at a 10 on the pain scale that they hurt. I labored for 7 hours. my doula said i was at a 10 the entire time and you could see the contractions! I think the pills are the reason my uterus was so strong!
5278,FlashMaster,1/1,5.0,"Kicks flashcards to the trash. This little gem is a no-nonsense practice your math facts machine! NO distractions, either. NO internet option looming on the screen. NO video game icons calling your names. Nope. Just the facts, mam. Math facts. It's durable and kid tested tough, too. We've dropped this little dude over and over again on the tile (maybe on purpose?) and 4 kids later, it is still delivering what it promises"
5279,Brake-Fast Dog Food Slow Feed Bowl - Small Red,0/0,3.0,It probably slowed down my Corgi by all of about 2.2 seconds. She gets her pointy little nose right in between the knobs on the dish and still inhales the food.

I catch myself wondering ""mmm, what smells so good?"" and it's ME!! This is pheromone-free (unless you choose to add pheros) but you'd never know it - it attracts like nothing else!! I will never let myself run out of this!!"
5284,Cadbury Fruit & Nut Chocolate Bar 49g England (12 Pack),0/0,5.0,I spent three years in England during the 50's. An English gentleman came through our barracks selling Cadbury's chocolate bars. I thought they were the best I had ever tasted. And still do! These bars may be a bit smaller but just as good!
5285,NOW Foods Calcium/magnesium 1000/500 mg,0/0,5.0,This is a product that I have been using in addition to my adult one-a-day and it makes a perfert balance. The one-a-days have everything in them except a sufficient amount of calcium & magnesium. I also get it here for a good discount.
5286,"PetSafe Stubborn Dog In-Ground Fence, PIG00-10777",0/0,4.0,"Worked fine, took a little tweaking to get the range of action right. All of the listed items were in the box. Hard to tell when the shock collar battery is running down. Need to replace it on a calendar."

5289,Walthers SceneMaster - Bright Boy Abrasive Track Cleaner,0/0,4.0,"I use this for heavily pitted track issues. It does a great job. I will be purchasing more of these but a little trick for lesser pitted tracks is using the Scotch Brite Heavy duty scrub sponge with some track cleaner sprayed on it. Now for the biggest of jobs, rusty or very heavily pitted track I still use fine sand paper. I have some lay outs out doors so that is why I have the bigger of jobs from time to time."
5290,Melissa & Doug Underwater 48-Piece Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,the kids(3 and 5) and I had a great time put this together. it really pretty too. i think this puzzel will last for some time.
5291,LeapFrog Leapster Learning Game,0/0,4.0,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas who just turned four in November. Overall I was hesitant about buying the leapster 2 and a game I am not into giving children video games so young. However, I needed something that could keep her entertained at Church until the Children would go down for the Children service. The game itself offers five differant games there is only one that she can't quite get the hang of yet. I think as she grows though she will learn that one also. She loves the game where she gets to cook the recipes shes earned and enjoys &#34;cracking&#34; the eggs. Its a fun game but not so over the top that she vegetates with it all day which was my concern."
5292,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,5.0,"love it, good for my baby boy. He enjoys his time in this toy and does not want to get out."
5293,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"One of the best protein powder's I've tried. A little more expensive than say, the Costco Muscle Milk brand, but it's got a better taste, good consistency, and great combo of protein and supplements."
5294,Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"This was what one of my sons wanted for Christmas. I knew living 45 min. from OKC, I'd have better results and prices ordering from Amazon. He likes the gift and it saved me time and money!!!"

Cannot say enough about how good the shakes taste!! I mix mine in the blender with a lil ice and some heavy whipping cream. If you wanna have a low carb tasty treat buy this. Im liking the vanilla the best but the chocolate is good as well."

5316,"Quercetti Skyrail Mini Rail Rollercoaster, 150 Pieces",0/0,3.0,"I bought this for my son who absolutely loves marble mazes. Overall, this is a great concept. The twin rail design works great for the marbles. The rails are flexible, so you can make hills and valleys that alternately speed up or slow down the marbles throughout the run.We have purchased three different marble maze / coaster kits over the past couple of years. One is very basic, with fairly rigid pieces and is easy to set up. The second was ridiculously complicated to set up (over an hour and a 70-page manual for a single design), and it has some design flaws that you can't engineer around. So we were hoping for a ""bigger kid"" experience that had more design flexibility, durability, and reliability.PRO's"
5317,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,This is a gorgeous polish that far exceeded my already high expectations. This China Glaze polish has an amazing consistency and the small gold flecks make this pretty pink color gorgeous. It's a mature pink that is perfect for fingers or toes anytime of the year.

5322,Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,0/0,1.0,"This was one of my son's favorite gifts once we finally got the poorly made track to stay together. To my surprise, the train ran nicely in spite of the track trouble. Problems started when we tried to put the expensive rechargeable battery in the train, which I purchased separately. The plug inside the coal car for the 9.6 volt battery is not useable at all. I even took train car to Radio Shack to see if I was doing something wrong. After hours of trying to plug the battery-pack in, we finally got it! Only to find out, train won't power up at all - yes we charged the battery. So either we buy a lifetime supply of C batteries or, send it back. I was thinking about taking a chance on a second one. But after reading through some of the one-star reviews, in regard to price fluctuation on this train, maybe not. What a shame that Lionel does not make sure their product is tested before shipping it out. You think you're getting a namebrand quality item - I could've got this quality at the local discount retailer."
5323,Classic Cross-Hatched Hot Water Bottle- RED- Made in Germany,1/1,5.0,"I'm a knitter and I can't sleep when I'm cold so I end up buying a lot of hot water bottles & knitting cozies for them, either for myself or for gifts. These handsome, sturdy German bottles are a favorite of mine, and if you fill them absolutely full of just-off-boiling water they will keep you toasty all night.

5325,Ethical Stainless Steel Long-Ear Double Diner,0/0,1.0,"As the owner of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, I am always trying to locate a feeding/water dish that will work to keep the long ears clean and dry. So I bought these. Tried them one time - and the ears were in the food and water like any regular dish. Also the narrow bowl actually traps the ears closer to the dogs head - ergo - dirty wet ears. Like every other product I have tried for long ears - I won't ever buy again. Actually if you stand by your dog and keep pulling the ears out of the dishes that might work --- but you can do that with regular dishes......."
5326,American Baby Company 100% Cotton Supreme Jersey Knit Fitted Crib Sheet,0/0,4.0,"It is a nice warm knit sheet for the crib. Baby likes it and the colour is as shown. I like light colours so that the child is not distracted by dark colours. The only thing is that it is a little thin in quality of the knit fabric as others had pointed out. But, I am happy with it as it is warm."
5327,LEGO City Off Road Fire Rescue (7942),0/0,5.0,"LEGO is such a fun system to build with. Anyone who's life has never been touched by the joy of LEGO has never really lived.

5330,Malem Ultimate Bedwetting Alarm - Blue 1 Tone w/Vibration,1/1,5.0,"My son was 7 years old and still wetting the bed at night. He was starting to be self concious about it. He would soak a pull up and I thought there was no way this could work. I was afraid to committ because I didn't want interrupted sleepless nights....However, I must say, he did GREAT! The first few weeks were a bit rocky but in no time he was dry at night. The chart helped keep him involved and he would be so excited when he had a dry night. He has been dry for about 6 months. He just had an accident last night and it reminded me to get on here and give this product a great review. Because of it, the last 6 months have been great for him and for us. It gave him confidence and I wished I had heard of and bought it sooner. Stick with it and don't give up. Buy reusable bedpads to go with it. You won't believe what this product can do for your child. Just be consistent and stick with it."

5337,"Revolution Tea, 16 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",0/0,5.0,"they may run out if you do and I won't have it anymore! ;-) I drink this tea all day long in a big 16 oz tumbler that keeps it hot for hours. I take if all over. I bring it on trips and once I'm through the security point, I stop at Starbucks and get hot water and I'm ready for at least a 3 hour flight. If you like lavender, it has a slight lavender bouquet and it just gives it the most amazing flavor. I quit drinking coffee because of this tea. So please don't buy it, I wouldn't want them to run out!"

5340,Spine-Worx Back Realignment Device,0/0,5.0,"This product keeps my neck and spine limber between my monthly chiropractic visits. Great help for when your back goes out of whack, too. Yes, it is hard plastic, and may take some getting used to, but if you stick with it, you will find that once your back is where it needs to be, the Spineworx is not only painless, it is inviting. Whenever my back is stiff, sore or bothering me, I lay on this and feel much better. As you roll back onto it, your spine will gently &#34;pop&#34;, though not as powerfully as when you get adjusted by the chiropractor. I have found that I get the best result if my back pops a little, and then I lay on it and relax for 5 minutes... this gives the muscles a chance to let go of their stress. Highly recommend this product!"
5341,Umbrella Doll Stroller,0/0,3.0,"Although I like the stroller, I could see that my two year old granddaughter could easily pinch her fingers and get hurt on the sharp metal ends that should have been capped off with plastic lids."

5344,Premier Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"I have a yellow lab who can chew through almost anything. I had purchased smaller versions of this toy in the past, but he always chewed the ends to the point where they lasted only a couple weeks. This one he hasn't destroyed yet and he's had it for 3 weeks. It also takes him longer to get the rawhide discs chewed off. Best part yet- it's a great toy that doesn't squeak!"
5345,"Stubb's Herbal Mustard Rub, 3.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,I agree with your totally. This is the best rub on the market. Unfortunately I was not able to order or purchase from my local store any longer so I called Stubbs directly. This rub has been discontinued which I can not believe. The Women told me to try some of the new rubs so I did and they did not even come close to competing with Herbal Mustard or any of the other rubs. So disapointed. I wish more people would call them up and tell them they made a huge mistake stopping this rub. After all these years I will no longer be purchasing their products. Too Bad I was known to have the best chicken around with my local fire department.
5346,Invacare Reusable Bed Pads,0/0,5.0,Critical to use in tandem with a bed wetting alarm product such as the malem. Highly recommend getting one or two.

They are still fun and my daughter has a blast building with them but not even close to Tinker Toy territory in what you can build.

5350,Bell Bottle & Holder Guard Value Set - 8 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I have had several of these bottles over the years for my chinchillas. They are notorious chewers and before discovering this one, we went through dozens of styles trying to find one that would work for us (including glass). The bottle itself is hard plastic and will crack or shatter if dropped from a height or banged around too much, but it is not fun for him to chew on so that is why we stuck with it. I've only had one (of probably 6 or 7 I've owned) crack, and on this order the first one arrived shattered & was exchanged. The cap part that screws on is a softer plastic, and would be chewed on and ruined if he could get his little teeth anywhere near it, but the metal guard protects it and keeps him from getting to it."
5351,Burberry London By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounce,0/0,5.0,Smells great and the price is hard to beat. This same bottle costs $70 at the local mall. Will definately purchase again.
5352,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,0/0,5.0,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my one-year-old niece this year. Unfortunately I was not in town to see her open it and play with it, but I have seen the pictures and the video, and apparently she loves it. According to my sister, I &#34;won Christmas&#34; with this toy. She likes hitting the different squares and starts waving her arms like a little conductor and dancing to it. And from what I heard from the video, as many other reviewers have said, it is not nearly as annoying as many noise-making kids' toys. The music, though obviously &#34;electronic,&#34; sounds like actual music and not beeping or buzzing or any of the other irritating toy sounds. Hopefully she will continue to enjoy it."
5353,"Silver Plastic Toy Trumpet 16.5"" by Bontempi",0/0,4.0,I purchased this in a rush. This made my child happy as can be since all she asked Santa for was a trumpet. Luckily it arrived before Christmas as promised
5354,Handstands Cyber Gel Squeeze Ball - Colors may vary,0/0,2.0,"I bought this for a friend. He loved it, and played with it all the time. Well, a couple months of use later, the ball busted and he had to through it away and clean up the mess."
5355,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,2.0,"I love Seventh Generation products, especially the baby care products. They ate environment friendly and usually work really well, but these wipes were disappointing. They are extremely thin, so it's me 3 times as many wipes to get my little one clean. They are very small and have a very strange smell to them. Also, she has had mild diaper rash since using these wipes, and they were the only thing that changed. I only gave them two stars since they are cruelty free and vegan. Will not be buying these again."
5356,Nature's Plus Spiru-Tein High Protein Energy Meal,0/0,5.0,I like the nutients along with the protien. I like the vanilla consistency and texture. Protien shakes are all over. But they don't have the vitamins of Spirutein

5358,DOTTERS - dog,0/0,5.0,We have about 20 of these with this one being in the safe for safe keeping so when my son hopefully has kids I can give it to them.
5359,Trix HO Locomotive Wheel Cleaning Brush,0/0,5.0,"These are designed to interlock together so you can clean your larger engines all at once as you note in the diagram one will only cover one set of wheels at a time on standard engines. As another person pointed out do not press down on the engine. What I found works best for me is keep most of th weight off the engine for a few seconds while slowly lowering the engines full weight on the scrubber. You do need to hold the engine as it will power right on off the pads. This is the only way to really clean engine wheels that I know of, the way I did it before was with a wire brush which only gets the part of the wheels showing when removed from the track."
5360,Nylabone Dura Chew Bone,0/0,5.0,"This toy is long, but my bichon still like playing with it. Just not his favorite. Would be great for a medium dog."
5361,"PetSafe Stubborn Dog In-Ground Fence, PIG00-10777",0/0,5.0,We installed this fence and it works beautiful. I no longer have to worry about my Pug getting hit by a car or chasing the neighbors.
5362,Chiclets Peppermint Flavored Chewing Gum (20-12 piece pkgs),0/0,1.0,I keep hoping there will be one pack that is not stale. This package of gum is absolutely horrible. When I buy them in the store I can chew the gum for hours. This package of gum I can only chew for 15 to 30 minutes. I am so sorry I bought this gum. It is stale.
5363,Novpearls Dandruff Shampoo 12 Ounce Package - Part #,0/0,5.0,I use this stuff with my Blue Doberman (Holly). She has very finicky skin conditions and this shampoo is very good on her coat. I use it as part of &#34;Blue's Regimen&#34; (look it up on the internet for blue doberman skin conditions). Works well! Thanks!
5364,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,3.0,the Furminator works well. I have a Huskey and he has a heavy coat and it does help some with cutting down on the shedding by keeping him brushed good
5365,gloMinerals gloEye Shadow,0/0,5.0,"I love these eyeshadows...always velvety and they don't crease or make my eyelids look crepey! I'm getting close to 50, so it can be difficult to find something that does all of those things, but Glo Minerals shadows always fit the bill"
5366,Clips Metal Single Prong 80 Count,1/1,5.0,Bought these to make bows with. Works great. Fast shipping and exactly what I expected. Good deal on the price for the amount of clips you get too.

5368,ZOOB 55-Piece Basic Set,0/0,5.0,"Our grandson loves to make long chains and then pull them apart, he will probably learn to make animals and stuff later."
5369,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,I got this on Christmas for my 9-yr-old girl cousins. They loved it and immediately started building projects from the manual -- I spent about 2 hours playing with them because I loved this toy so much myself. They said it reminded them of science class. Indeed it did the same for me.The kids got really excited when they completed the first project (creating a light with the switch). They wanted to skip right to creating the AM radio.
5370,Derma Wand Kit,10/10,1.0,"Bought it mid September 2012, never got dropped / anything but suddenly quit working last week. Called their customer service, without asking question to diagnose what the problem it might be, she just said, it's the bulb and that is not covered under warranty. You have to ship the unit back to us & pay $25 for the bulb plus $9.99 for us to ship back the unit to you. NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS!!! And they said they have 10 years warranty, on WHAT? It could be the electrical item in the unit, who knows? But without even diagnosing they just said it's the part that isn't covered under warranty. What A Warranty. Totally disappointed,!"
5371,My First Lab Duo-Scope Microscope,0/0,5.0,"We bought this for our 6 year old granddaughter who is crazy for science. I bought it based on reviews that it was good quality and that the microscope did truly have lens that would let you see detail. It actually turns so that there are three viewing options when looking thru the microscope. We looked at many things - the human hair, skin, leaves, and a slide kit that had many different interesting things to look at. It says it is good for up to 18 year olds. I think it is a great starter microscope. It seems good sturdy quality and yet it is lightweight enough that is is easy for the little ones to handle."
5372,Elchim 2001 Professional Hair Dryer (Elchim Classic),0/0,5.0,"I have weirdly wavy, long, very thick hair. With other (cheap) dryers, it takes me 20+ minutes to dry my hair, and another 15 to flat iron it if I want it straight. I never quite understood why my stylist didn't have the same problems when she styled my hair. Now I know"
5373,"PetSafe Heated Wellness Sleeper, Small, Hunter Green/Sand",0/0,5.0,"Works like a champ. Not to much heat, just enough for their enjoyment. I can't feel the heat when it's not being used but when I put my hand under one of the cats who happens to be sleeping in it, nice and warm feeling. I have four cats and all of them take their turn using it. Took the little girl about a week before she decided it was time to try it out and now she's queen of the sleeper, the boys have to wait till she removes herself from the throne. Thinking about getting another one so the boys don't feel left out...."
5374,Pill Crusher -Pill Pulverizer,1/1,5.0,If you need a pill crusher that works good this one does the job. It is light and made of strong polypropylene and last a long time. If you have pills to crush and take sublingually it does a good job. Highly recommend this product.
5375,"Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Sleeve for Hand, Wrist, Elbow, 5.5"" x 7""",0/0,5.0,"I first became aware of this product at Physical Therapy sessions. Having had two hand surgeries to relieve the hand distortions of osteoarthritis, this microwaveable sleeve relieves aches or tightness. I liked it so much that I purchased one for my hairdresser who of course works with her hands each and every day. She thanks me every time I see her. I think that speaks for itself. I would recommend this to everyone who needs hand, wrist or elbow relief."
5376,Perler Beads Sunny Days Activity Bucket,0/0,5.0,"We bought this for our 5 year old neice for Christmas, but our 12 year old neice was the one to play with it. Not sure if it was too tough for the 5 year old or if she just didn't want to try it out that day. The 12 year old had fun with the beads and making a design though. The little tool that it comes with to help pick up didn't seem all that helpful...as our older neice said it was just easier to pick beads up with her fingers."
5377,Archipelago Botanicals Morning Mint Hydrating Lotion,0/0,5.0,"I first was given a sample of the hand creme for this Morning Mint lotion and loved the smell. I really like that this lotion does not contain any parabens, while the hand creme does. I can't get enough of this scent!"
5378,Barbie Dolls of the World,0/0,2.0,I was very disappointed in this doll. Does not have much going for it and highly overpriced. She still hasn't been taken out of the box.
5379,California Exotics Waterproof Vibro Dolphin Massager,0/0,3.0,"It works for it's intended purpose, but even a brand new battery doesn't last more than 5-10 minutes. Invest in rechargeables!!! Or you may be feeling very, ahem, frustrated. Other than that, not a bad product for the price paid."
5380,Chuckit! Ball Launcher,0/0,5.0,"This Ball launcher throws the ball a little shorter than the original ball launcher--which is perfect for me because I live in a subdivision with 1/2 acre lot and not a big field. The handle is comfortable, I only have to bend slightly to pick up a ball off the ground since the Chuckit! will grab and hold onto it (with the longer/originial one, you wouldn't have to bend at all.You can use regular sized tennis balls with this so you don't have to buy expensive proprietary balls--although one does come with it.With that said, my dog doesn't like it. But it isn't Chuckit!'s fault. He just isn't into tennis balls. He instead, insists on the Chuckit! KickballChuckit! Large Kick Fetch BallBut, if you have a dog that loves tennis balls, BUY THIS THING!!!!!! I'm so sad I didn't discover it while my other dog was still alive. It is the best thing ever for a tennis ball chasing dog and it wears them out faster without wearing you out! It is fantastic!!"

5383,"Spenco 2nd Skin Squares, 200 Gel Squares",0/0,5.0,My sons' play soccer year round and this is excellent for blisters. The only thing that has worked for them. They wrap with a band aid and sports wrap after applying it.
5384,Clinique Long Last Soft Shine Lipstick,0/0,5.0,"The color is great, a nice neutral. The shine is good. The moisture is good. It lasts a long time. It's everything you want in a lipstick."
5385,Amazon.com,0/0,3.0,"good pure white color, covers well. mixes well with all other colors.difficult to use for clean lines & accents, texture is think. thinning with more water is not enough."

5389,"Kama Sutra- Massage Therapy Kit, 1ct",0/0,5.0,This massage oil is good and good aroma. My wife is a dental hygienist and her back and feet always seem to be tired and this product was very smooth.
5390,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,"This was wider than I realized, so I should have measured it before ordering. But my 5 year old lab Stella (60 lbs.) loves it! So we're keeping it. One size smaller would have probably worked. But the large size is big enough where Stella's bed fits on top and she is not laying on top of the perimeter support bars.Good purchase. Very sturdy. Does not move on the floor when Stella jumps on and off of it. Top canvas/fabric part is very strong and sags only slightly when Stella is on top of it, so Stella seems to feel secure and comfortable laying on top of it.Color is darker than it appears in the picture -- it's more of a medium to dark green color in most lighting. Only in very bright lighting, it resembles the blue/green pictured on Amazon."
5391,Vanderbilt By Gloria Vanderbilt For Women. Sparkling Light Body Mist,0/0,5.0,This is a wonderful and perfect price for a nice smell. This is my favorite product which I try to keep on hand all the time.
5392,Mon Cheri Liquor Filled Chocolate Covered Cherries 30 count,0/0,5.0,"The candies were a wonderful treat. I'm glad that I've found a source to purchase them from. &#34;American-style&#34; Mon Cheri candies are delicious, but not the same."
5393,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,0/0,4.0,"I was definitely surprised with this. I wasn't sure how many pieces it was going to come in. But it was very easy to assemble; my boyfriend did it in a matter of 10 min tops. It has 2 different heights, so it grows with your child. We haven't tried out the chalkboard part yet, but I am aware that it might not work that well. However, after reading further reviews you can use chalkboard paint just as well. I am thoroughly impressed with this item!! Well worth the money."
5394,Exclusively Pet Best Buddy Bits,0/0,5.0,We use these for training and treating our dogs. There are really small so perfect for repeating training commands. Our dogs are Yorkie-poodle mixes so one is 4lbs and the other is 6.5lbs.
5395,Lamaze Musical Inchworm,0/0,5.0,"Easy to clean, it's 24 inches long and easy for an infant to hold on to it (3 month old). Only flaw is the cheap sounding melody it plays."
5396,K&H 3093 Extreme Weather Kitty Pad with Fleece Cover,0/0,5.0,received just in time for the snow storm we got and the stry cat loves it cant get him/her off of it
5397,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Mighty Builders Fire Truck,0/0,5.0,My six year old son and I had a good time building this fire engine and it went together very well. All of the pre-drilled holes lined up and the finished product looks great. My son is having a fun time playing with the ladder going up and down and the wheels roll wonderfully. I would recommend this toy for any parent who has a hands on child.
5398,ThinkFun Zingo,0/0,5.0,"I bought this at a local store for Christmas for my son who will turn 4 in a few months. We have played it now three times in the last few days and even my daughter who turns 2 tomorrow is able to play...and kinda good at it!Each Zingo game card has two sides, a green and a red. The red is supposed to be more challenging so we have only played the green side so far. I play the dealer, who slides the red box to reveal 2 of the yellow plastic word tags at a time. The mechanism is easy to work and both my kids can do it but it's easier if I'm the dealer to keep them from being distracted. Also the tags are difficult to slide back into the dispenser one at a time through the slots. Both kids help put them in when the lid is off - they are rounded one one end and flat on the other making it easy to see which direction they face.Play is fun and it only takes about 15 minutes for someone to win, though with two toddlers we play until everyone ""wins"". My son is just starting to read and I hope that continued play helps him with his reading to link the word with the picture. My daughter easily recognizes each picture, even ""smile"", and calls them out by name, though she is not reading at all. They don't always remember what they are looking for and sometimes call out the name of whatever tag comes up even though they don't need that to make a match, but again I love the reinforcement of the picture names and words.My husband hasn't played this with us yet because we've played it while he's at work but I love that this is a game we can all play as a family. I look forward to a family game night!Santa brought us Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land too. Chutes and ladders was confusing and disinteresting to the 2 yr old and took the 4 yr old quite a few turns before he kinda got the idea. It didn't hold their attention. Candyland was more fun and very easy for both to understand since there is no counting involved. They did great, but the 2 year old again got distracted and left before game was over. Zingo kept both kids interested so I give it the best rating of these for toddlers!!!"
5399,Munchkin Fun Ice Chewy Teether,0/0,5.0,"This is a great teether. My son was able to handle it well, even at a young age. He chewed on it even when it wasnt frozen. I also liked that there as a hole in the center so you could hook a pacifier chain or whatever in order to attach it to a car seat or highchair, Etc."

5403,"Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Gel, 4 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"My husband has all kinds of allergies, and certain times of the year his legs will itch. A friend had given me one of these bottles because they had extra. My husband tried it one day in desperation, and finally, some relief from his strange, seasonal leg itching! The price is great for stocking up for an itchy guys big ol' hairy legs. Works great for other normal itches, too."

5407,VTech - Move & Crawl Electronic Activity Ball,0/0,5.0,"First off, let me say that I'm not a big reviewer. I usually only leave reviews if I love it or if I hate it. I LOVE this ball, and so does my baby! First off, it has volume control, two distinctive levels that truly are different. On the lower level, it still entertains my son without waking my sleeping husband, who works nights. Also, the buttons are so sensitive that my 3-month-old son can press them and make it sing. His face lights up when this ball sings! The voice is super-cute! The ball rolls and rolls all around. It works better on the hardwoods, doesn't go very far on the rug, but I bet it would do well in a playpen. My son cannot crawl yet, but he tries his hardest to get to the ball during his tummy time; it actually occupies him during tummy time so he stays down there a little longer. We also use it to practice sitting him up, as he sits up and presses the buttons and moves the ladybug on the top of the ball for a good 10 minutes (which is GREAT for him!). This ball is truly a joy! You won't regret this purchase!"
5408,Burberry Brit ~ Women 3.3 oz / 100 ml Eau de Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,I love this perfume! It's not strong but long lasting. I use this as my signature scent. Everyone always compliments me on it.The regular shipping was fast and seamless. You gotta love Amazon for that. I got it within two days from ordering.I would definitely recommend!
5409,"Lixit Dog Water Bottle, 64-Ounce",0/0,1.0,"I was going to return this product but unfortunately I had placed it somewhere and couldn't find it again until too late. Put it together and hung it on the puppies excercise pen. It constantly leaked, never properly sealed."
5410,Biotene Dental Products Biotene Oralbalance Dry Mouth Moisturizer Gel,0/0,3.0,"I like to use it at night, when I wake up in the middle of the night and experience dry mouth. It's usually effective though not as effective as other products I have used. It's effects don't last more than an hour if so long."
5411,Helen of Troy 1190 Professional Flat Iron,0/0,5.0,I love my hot tools they are so great! these are my favorite flat irons. For some reason this is the best size the smaller ones I dont like as much so these are great!
5412,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,I picked this product because it was the best value out there. I couldn't find greenies for cheaper at the store.
5413,Gerber Waterproof Pants (4 pairs),0/0,3.0,"I ordered these for my 2 year old, to go over his diaper at night because he often 'leaks' through his night time diaper. I put this on him and checked him in the middle of the night and he had already leaked through and had red marks on his legs from the elastic. I was not impressed and ended up throwing them out."
5414,Meclizine Chewable Tablets - 25mg - Model 85207 - Btl of 100,0/0,4.0,I have been using the Rugby brand of travel sickness pills now for over ten years. My daughter who is a nurse introduced me to them way back when. I have recommended them to many others who have not been successful in finding a good travel pill. I don't know what I would do without them. Just got back from another 7 day cruise with no worries about being queasy!
5415,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,0/0,3.0,I'm still trying this product out and I'm not sure how I feel about the purchase yet. the item did come in quick.
5416,Revivogen Shampoo and Conditioner Value Pack,0/0,5.0,"Having a Father and two older brothers that went completely bald by the age of 20, I was conscious about my hair from a very young age. Over the years I have literally tried just about every shampoo, conditioner, styling product and supplement on the market. With Revivogen, 5% Rogain Foam, 1mg daily of Finasteride and Aveda Grooming Clay (for daily styling) I have finally found the perfect combination in fighting hair loss. At age 35, my hair is finally back to being just as thick as when I was 16 (full head of hair). I even use Rogaine on my temples and frontal hair line and it's always worked very well for me (initial shedding phase takes patience, don't give up!).As others have mentioned, this product does dry out he scalp a little bit, so be sure to use Nizoral once or twice a week to fight dandruff (it's also good for battling hair loss). My Wife tends to have thinning hair in her upper scalp region and it gets really bad when she uses store brands (diluted garbage and is sure to contribute to hair loss). Since she's been using Revivogen shampoo and conditioner her hair is full, shiny and you can't see through to her scalp even in the sunlight like before. We are Revivogen users for life and will never switch.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!"

5418,Melissa & Doug Sports Bag Fill & Spill,0/0,4.0,My grandson really enjoys playing with this and loves to put the toys in and then take them out. Nice soft toys that are good for chewing on and also won't do much damage when thrown (as we know babies like to do)
5419,Multipet Look Who's Talking Frog Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"My dog loves all furry toys that squeak but, when I found this stuffed frog that makes &#34;realistic&#34; sounds, my dog went crazy over it. I have purchased through a pet store the duck and cow, but will need to buy new ones since my dog has played/chewed those toys to bits. I will eventually order a new cow and duck online through Multipet and possibly a few of their other items that make realistic-type sounds."
5420,Bug-Opoly Monopoly Board Game,0/0,3.0,The &#34;houses&#34; and &#34;hotels&#34; are cheap plastic cubes and pne trees (they call the oak trees?). This could have been better.
5421,Heather's Tummy Fiber POUCH Organic Acacia 16 oz. for Irritable Bowel Syndrome,0/0,2.0,"All this product did was give me a temporary peace of mind.. It did nothing to ease my IBS.. Though, perhaps I am a special case. In my honest opinion"
5422,Nature's Way Milk Thistle,0/0,5.0,I used it as a liver cleanse and standardized means you get Milk Thistle in it's purest form. Worked well for me!
5423,1/24 RC 3-Ch Remote Control M1A2 Abrams Tank,0/0,2.0,"I bought this primarily for indoor play. Turns out it's not really suitable for it - at least not in my house. The instructions warn against using it on carpet! We still checked it out, to try and decide if we wanted a similar toy that worked on carpet, or one of the alternatives. For that little bit, it worked ok. No problems with tread loss that others reported. The BB gun loaded and fired as per the instructions. There were some reception problems, but it's not clear if that was range or interference from a nearby computer. If it was a radio range, it was maybe 15 feet, which would be a serious issue outdoors.The things that set this one apart from the others we had considered were all disappointments. The choice came down to one of the BB-firing tanks with an canon that could be elevated, or an IR canon with a life counter of some kind suitable for simulating battles. The BB gun fires at sufficient velocity that tracking shots inside is nearly impossible, so we're not going to look for another of those. The gun elevation isn't really controllable. There's one button that elevates it to the top of the (rather limited) range, then lowers it to the bottom, then back up, and so on, instead of one button for up and one for down. Sort of pointless, and not at all fun. The demo mode is mildly amusing, but hitting the button by accident while trying to go forward happened sufficiently often that leaving off the demo feature would have been an improvement.Driving the tank itself was also a bit of a loss. While the motors driving the treads have two speeds in both directions, you can't really use all the possibilities. Turning is limited to one tread going while the other is still (basically pivoting around the still tread) or having them go in opposite directions (spinning in place). While having two rates of spin seems a little pointless, having the ability to shift one tread into high gear while the other stays at normal speed - resulting in a turn while moving forward - would have been a major improvement in the toy.The programming aspect looked like it might be fun, but that was a bust as well. It doesn't move while recording a program, so you can't tell what it's doing. When you record a move, pressing a button triggers the selected action for a preset amount of time, which you can't change by, for instance, holding down the button. The turns come out at almost 180 degrees. You can't even replicate the demo mode programs with it.I seriously considered giving this tank one star, but it wasn't broken or completely useless out of the box - just where I wanted to use it. So it gets two stars, with a warning about not using it in most houses."
5424,GeoCentral Box of Rocks Kit,0/0,5.0,Great assortment of rocks. Comes with a small book describing the collection. My 24 year old daughter who loved and collected rocks when she was small thought this was a great present. The case has compartments for storing the rocks.
5425,Bachmann Trains Thomas with Annie and Clarabel Ready-to-Run HO Scale Train Set,0/0,1.0,"We received this product in a very timely fashion from Amazon, however, Thomas didn't work when we received it. We sent it to the manufacturer to be fixed and it's been there for weeks without hearing a word from anyone. We definately want our money back. My 9 year old son is very upset that Thomas and now his Percy both don't work!"
5426,Rope Ball Dog Toy,0/0,1.0,"I am always looking for a good quality rope toy. On this one, the rope came out the first time we used it."
5427,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,0/1,3.0,This fountain works well
5428,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,4.0,"This is a tea tastes really good (I only add a little sugar to it). I started taking it to help get ready to produce milk (I want to nurse my son when he arrives). For now I can't tell you if it's helped with that since I'm still waiting for him to arrive. However, even if you aren't expecting, it's still good for you and has a nice mild berry taste, not overpowering. I do wish the bags had tags on them so they were easier to &#34;fish out&#34; of the mug, but I've found many of my favorite teas don't have those handy tags on them."
5429,Scat Mat Electronic Pet Training Mat,1/1,5.0,"One of our cats had recently taken to using an entrance rug as a litter box. After reading several reviews, I bought it and placed that scatmat over the rug and waited. A couple of days later the cat approached the mat, stepped on it. The shock made her jump and she scurried away from it as fast as she could. She did come back to smell it once in a while but that's about as close as she gets. She no longer steps on the rug -- problem solved."
5430,Rainbow Light Advanced Enzyme System,1/1,5.0,"I finally found the right enzymes. For the last couple of years, I've had problems with reflux when stressed, eat late, eat wrong foods, etc, etc. It's been difficult, and costly to find the right brand, but these enzymes seem to really help. I only take one capsule, so it's even a better deal. It's such an individual thing, but these may work for you."
5431,Yamamotoyama - Tokusen Kokyu Sencha (Premium Green Tea) 3.5 Oz.,1/1,5.0,"when i say delicate I also mean the leaves. i felt they were very easy to burn considering my water wasn't even boiling! however, somehow my very first pot came out perfectly and i was amazed by the delicious flavor and perfect bright green color."
5432,"Creative Nail Design Creative Nail Solar Oil, 0.5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,Here's what I love about solaroil
5433,"4 pc. 5-6"" Stuffed Shin Bone Peanut Butter Flavor",0/0,3.0,"I bought this because I have 4 dogs to give to at Christmas. They love the bones, so that's good, but two are as shown in the picture, and two were placed next to each other in such a way that they were the size of the two larger ones. In other words, two were large and two were skinny. At first, I thought they'd sent only 3, but then when i opened the package I found the two small ones. Disappointing for the price. I buy the large ones at Petsmart but wouldn't have gotten my dogs the small ones if I'd known."
5434,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,My children loved this toy. A nice get away from electronic games like ps3 etc. An excellent choice for something different.

5436,Doll Stroller,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter. It was easy to assemble and a hit from the start. We love the realistic look and the fact that it has the straps to strap the &#34;baby&#34; in. I've only gotten positive feed back from her parents - no malfunctions.
5437,"Earthbath All Natural Shampoo, 16-Ounce",0/0,4.0,My dog seems to like it and doesn't itch as often. It smells great when applying but not much of a smell stays with the dog

5440,Mary Kay Timewise Age Fighting Moisturizer Normal/Dry,0/0,5.0,[...] Mary Kay backs their products with a 100% money back guarantee. I would not trust buying on amazon. It's not custom skin care and no guessing whats in the mary kay bottles.
5441,Bain-De-Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Serum (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"My hair is very straight, thick, but very fine. Other products have weighed it down so even with a shine it lacked body. You only use a drop of Bain de Terre Recovery Complex and your hair will shine."
5442,Caesars Man Cologne for Men by Caesars Palace,0/0,1.0,"I like to geve to this cologne a fat zero, Its not the real thik, you cane tell from the price of it ,its beter you buy colrox its chepper and it works.DONT BUY IT."
5443,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Up And Away Expansion Pack,0/0,4.0,"As with all Thomas products, you pay more and after awhile, you know what toexpect. Then, along comes a Thomas product that you know you are chargedbeyond reason, but you do it anyway. In this case, we knew it was over-priced, butwhat we didn't realize, was how little you really were getting for your money.My grandson loves it (soon to be five), but even he said when he opened the box,&#34;Is this it?&#34; At least we didn't pay what some retailers charge for it; Amazon was theleast expensive and being a 'prime' member, we didn't have to pay for shipping."
5444,Melissa & Doug Cheerleader Puppet,0/0,4.0,"This puppet is really cute. We have had alot if fun with it. The only ""complaint"" I have is that her left hand is attached to a stick. An adult can manipulate her mouth and the stick hand, but a child has a really hard time."
5445,Solid Wood Jumbling Tower In A Tin,0/0,5.0,Learn and play at the same time. My class would fight over who got to play with it. So I got five. Now we can all play together.
5446,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"These are adequately absorbent, no offensive scents from the diaper material (before being used). Easy to use restickable tape. I have used these diapers in varying sizes since day one without any problems (except that they cannot handle all the urine of a 2 year old overnight). I never had rash problems that I can attribute to these diapers."
5447,Set,0/0,5.0,"My 6 yr old loves to play this alone and with the family. It's a great travel game and never boring. Granparents are usually interesting in playing too which is nice. I'm quite tired of Candy Land and the like. This game and Castle Logix are great mind-muscle games that interest me instead of bore me to pieces! Portable, interesting, and easy to learn."
5448,Sequence Game,0/0,5.0,"Ive bought this ge as gifts for a few people and we've all gotten hooked in it. It requires strategy, thought and some luck."
5449,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,5.0,I was afraid that this process would be time-consuming and complicated but it is easy to do quickly and is especially helpful for small mouths with tight spaces between teeth!
5450,Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 16 beans JR Mushrooms brand,0/0,5.0,And my vanilla sugar is coming along as well. I was surprised by the quality and will continue to use JR Mushrooms and Specialties as my supplier for this ingredient.
5451,"Heath Outdoor Products DD-21 Multi Grain Suet Cake, Case of 16",0/1,3.0,"This stuff is OK. On the plus side, it lasts forever outside because the birds only eat it when they have no other options. But they like my homemade suet cakes way better. You put the homemade out there with the store-bought and it's no contest - they flock to the homemade but leave the store-bought for when they're really desperate. So, I guess I'll use it up, but not sure if I'll ever reorder - unless I get sick of making the homemade stuff."
5452,HALO Big Kids SleepSack Wearable Blanket Micro Fleece,0/0,5.0,"This sleep sack has been wonderful! It's super soft and snugly, my daughter loves it. I've been using Sleep Sacks since she was a baby because then I don't worry about her at night, if blankets are in her face, or if her blankets have fallen off. It was so great, I even bought a second. The 2T/3T fits her well and she is 2 1/2."
5453,Pacific Play Tents I See U 6' Tunnel,1/1,5.0,"This was a terrific buy!! My children (almost 2 yrs. old, 6 yrs. old, & 9 yrs. old) absolutely love it! I was thrilled at the quality too! It's very durable not like many collapsible tunnels & toys I've seen (& purchased). This one feels more heavy duty to me, & yet it's not rough or itchy either. That makes a BIG difference when kids are crawling through it! ;) Since Christmas my kids have enjoyed many hours of playtime with this tunnel. That makes this Momma very happy!!!"
5454,Activa Mens Dress Socks Moderate Compression 20-30 mmHg,0/0,3.0,"I am in sales, and im on my feet all day, thought these might help, nope! but they keep my legs warm."
5455,Webkinz Tree Frog,0/0,5.0,The hands on this adorable toy are great. My two year old likes to give high fives and this is a great new friend who can reciprocate. The body is nice and squishy for cuddling but the eyes are big and hard so watch out if your kid likes to throw toys!
5456,Tweezerman Stainless Steel Squeeze and Snip,0/0,5.0,Quality product! Smooth stainless steel. I know I will get years and years of use our of this product. There aren't too many brands that can stand up to &#34;Tweezerman&#34; just my opinion.
5457,Bigelow Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,This is a great product at a great price! We love this tea and can't find it in our local stores! Thank you for making it so easy and quick to get it!
5458,Specialist Line Doctor Bags - Leather,0/0,5.0,"This was a much, much smaller version of the custom bag my husband had made for me when I was a Lay-Midwife. The first burned in our Feb 2012 housefire. I did not really want to replace it since I am now a Registered Nurse but insurance mandated replacement. When I received it, I LOVED the quality and the new leather smell BUT I could not get it opened. I sent a message to the company and they were kind enough to send me back instructions. Meanwhile my brother and husband figured it out. So, I have a lovely, compact version that I will stock with the things I use now for trips or when someone asks me to come check on a friend or family memeber. Thank you to Physician-Bags and, of course, Amazon."
5459,PCA 18 Clearskin-1.7 oz,0/0,5.0,"I found this to be an excellent moisturizer/balancing cream for my oily, acne-prone skin. I only stopped using it because I could no longer afford this line, but I do recommend this highly.."
5460,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Rock-a-Stack,0/0,1.0,"This classic toy is overpriced here. You can get it at any dept. store.Also this toy is not the best. I have more trouble locating all the rings,that the baby throws them around everywhere. Not the greatest toy."
5461,ApHogee Two Step Protein Treatment,0/0,5.0,"Ok, so I've been using this stuff for three weeks now, (I'm african american & wash my hair weekly) & I've really noticed a difference.I've had years of coloring & relaxing my hair, so I've had dry hair, split ends, & constant breakage. My hair never seemed to grow past shoulder length. Health & hair care professionals say you're supposed to shed like 100 hairs a day, but I'm noticing that my hair sheds far less than that, if it sheds at all.After the first usage, my hair felt stronger. I usually air dry my hair & then flat iron it. Usually, when the flat iron neared my split ends, hair would start to break. Now, my hair feels stronger & like it doesn't &#34;give&#34; as easily.You have to follow the instructions when using this product and I'd recommend applying it in the shower, to keep the mess to a minimum. If you fully coat your hair, the product will run, so you're going to want to wrap your neck in a towel. Try to wrap your hair or have it up, without something holding it up. You could sit for 40 min & let this stuff air dry, but when using this product, I just blow dry my hair on a medium setting. As your hair begins to dry, it will still look wet, but it will become very hard. Be careful not to agitate your hair or try to comb through it, or you'll risk breakage. After your hair is dry, simply hop back in the shower, gently wash the treatment out & apply a deep conditioner -- then you're done!"
5462,John Deere - Tot Tractor,0/0,5.0,"Our 2yr. old twins are having a blast on them! Some of the reviews I read said that the stickers come off easy. They do, but I just glued them on and so far they are staying on just fine. This was a great purchase!"

5464,Dr. Noy's Sitting Frog Plush Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"This was the first stuffed animal we bought for our dog. We weren't sure if she would be really destructive with toys. She has managed to not damage this too bad except for some slobbery fur. She seems to love it. Easy for her to carry around. I ended up buying one for my sister as well, her dog managed to pull out the stuffing in the head rather quickly so if your dog is known to be good at that, they still might manage it with this one. The body has no stuffing though so it is still something they could carry around I suppose."
5465,Radio Flyer Radio Flyer Classic Red 12 Inch Cruiser? Red,0/0,5.0,What else can you say about Radio Flyer? Consistent quality as usual. Love the adjustable features that grow as the child grows.
5466,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,"The best dog collar! I have a rhodesian ridgeback that pulls a ton on walks making it almost impossible to walk her. With this gentle leader it immediately calms her down and she no longer pulls. Before I bought it I was unsure how this could work but it is amazing how calm it makes her.I also use it when people come over, sometimes she gets very excited and we can put the gentle leader on her and she immediately calms down. Works Great"
5467,HellRaiser Series 1 Pinhead,0/0,4.0,"I wouldn't recommend this as a toy but more as something to put on display. theres very small parts included and if played with, they can be broken off (his belt of knives). Looks great on our shelf."
5468,Crayola Model Magic Deluxe Variety Pack,0/0,5.0,loved the quality of the dough. made a flower out of it and it shipped earlier than the original date. it isn't messy and had a low scentit was worth the cost and crayola has once again done its best

5471,"Aurora Plush 12"" Cole Flopsie",0/0,4.0,"I bought this for one of my granddaughters and it's OK, but she didn't particularly like it. I think it's better to buy these plush animals in person, so we can see their expressions before purchasing."
5472,AeroGarden Classic 7-Pod with Gourmet Herb Seed Kit,0/0,4.0,I would have given it 5 starts but one of my seed packs was a dud. Also it would be nice if you could choose which herbs you wanted in your pack. 3 types of basil?
5473,Cafe Britt Dark Chocolate Covered Gourmet Macadamia Nuts,0/0,5.0,I had some of this while on a mission trip in Costa Rica and they were so good that when I saw them on Amazon I had to order them for my family to taste. They actually came packed in a cold retaining package with a cold pack inside to keep them from melting in the mail. I would recommend this to anyone that likes chocolate covered nuts. You won't find any better anywhere! .
5474,BIOTONE Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion (8 oz w/ Pump),1/1,5.0,"I researched and purchased this lotion about 8 months ago to take along to my chiropractor and massage therapist treatments; both continue to comment on how much they like working with my lotion. I love this stuff - it doesn't smell (I have one of the most sensitive sniffers on the planet), it lasts well during a 60-minute massage, and when used as a moisturizing lotion it absorbs easily. It is also non-staining. My chiropractor got some on my slacks once and it washed-out completely. I see a few massagers complain that they need to use too much, but that hasn't been an issue for me whatsoever. I've had five months worth of weekly visits to chiropractor and/or massage therapist and still have more than an ounce left in my 8-oz bottle. I'm ordering the gallon now, so I can moisturize and still have plenty left for therapy appointments!"
5475,Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,0/0,5.0,"great product! i can see my daughter clearly. i have another mirror and its also good, however i get to only see her face. but wit the diono, i get to see everything. nice and sturdy also!"

5479,Baby Buddy Baby's 1st Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,"I use this with my baby during her bath. The first time she wasn't sure, but now she loves it. When she sees it, she opens her mouth and then just gnaws on it. We use it for about a minute and it's great. She only has four teeth, but she thinks it's fun and it does the trick."
5480,LEGO MINDSTORMS Touch Sensor (9843),0/0,3.0,Pretty tiny piece for the price but guess that's Lego's . It was for someone special so guess it was worth it. :)
5481,Jetfire Twin Pack,0/0,5.0,"I am 7 years old. The only thing unrealistic about this plane is that the pilot is not hooked up to an oxygen mask. It's still a great flier though.

It was a good change of pace.The chocolate crunch was good and chocolatey. I don't always have time for lunch and they filled in very well with a high protein &#34;desert&#34; instead of normal food.I like all of the non-sugar think thin products that I have tried.

5488,Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,0/0,4.0,"It is very loud, the attachments are also hard to take off. Other then that it works good for the price."
5489,Tolo Toys Roller Ball Run,0/0,5.0,"My 9 mos. old grandaughter just had her 1st Christmas ! She rec'd more-than-enough toys from family & friends BUT she loves the Tolo toys the best. This one seems sturdily-made and is 'fun' even for the grown-ups ------ that is, if you can get the baby to 'share' !"
5490,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I just got these for christmas, ive been a hair stylist for about 7 years and these are hands down the best trimmers ive ever owned. I previously was using the Wahl peanut trimmers. The T-outliners are a little heavier so it took me a little while getting used to, but these get so close to the skin without kicking/cutting anyone. I would go as far to say that they get almost as close as a shaving razor. im in love with these and Andis has me as a customer from now on."
5491,Upside-Down Overpass Set,0/0,4.0,We have not had the pulling up issue others posted about. My girls 4 and 5 love it! My daughter who is 4 years old asked Santa for a race track. After reading the reviews I figured we just bold it to a piece of plywood. But we haven't had to. She loves it.We bought one of the extra cars. It does not make it around the track. Only the car that came with it does. There are ultra speed cars and we are going to get one of those. Hopefully it was do the track.

5493,"Crabtree & Evelyn 2792 Gardeners Hand Therapy (100g, 3.5 oz)",0/0,4.0,"I bought this based on other reviews. It smells great and feels great. I out it in every night before bedtime. However, my hands are dry when i wake up. Will not buy again, but works well enough to finish the tube. Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?"
5494,Summit Talking Cash Register (Pink),0/0,1.0,"I bought this register at the end of October for my daughter for Christmas. Christmas morning she was so excited to play with it. After opening it up we noticed the register drawer was broken, clasp had broken off, so it doesn't close. I called Amazon the following day to hopefully get a replacement but that couldn't be done so they gave me a refund for the full amount. This money i would then use to purchase same item, but now these registers are at least double the price. Then hours later I received an email from the actual vendor, Corydor, that they were going to charge me a restocking fee of $7 - it was broken, you can't restock and resell it! So frustrating! So now I'm stuck with a broken cash register because how do you explain to your child you have to return Santa's present. Awesome, thanks Amazon & Corydor."
5495,"Eden Organic Pumpkin Seeds, Dry Roasted, 4-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 15)",0/0,5.0,"These are a great healthy snack. I like the ability to purchase the larger quantities with the smaller packaging, so the product stays fresher longer."

5497,PCA SKIN - pHaze 4 Gentle Exfoliant (7 oz),0/0,2.0,"I have oily, acne-prone skin and found this product to sort of leave a film on my face. It did nothing to clear my skin, but it might be good for someone who wants a bit of exfoliation and has sensitive skin.."

5504,Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ion Turbo Vent Boar Round,0/0,4.0,"I have thick, wavy, unruly hair and this is one of the best brushes I have used. This speeds up my blow dry immensely and would be perfect for anyone wanting to improve their hair routine. My only con is the handle is smooth rubber material so your hands have to be free of product otherwise it becomes rather slippery. But once you realise that, the brush is flawless."
5505,Duro-Med Therabeads King Size 12 x 16 Moist Heat Pack with Cover,0/0,5.0,"This is perfect for hip, tummy, or back. It covers a wide area. It does have some weight to it, so take that into consideration. The moist heat is wonderful!"
5506,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,My eighth grader used something similar in grade 7 science. I purchased it for my fifth grader who can easily stay busy and learn to figure out how electricity works.
5507,"Supersmile Professional Whitening System, Small or Large",2/2,5.0,"This is a great product, I can definately see that my teeth are whiter! After using for a week or so, my teeth whitened from a slighly beigh-y yellow to pretty darn white. I have not noticed any tooth sensitivity, as I got with some over-the-counter whitening toothpastes. I can tell that it works because if I stop using it, my teeth get less white and I have to reorder! I think that the price is fair for a good quality product that works."
5508,Marshmallow Fun Co Marshmallow Blaster - Classic,0/0,5.0,"These were bought as props, and turned out to be the life of the party. If itis for small kids, just be Prepared to clean up all the marshmellows!"
5509,Wellgate for Women Slimfit Wrist Support,0/0,5.0,I love the slimmer fit of these wrist supports. I had to purchase both left and right. I had carpel tunnel surgery and the surgeon stated these were sturdy enough to wear after the surgery. The previous pair I had where longer and had metal going through the palm sides which was fine for night but not for day. These are perfect for both. I only wish they came in more colors but this is a great neutral color.
5510,Twinlab Maxilife CoQ10 Formula,0/0,5.0,"If I miss a day, it becomes obvious by late afternoon. So now I rarely miss taking and have recommended to family and friends.It contains much more than just the CoQ10 we need.

5514,"Quercetti Super Marble Run Vortis, 224 Pieces",0/0,2.0,"I am not very impressed by this marble run. For one, it's not very sturdy, and two, the marbles fly off the track in several places and get stuck in others. I would recommend you look elsewhere for a marble run, just my opinion."
5515,Mitsouko Perfume by Guerlain for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"Mitsouko has stood the test of time. Still fragrant, elegant, sweet-smelling. The love of my life loved it. I'm glad I made this purchase."
5516,Flinch,0/1,5.0,I grew up playing Flinch with my family and friends. The more players the better the game is. I've taken my Flinch game with me and introduced the game to my family. I bought the new Flinch for my children to continue having a family game to enjoy and play. A simple game that is pure enjoyment to play. Watch out or I will Flinch you!

5518,Plus White 5 Minute Speed Whitening Gel Formulated for Sensitive Teeth -- 3 oz.,0/0,5.0,This stuff works great. When I first got it I didn't have the plastic mouth retainers so I painted it on with a Q-tip. It helped renew the whiteness to my teeth in no time. I noticed a difference right away and have kept using it ever since. The tube is a great size too! I would definitely be re-ordering this when mine runs out.
5519,Small World Express Dashboard Adventures,0/0,4.0,"It's a busy, fun little toy. Once the novelty wears off, a curious child may not be that interested in it any longer."

5524,Burberry Weekend Cologne by Burberry for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,The best of perfumes so far. with it am more than confident in all my activities and duties. Am incomplete without it.
5525,BaByliss Pro Ceramic Tools Dual Voltage Professional Ceramic Spring Curling Iron,0/0,2.0,Ordered for my wife for xmas. She likes it but it is not CHI so be mindful of that. Had it gift wrapped when sent so I had no idea it was not what says until she opened it lol.
5526,Hot Couture,0/0,5.0,This is her favorite perfume so I knew it would be the right thing. Good for a twenty-something young woman.
5527,WaterPik WP-60W Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,"This works perfectly on a number of levels. Bought it for nasal irrigation for myself and water pic for my son. You have to purchase the Sinupulse Elite Replacement Sinus Irrigator Tip to use with it, but this is much more cost effective than purchasing more expensive models and just getting one use! I'm convinced that this saved me from the annual sinus infection I get every autumn. I just remove the tip and rinse the reservoir and then my son, who has braces, can use it for himself. It makes both of our lives much easier."
5528,Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid,0/0,5.0,"I have been using this for years. I did not realize that what is now out on the market is extracts and some have very little stevia in them. Especially the ones you now see advertised on tv that come in a box with packets. I did some research and found this out. I even returned a big box back to Costco when I learned it is just an extract and some other junk in it. It is hard to find this particular liquid item in stores any more, so I was happy to see it on line. And at this price for this amount of stevia, it is a great deal."
5529,Herbal Ear Cones (2-pack) 12inch cone by King Cone,0/0,5.0,"These cones are the most effective of any ear candling. However, always have someone else who is sensibly trained in doing the candling on you. Let's be smart to keep these products available to those of us who prefer natural non-invasive health techniques. Thank you."
5530,Ideal Pet Products 6.25-by-6.25-Inch Lockable Cat Flap with Telescoping Frame,0/0,5.0,"Recently installed one of these in our laundry room door so the cats can get to their food, water, and litter box. Took about 20 minutes to install. After laying out the template, I used a drill to create pilot holes in the corners. Then I used my jigsaw to cut between the pilot holes and to square out the corners. Then it was a simple matter of screwing the two halves together. Installation looks good, and the door is very simple to use. I highly recommend this product."
5531,Extra Virgin Coconut Oil by Garden of Life 16 fl. oz.,0/0,5.0,"I'm a huge fan. It's mild tasting, affordable and comes in a glass container. Most coconut oils come in a plastic container."
5532,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,"This stuff is wonderful! I can wash my clothes with it, my dishes and even brush my teeth with it. Everything but wash my hair.After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo but no matter what I tried it came out horrific. I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read but that was a major &#34;FAIL&#34;. I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty. So needless to say, 18-in-1 magic soap is a 17-in-1 since I can wash anything but my hair with it. I'm set on this soap for life. I love the peppermint tingle too."
5533,Phyto Phytophanere Dietary Supplement for Hair Nails and Skin,1/1,5.0,I had to have chemotherapy in the past and it took out the majority of my hair.... I was devastated. Someone told me about this product and I figured I had nothing to loose since my hair was already gone. I bought this product after I had finished my chemo and within a months time my hair was growing back thick and strong. I would reccomend this product to anyone if they are having problems with there hair falling out or thinning.
5534,Short Toilet Paper Aid,1/1,4.0,"On the occasions when my back goes out and stiffens up, my reach isn't adequate for proper wiping. At those times I'm relieved that I bought the short aid as it gives just enough extension for its purpose."
5535,50 x AG13/LR44/A76 Alkaline button cell battery,0/0,5.0,"Great value! I got 50 batteries that last for a long time (first two still haven't died yet!). They are in packages of 10 and are individually packaged in their own little compartments. I bought these for an old SLR camera and they work great! For $3, you might as well skip the brand names and get 50 of these suckers!"
5536,Carson SureGrip 2x Soft-Grip Glass Magnifier with 10x Spot Lens (SG-10),1/1,4.0,Delivery and item as described. Will go with higher than 2x for next purchase. Spot lens is difficult to see through so will not benefit from it.
5537,LUXOR Professional 7 1/2 inch Ice Tempered Barber Styling Shears (Model,1/1,4.0,"Good clean scissors, work well , seem well made. Im happy so far, just hoping they last a while its hard to find long scissors atm"
5538,"Nile Spice Potato Leek Soup, 1.0-Ounce Cups (Pack of 12)",0/0,2.0,"I enjoyed the classic-tasting split pea soup by Nile Spice, so was looking forward to their potato leek. Though I read the reviews and there was some mention of it being subpar (to put it nicely), I hoped that my tastebuds would find this good enough in times of laziness or hurry. I'm adventurous and quite the opposite of picky when it comes to foods so I thought, ""how bad could this really be?"" Well, I'll just say this"
5539,Hi Ho Cherry-O,0/0,5.0,"We bought this for our five year old son and he has enjoyed playing it with us and his three year old sister. It is a simple game that is quick to learn. The fruit are small, so easy to lose, but so far, no problems. It also came with one extra fruit of each color (so four extra fruits total)."
5540,"Olio Verde Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2011 Harvest (Sicily, Italy)",0/0,5.0,"This is the perfect olive oil for all special recipes, salads, and just for dipping bread. It's made with love and care in Sicily."
5541,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,3/3,5.0,"I've been using Naturtint for years. I tried various shades over the years including Dark Blonde, Dark Golden Blonde, Light Brown, etc. They always turned out too dark---sometimes almost black--but I just lived with it since after about 2 weeks or so, it lightened enough that it was tolerable. My hair is naturally a light to med brown with some gray mixed with it. On Christmas day, I decided I needed to color my hair before I went anywhere, so I had bought this shade to try. I figured it's either do or die because it was the only thing on-hand and all the stores were closed. (You know that feeling, right?) So...I mixed it up and took my wide-tooth comb and combed some through the front to do the strand test. I then rinsed and dried it and was very pleased so I went for it. It's a nice honey brown on me and it leaves the hair in great condition, very shiny. It doesn't burn your scalp or have the strong smells the other hair colors have, although those are good to have if someone's prone to fainting, needs to be revived and there are no ammonia capsules available. Try just one box of Naturtint and you won't be sorry. I hightly recommend the Naturtint Shampoo and Conditioner, the companion products that go with the color."
5542,Bracelet Buddy,0/0,5.0,Great idea...and it works well. I have several bracelets that I could never fasten by myself. This allows me to do it by myself now with no problem. Love this thing.
5543,Scattergories Junior,0/0,5.0,"I am using this game in my classroom to increase vocabulary. The regular version wasn't appropriate for elementary children, so I was thrilled to find the Junior version."
5544,"Old Mother Hubbard Crunchy Classic Snacks for Dogs, Large P-Nuttier",0/0,5.0,"My older dog (12) loves these treats! They are great for his teeth, and I don't have to worry about him gaining too much weight with them."
5545,Melissa & Doug Classic ABC Block Cart,0/0,3.0,"I opened this when I received it, but have not let my 17 month old nephew open it. The blocks are smaller than I thought they would be. He is still into throwing things and these seem like they could be dangerous at this stage. Going to give it a few months before I allow him to have this one."
5546,Dyna Magz Magnetic Construction Kit M1700,0/0,3.0,My boys plays with a more substantial kit at school. I thought this product would measure up to the same level. It didn't.
5547,"Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract, Plus Enzyme, Formula 102, 100 tablets",1/1,5.0,this is great. has no garlic smell and helps to keep yeast issues under control. I have noticed that since I have been taken this I have not been craving sweets as much.
5548,My ABC Animal Train Travel Bag By Pockets of Learning,0/0,5.0,I almost sent this back b/c it was so many pieces I thought I would never take this on a plane (which is why I bought it). I still would not take it on a plane but my 18 mos. daughter LOVES this toy. It is a lot of pieces to clean up but she has soooooo much fun with it. Well worth the price.
5549,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby's First Blocks,0/0,1.0,The top comes off so easy that my 12 month old refuses to sort the shapes but simply takes off the lid and put the pieces in the bucket.
5550,Corolle Mon Premier Calin Charming Pastel Baby Doll,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my daughter who is just under a year old, it is the perfect size and seems to be very durable!"
5551,Hasbro Operation,0/0,4.0,"My 6 year old received the Operation game for Christmas and at first, she became very frustrated with the tweezers because she could not pick up ANY piece without being buzzed. So we adjusted them just a tad (the tweezers are flimsy and easily bendable) and now they work like a charm! So much better than before. Is easier and allows more control for a childs unsteady hand, but still difficult enough to make the game challenging....even for adults. We have played this game non stop since we ""fixed"" the tweezer issue."
5552,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,I purchased this for my 7 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He is a busy guy who likes to figure out how things go together and work. As soon as he took this out he went right to work. He was able to follow the instruction booklet very easily and was able to make the fan spin and have the light bulb go on very quickly! He has played with it for several days (literally all day). He checks off the experiments he has done in the booklet and he has been able to come up with new experiments and new ways to make the light bulb go on. There are still so many experiments for him to do and I know he will enjoy this toy for some time. The nice thing is that there is not a zillion pieces to this so it's not overwhelming and so far the only thing he has needed not included in the kit was 2 AA batteries. Overall a fantastic toy that you will be happy your child is playing with!!! Worth more than the $29 I paid for sure!
5553,"Clorox Bleach Pen Gel, 2 oz (56 g)",0/0,4.0,It's pretty neat to watch the moldy lines of grout in my shower magically turn white over night. Worked exactly as I wanted it to.
5554,Purness Van Ness Cat Pan in Gray,0/0,5.0,"I have been having trouble finding a plastic pan that is deep enough for preschool children's indoor water, cornstarch, cornmeal, etc activities. This pan is the perfect size. We can fit about 6 of them on our preschool tables for an activity and they are deep enough that the material inside the pan does not immediately spill out on the table and floor. The blue color is nice, too. Highly recommended for the price!"
5555,Paco Rabanne for Men After Shaving Products,1/1,5.0,The product is very hard to find. I was glad to find it so I can give it to my husband as he loves the fragrance.
5556,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper Push Toy,0/0,4.0,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 23-month old niece this Christmas and she was THRILLED !!! Loved the noise and took the opportunity to frequently imitate it. The sound was less annoying to the adults than I'd anticipated. However, when we replayed videos we recorded of her play, the popping sounded like gunfire. I'd give the 5 stars except for the way Amazon packed it for shipping. It was delivered in an over-sized box without the original Fisher-Price wrapping. Made for challenging gift wrapping."
5557,Carex Bed Buddy,0/0,5.0,This body wrap is perfect for my mom who suffers with arthritis especially in her neck. The shape is just right!She uses it everyday and loves that the heat is exactly where she needs it.I will definitely recommend this product!
5558,"Balance Bar Nutrition Energy Bar, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)",1/1,5.0,"I have tried many protein bars (except for peanut flavors), and this is my favorite. It's better-tasting than most candybars, and none of the BalanceBars have spiked my blood pressure (not an energy bar; those they call their ""gold"" line). Also the nutritional ""balance"" is at least on par with others-- bear in mind this qualifies as a meal (by the numbers if not for real), not just a snack.CONS--It will melt in heat (as in shipping); there has been some batch-to-batch variation for whatever reason, maybe the shipping, but they're still tasty; and as with other of these fairly dense protein bars, I prefer eating them with fluids, for better digestion. If I'm going to grab one heading out the door, for a breakfast, better get a drink too, or just eat half. 16g of protein is a big breakfast."
5559,Multipet Nuts for Knots Ball Medium Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"My Poochy, a gigantic Golden Retriever, is a fan of playing catch. I think I bought already at least a dozen of balls of different kinds and texture but nothing that stuck. They would all get torn to pieces. This one wasnt different, eventually she tore it up but it was well worth the price for how much she used it."
5560,Traditional Medicinals Teas Mother's Milk Tea,1/1,5.0,My wife was having production problems and the lactation consultant we saw suggested a fenugreek extract. That worked but was ridiculously expensive so we bought this based on the good reviews and it works just as well. Our son gets gassy and spits up but it doesn't seem like an unusual amount. It's hard to compare to a reference value for him because my wife needed the fenugreek when he was about a week old. She's happy with it and we haven't noticed any ill side effects for her or our son.
5561,Camille Beckman Glycerine Hand Therapy,0/0,5.0,"I have been a fan of Camille Beckman for years. Great for winter dry skin, over exposed summer skin, and softens those pesky calluses on feet, knees, and elbows. My sister's favorite fragrance (I prefer Vanilla). Give it a try, you'll love it!"
5562,Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,0/0,3.0,"I thought it was the greatest in comparison to the other types, until it snagged on wire grass. You pull and if it breaks the weeds it might just send the poop flying towards your face. NOT cool!"
5563,"Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces",0/0,3.0,this product came just like described. i was very satisfied with the speed which i received this item. i recommend this to anyone.
5564,LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166),0/0,5.0,Loved the item for christmas. Item arrived on time and the child love it. I will be shopping here in the future.
5565,OTC ORTHOTEX Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Hinged Bars,0/0,4.0,"The brace fit my leg which was surprising. However, after wearing for a short time it would start to slide but that is to be expected since my thigh is larger than my calf. At the end of the day the straps would start to cut into the back of my knee which was quite uncomfortable. To resolve this issue I started wearing the brace outside my pants (since it is winter). I have seen improvements in my knee since I have started using it. I don't have the pain and swelling that I had been having before hand. I will continue to use the brace when I exercise in the near future. I love the fact that I can bend my knee enough when using it that I can use it in yoga class (it allows me to kneel completely in the floor). I would recommend it to other fat people who can't fit anything else being that nothing else would fit for me to compare it to."
5566,Wellgate for Women Slimfit Wrist Support,0/0,5.0,I got pretty bad carpal tunnel while pregnant but still needed to type all day for work. This was a lifesaver!
5567,Over Bed Table,0/0,5.0,"Great product!! Easy to assemble. Rolls easy on carpet, table space is big enough for all of my moms items. Would recommend this product highly!"
5568,Kent OE1 Hair Brush,0/0,5.0,"This is a high quality brush. Correction. It is a very high quality brush.As soon as I got it out of the box, it was clear that this was in a class by itself.A quick brushing each night results in a more attractive head of hair.So please that I gave a Kent brush to my son for Xmas."
5569,Undergravel Filter - 125/150/180/220XH - 72 in. x 18 in.,0/0,5.0,This undergravel filter is very well made with nice heavy plastic that will not crack due to heavy gravel or rocks in the aquarium.
5570,Safety 1st Lock Release Fridge Latch,0/0,1.0,This product worked great for 48 hours. Then the latch stopped closing. I tried repeatedly to get it working again to no avail. Difficult to remove from your fridge after.
5571,"Yogi Cold Season, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I get a chest cold every winter which settles in my lungs and causes me to cough for months without relief. My doctor says it is normal and there is little I can do to prevent it. Well, Yogi Cold Season tea helps a lot! I have been drinking a cup a day of this outstanding tea since Thanksgiving and so far, knock on wood, I have not had my usual chest congestion. Other reviewers testify to this fact - it works. If you get chest congestion, give it a try. By the way, ignore those who say the taste is awful. Not true. No, it is not delicious, but it certainly is acceptable."
5572,"Clean & Clear Morning Glow Moisturizer, SPF-15, 4-Ounce Pump Bottle",0/0,4.0,"This cream is really good at moisturizing and works generally well as a day-to-day sunscreen. Would need something stronger if you were outside all day or in a tropical area. My only concern is that if you look closely, it has little sparkles in it - that's what gives you the 'glow' it mentions - and I don't like the idea of covering my fresh-washed face in glitter."
5573,"PetSafe No-Bark Collar, PBC-102",0/0,5.0,I would wake to my dog barking In the middle of the night. Bought this and his barking stopped. Best purchase
5574,Heel Inc Traumeel,0/0,3.0,"Received quickly, packaged well, all that, but it did not help my hip and leg. No effect. Some arthritis in hip. Went to chiropractor and found out my hips were out of alignment and I am now much better."
5575,Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 15 2.5 Fl Oz,0/0,4.0,"This product is an excellent source of texture refinement, sunscreen and moisture. I actually prefer a stronger SPF, so I use the regular Regenerist Regenerating Serum and add a stronger sunscreen."
5576,Magnetic Gyro Wheel by Schylling,0/0,4.0,"My son has sensory sensitivity issues and he loves this toy; he says it makes his hand feel better. I'm not sure exactly what that means for him, but he's left-handed and his hand probably gets cramped from learning to write, so maybe it eases tension there. He seems to also find it mesmerizing.As others have written, I too, had one of these when I was a kid, and I didn't care for it much (found it boring), but it was also quite indestructible and could not be put out of alignment. The metal rods in this one are very easy to bend, so they get out of alignment at the hands of most kids easily, and I have to realign them often. If they're slightly out of alignment the rolling of the wheel is uneven and unsatisfactory, and if it is very out of alignment, it won't work and the wheel falls off.For the the price you pay (under $5.00) you can't expect stellar quality, so take 5 minutes every now and then to realign it. It does work, and while fixing it, enjoy talking to your kid about this simple, non-electronic toy that you had as a kid ""back in the day"" and enjoy the opportunity to communicate with your kid instead of looking at your smartphone."
5577,Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Multi-Usage Dry Oil,0/1,3.0,"Although this is a nice oil with a very nice smell, baby oil does the same exact thing and cost a lotttt less than this product."
5578,Earlyears Surprise Inside Elephant,0/0,5.0,"An adorable baby gift... it was a hit at my niece's baby shower! Since the baby wasn't born yet, it's difficult to know if the baby will enjoy playing with it."

It would clean my shower walls really good, (have really irony water), looked every where for this, finally found it on Amazon, but it just don't work like it used to,, I wish they wouldn't change things. when you have a good product,, leave it alone,,"

5583,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas! He had used Nautica Voyage before and loved it. He ran out about a month before Christmas. I thought it would be the perfect gift. After looking in the stores at the cologne I found out that it was between $30 and $40 elsewhere! Amazon's price is so much lower than store pricing and is awesome! Would recommend to anyone! He loved it!
5584,Vitakraft Canary Egg Sticks and 1.90-Ounce Bag,1/1,3.0,"I gave these egg sticks to my cockatiel and canary, and neither liked them, particularly. I wouldn't order these again."

5586,Melissa & Doug Puzzle Storage Case Single Wire,0/0,4.0,"It doesn't fit the bigger puzzles, but I just have the standard puzzles anyway. I'm really glad I made the purchase."
5587,SmartCat Bootsie's Combination Scratcher,0/0,5.0,"You know what I hate about cat scratchers? They are UGLY! Who wants an obnoxious carpet wrapped pole hanging out in their living area? That is why I nearly swooned when I saw SmartCat's offering on Amazon. After living with this scratcher for 4 months, I can tell you it is as beautiful as I hoped (well, as beautiful as a scratching post can be) and our cat uses it for 95% of her scratching needs (I don't think a lifetime of squirts from a water bottle will ever curb her love affair with our green armchair). After mounting it to the wall, this scratcher almost disappears from view. Happiness."
5588,"ADC ADSCOPE Sprague Scope, 22""",0/0,5.0,So much better then the silly junk that comes in children's Dr. kits. Kids love this. Investigating many household objects making sounds. Creative uses.
5589,Quantum Pad,0/0,5.0,"Our 8 year old loves the quantum pad she inherited from her sister, and the new cartridges and books have given her challenges and great pleasure. I got her the higher grades (4th and 5th grade) and am glad I did. The problems and games are great, not too easy, either. Good stuff."
5590,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,My 2 years old godson loves it. Keeps him busy playing while he is learning. The phone and all the activi are great!
5591,"Tazo Tea, 20 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",0/0,5.0,Found this tea at the hotels I stay at for job and loved it but could not find it in any of the Starbucks. Wife now likes it more than any other teas too.
5592,Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,0/0,5.0,"After reading the reviews, I decided to get this and am so glad I did! The mirror is nice and big and I can see my entire car seat and baby, it stays in place well, it was very easy to install, and so far seams great quality."
5593,"Pureness Cat Starter Kit, Assorted Colors",0/0,5.0,This set was and is perfect as I had nothing when i decided to get my kitten and it's worked wonders for her
5594,Flexi Leash Accessory Bag-Black,2/2,1.0,"I was hoping that this accessory bag would replace the separate poop bag dispenser dangling from my leash handle, but it's too big. The velcro straps can't be adjusted tight enough to make it fit my 23' Flexi Explore for small dogs, making it neither comfortable nor convenient to use. Also, the zipper compartments are larger than what I need for routine daily dog walks. This product might work if you use a large-dog leash and need to carry more gear."
5595,"Lee's Stretch Ultra Gravel Vacuum Cleaner, Self-Start",1/1,4.0,"Vary basic, but easy to use, and dose a decent job. I'v only used a few times but seems to get most of the nasty stuff. Rocks do get sucked up a bit, but give it a shake and they come right out. I like that is sucks out the water when I do a water change, just put the hose in the sick and walk away for about ten mins. I have no need or desire to get anything else, it dose what it's intended to do, with a little elbow grease."
5596,Little Colorado Kid's Play Table - Natural,4/4,1.0,"The product features says that this play table comes with two large capacity drawers. But it only mentions that these drawers are optional further down in the product description AND there is no way to indicate that you want that option.I ordered this item as a gift on December 9, in plenty of time for Christmas. The projected delivery date was between December 13 and 19th but it still didn't come until December 28, clearly too late to display with the legos and train set we got my son for Christmas.After the delivery was already late I tried to track it using the information listed on Amazon, which said it was shipped with UPS and gave a tracking number. After going in circles with UPS it turns out it was shipped by FedEx!Unfortunately my husband had already unpacked and assembled it before I recognized the drawers weren't included so I can't return it now.Ultimately, I feel duped since Amazon clearly leads people to believe that the drawers come with the table. Even after I realized this was a bait and switch, I noticed it wasn't even clear how you would purchase the drawer separately!I am a frequent Amazon consumer and I usually am very pleased with my purchases and their services, but this was a huge disappointment all-around. Had it been clear that this table did not include drawers, I could've made a different selection and maybe even received THAT one in time for Christmas!"
5597,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",0/0,5.0,We were worried when we ordered based on some of the reviews! This has saved our lives!! We have a 7 month old little girl and she sleeps so much better with this product. We bought this because you can turn the automatic shut-offoff!!
5598,"Aurora World 12"" Emperor Mama And Baby Penguin",0/0,5.0,It is well made and extremely plush. And it is very cute. What else can I say about a stuffed animal?
5599,HALO SleepSack Wearable Blanket - Cream Micro-Fleece,0/0,5.0,"My daughter and I both sleep better at night because of the sleep sack! She stays warm and cozy and I don't worry about her suffocating. I would say these are must haves for anyone with a little one! I've used them with both my daughters and highly recommend. They hold up well considering how often they need to be washed, no pull seams or fading. We have the fleece for cooler nights and the cotton for warmer nights."
5600,Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Hydro Gloves,2/2,1.0,"It's too rough and doesn't produce foam like other pairs of exfoliating shower gloves do. Additionally, the color shown is not the color I received. I reported this to the seller with no response. The color I got was a feminine sea-green."
5601,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Husky Plush,0/0,4.0,Great toy! Very life like and real looking plus very well made and seems to be fairly durable. My child loves it and the price was right.
5602,"Crown Prince Natural Flat Fillets of Anchovies in Pure Olive Oil, 1.5-Ounce Jars (Pack of 18)",0/1,5.0,"Marcella Hazan, the Julia Child of Italian cooks and cookbook writers, recommends buying anchovies that come in glass jars instead of cans. I do what I am told to."
5603,"Zotz Fizz Sour Candy - Cherry,Watermelon, Apple (case of 48)",0/0,5.0,"Zotz are delicious! I can't find them anywhere close by so instead of paying double at the gas station or having to go a party store, I figured I'd just get out fix on Amazon. Great deal - good price, lot of zotz. Should last us a while. If you like sour and/or fizz, this is the candy for you. However, I don't think they're sour."
5604,"Kinder Bueno, CASE, 43 g x 30 bars",0/0,5.0,This was delicious! I'd order it again. I love the way it is packaged; so easy to open. It arrived quickly and damage-free.
5605,Medline Deluxe 12 Inch Wheels Transport Lightweight Wheelchair - Great for Outdoors - Blue,1/1,5.0,"Bought this for our son that has trouble walking long distances! This is perfect for him, he's 14 and this has plenty of room! Received this in great condition and in plenty of time for Disneyland! Thank you so much!"
5606,Bee Premium Playing Cards (Colors may vary),0/0,5.0,They are good playing cards and they have the Bee patterns and designs but the cards seem a bit off when I hold them up to a deck that I've purchased locally. I wouldn't be surprised if they are counterfeit cards... that said they are really pretty good cards overall.
5607,"Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Sleeve for Hand, Wrist, Elbow, 5.5"" x 7""",0/0,5.0,"I've been plagued by chronic tendonitis that medications haven't helped, but this heated sleeve gave me relief for the the first time in ages. Wish I'd bought one for each elbow, but I can reheat and do one arm at a time. This one is small, though, so look for the proper size. I'm a size four and have to roll this up my arm as it is so snug, perfect for me but if you have more meat on your bones be sure to get the right size."
5608,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,0/0,5.0,Comfortable material inside and out. Great design and it's just all and all a high quality product. It would be even better if it has more color selection.
5609,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,0/0,5.0,I really love this blood pressure monitor. The cuff is easy to adjust and the readings are accurate. I would recommend it to a friend or family member.

My hands get dry and irritated too from winter and frequent hand washing. This product is great for me too. Thanks amazon. Priced better than local stores."
5611,Guardian Cotton Web Training Pet Lead Leash - Black,0/0,5.0,"I prefer cotton because it's more comfortable for my hand (I've been seriously rope-burned by a nylon lead). This one is as good as any and a decent price. If you have a very large or strong dog, however, the snap may not be sturdy enough since a dog moving fast at the end of a long lead has a lot of leverage."
5612,Small World Living Toys My-Oh-My Pizza Pie,0/0,5.0,All I can say is '&#34;EXCELLENT&#34;'!! Opened at Christmas and the granddaughters and the parents enjoyed them. Will get a lot of fun with this in their little kitchens. That is Velcro on the side of each piece to hold them together. Really a cool pizza!

5614,Crayola Blunt Tip Scissors (Colors May Vary),0/0,5.0,Glad to purchase it. Its safe and best for kids and feels good for parents. I highly recommend this item.
5615,"Balance Bar Nutrition Energy Bar, 1.76-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)",1/1,5.0,"I have tried many protein bars (except for peanut flavors), and this is my favorite. It's better-tasting than most candybars, and none of the BalanceBars have spiked my blood pressure (not an energy bar; those they call their ""gold"" line). Also the nutritional ""balance"" is at least on par with others-- bear in mind this qualifies as a meal (by the numbers if not for real), not just a snack.CONS--It will melt in heat (as in shipping); there has been some batch-to-batch variation for whatever reason, maybe the shipping, but they're still tasty; and as with other of these fairly dense protein bars, I prefer eating them with fluids, for better digestion. If I'm going to grab one heading out the door, for a breakfast, better get a drink too, or just eat half. 16g of protein is a big breakfast."
5616,Rainbow Light Women's One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,I love this brand it doesn't upset my stomach and I can tell a difference when I take them regularly
5617,Candice Michelle Action Figure,0/0,5.0,"We are completely satisfied, we have no complaints. The action figure is exactly as described, and we are very pleased with our purchase."
5618,Alex Toys Rub a Dub Squirters for the Tub On the Go Transportation,0/0,5.0,Be sure to check the dimensions! These are fairly small bath squirties that come in a cute little zip up carry case. We use them nightly in the tub and they've done great.
5619,Energizer-Eveready 00916 NH22NBP Rechargeable Battery,0/2,5.0,I use these batteries in my TENS unit and need to change batteries often. This is stupid that I need 6 more words.

5621,"POOF-Slinky 0SA508 Scientific Explorer My First Chemistry Kit, 14-Activities",0/0,2.0,"I bought this and a couple of other science sets for my 5 year old grandson after much comparing. The set shown here says on the cover that it is for &#34;4 years&#34; old. When the set arrived, the box said &#34;8 years&#34; with no explanation for the change. Otherwise, it's the same set with the rest of the box the same and the same contents.The change worried me, though I did end up giving it to my grandson. His mother will have to help him anyway and my fingers are crossed hoping there is no danger for a 5 year old."
5622,O-27 Track Pack #1,0/0,5.0,Order arrived on time. Nice product for Old Lionel Train Ready Sets. I used to expand O train Oval track to form an 8 track. It works fine.
5623,Alba Botanica Hawaiian Sugar Cane Body Polish,1/1,5.0,I love using scrubs after I shave my legs but the salt ones sting. I tried a lot of sugar scrubs and they didn't seem to work as well as the salt ones ... Till I found this! Smells sweet and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth all day!
5624,Mini Spectra Light Globe,0/0,1.0,Was hoping this would work for a plane trip i took with my toddler. Didn't work from the moment I opened the package.
5625,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Vehicles & Traffic Signs,0/0,4.0,the pieces are a little smaller then I thought they would be but the colors and design are good. They will go well with the trains etc.
5626,Stork Craft Hoop Glider & Ottoman,1/1,5.0,"I'm waiting on the arrival of my little one but already absolutely love sitting in this glider. It is the perfect combination of softness but not too cushioned that you sink in and have trouble getting up and out of the chair. The little pockets on the arms of the glider look like they will be helpful for storing any items that need to be close by during feedings. I was expecting this to be one of the more difficult pieces of nursery furniture to assemble but it was actually the easiest! I started to take pieces out of the box while waiting for my husband to get his tools to put it together and by the time he returned I had the whole chair put together it took 15 minutes tops. Also, this is hands down one of the cheapest glider and ottoman sets available anywhere I've looked. This has been my favorite and easiest baby purchase!!"
5627,"Ethical 3-1/2-Inch Pet Food Can Covers, 3-Pack",0/0,4.0,Great product..just took me FOREVER to get the sticky lables off the inside of the lids! Will recommend them though!
5628,Escada Magnetism By Escada For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my husband thru Amazon. Very hard to find in brick and morter stores. I love this wonderful scent, rich with hints of spice and musk. Long lasting but not overpowering. And he loves it too."

I had Chamomile tea while my husband was around. I love the peppermint tea as well"
5634,"Mehaz Rubis Slanted Tweezer 3 3/4"" #130",0/0,3.0,"For years now I have only used the Rubis Tweezers & they have been the best. The gold slanted ones have plucked better & lasted longer, but I have not been able to find these. I am actually going to call/email the company, because I just got these & they are not working that well already, even just after a dozen tweezes. I may ask to see if the gold ones are available & I will send these back. In fact I will do that right after I finish this review."
5635,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,3.0,"This post looks nice and has good build quality. It took only a few minutes to put together.Unfortunately, my cats won't use it! This post is made of sisal, but my cats are used to sisal with a more rope-like quality. This sisal is woven, and for whatever reason they just refuse to use it to scratch. Just be aware that your cats may be like mine, especially if they're used to a post with a different texture. As it would have cost $20 to ship it back to Amazon, I donated the post to a local animal aid society."

5638,United Airlines Die-Cast Airport Play Set,0/0,3.0,"Good play set for the price, but the plane is not all die-cast. The topside of the fuselage may be die-cast, but the wings are plastic. My son already accidentally stepped on the plane and broke a rear wing. Also, the wheels are not that realistic. Besides the problems with the plane, my son likes the airport bus, the luggage van (that moves up and down), and the runway signs."

5642,Avon SKIN SO SOFT Original Moisturizing Shower Gel Original Lot of 2,0/0,5.0,"I was hoping this skin so soft shower gel would do the same as their other skin so soft in keeping the mosquitos away. It does! I was not sure after rinsing it off and toweling dry, but no worries it works great! Normally my husband says he knows the mosquitos bypass him and go for me so he knows if I am around he won't get bit. Not anymore, lol. I offered him a container of my gel but he turned me down, ( ah well all for me )Love not getting bit!!!!"
5643,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"*Don't* apply this nail polish without first applying a coat of white polish to the nail first. It makes the color seriously neon!

5644,Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion 2.2 Oz & Peel System Skin Care 2.0 Fl Oz,1/1,5.0,Great price on Amazon. I am in my early 30's and wanted to start a simple skin care line. This is a gentle product. It is the price that is why I have given it high rating. Oil of Olay is a lot more inexpensive on Amazon than Walmart or Target even with a coupon this past year.
5645,My Chemical Romance Action Figure Mikey Way,0/0,5.0,Perfect for any action figure collectors or My Chemical romance fans!I would recommend this! A little small but worth it/.
5646,Naturtint - Permanent Hair Colorant,0/0,1.0,"This product totally fried my hair. My hair is broken and damaged because of this product. I thought it would be better for my hair than the Clairol product I usually use, but it was a disaster."
5647,"Petrodex Dog Dental Care Kit, Toothpaste with 2 Toothbrushes",1/1,3.0,"This seems like a good idea but so far both my dog and I evidently need practice. Not as simple as it seems..dogs don't appreciate you having your finger in their mouths,(can't say I blame them..think dentist!). I will keep trying...She loves the toothpaste flavor though."
5648,Caraway Seeds 5 Pounds Bulk,0/0,5.0,"I use Caraway seeds to brew a tea ( two teaspoons per mug, let steep for 15 minutes) After having severe abdominal pains for 8 months... doctors were at a loss on how to help. I remembered this home remedy and WOW it worked. I had previously not given this merchant a 5 star rating but They now totally deserve it. It was packaged very securley and arrived in record time and it is an A-1 product...And this is a 5 star merchant !!!! You can buy with confidence !!!!"
5649,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 10-Piece Magnetic Bug Catching Game,0/0,5.0,"bought this for a 2 year old and he loves it. he has a train one just like it and found this one just as interesting, it kept him enthralled during his birthday party. great for hand eye coordination!"

5653,Schick Quattro Refill Cartridges,0/0,5.0,"Sitting at my kitchen table, I ran my hand across my face. Nothing feels better to me than aultra close shave. Thats what I get using Schick Quattro Titanium blades. This is a very goodproduct. I have not even looked back at the other brand that I used for a long time. There isno comparison to me. Those refills can cost you as much as four dollars a piece. I can shavefor a month using a Quattro refill and it costs me half as much as the other brand. I don'tshave every day, I don't have to. I generally shave about 3 times a week. Schick is now mybrand for life. I don't know how you can get a better shave....well maybe if Sophia Vergarawas shaving your face. :-) I digress....."
5654,Tweezerman Nose Hair Clipper,0/0,5.0,"There's not much to say here. It's simple, and it works perfectly. I've had other electronic or mechanical trimmers that were either noisy, or tickled, or vibration-stung my nose, or yanked the hairs out instead of cutting. This is definitely a case where simpler is better."
5655,Deluxe Pink Bent Graduate Glass Dildo,0/0,5.0,Why did I not buy a glass piece sooner? I might as well just throw away my other ones because this one is mine and Hubby's new best friend! Definitely a must have for your toy collection
5656,Redbarn Peanut Butter Filled Bone,0/0,2.0,I gave these bones to my dogs for Christmas. They thought they were just OK. One of my dogs is a Weim and he is big and loves to chew. He is not impressed with this bone. These bones are very hard and kind of heavy and a little messy. They might be too much for a smaller dog.

5659,"bareMinerals MATTE SPF 15 Foundation with Click, Lock, Go Sifter",0/0,3.0,"After watching commercials, was excited to try this makeup and brush. It's a total let down. I have pale skin so purchased the fair makeup & brush. Doesn't look like makeup. Goes on like light powder. Not at all what I was expecting. Thought there would be coverage especially for my freckles and age spots. It doesn't cover anything & just looks like you put powder on your face with no makeup. Not like the commercials advertise. Lastly, this product is small and not worth the price they charge for it. I would not recommend this product. Thumbs down for me."
5660,POOF-Slinky 228BL Disney Pixar Toy Story Slinky Dog Jr.,0/0,4.0,this is the greatest looking slink I have seen. My toddler likes to stuff things in the coils and it caused them to deform on the first day but I can't complain too much - I don't think the toy was designed for his age group.
5661,PetAg KMR 2nd Step Kitten Weaning Food 14oz,1/1,5.0,"My cat has had serious problems over the last few years with gum/dental problems, and lost quite a bit of weight in the process of diagnosing and treating him. After we got the infection cleared up, his appetite was still shaky due to his association of food with pain - he was even unable to eat canned food without screaming until we got his teeth removed and the infection cleared up. My vet recommended mixing a scoop of this in with his foods and a cup or so of water to entice his appetite. It amazingly worked like a charm. He's back up to his normal 13 lb self, his coat is glossy and soft again, and his eyes are bright. Even though he's 12, he's playing like a kitten again. I know that resolving the infection had quite a bit to do with that, but if we weren't able to get him eating again, it would still be a long battle ahead.Make sure to get your cat's teeth cleaned on a regular basis - I've had 2 so far that have had this same issue, and it's a nasty infection to get rid of :("
5662,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,Very nice blue color... very soothing on the eyes. Easy application. Great nail polish! As expected with Zoya. Thank you :)
5663,Redneck Life Board Game,0/0,5.0,"This game is so good, it'll knock yer' teeth out! Our son is a part-time Yooper college student. He and his friends could not stop laughing throughout the game. Great for family get togethers; especially, since my brother has a place in the Upper Peninsula."
5664,Unker's Medicated Salve,0/0,5.0,"I use this product all year. It has so many uses and can't be beat for winter colds and cold weather issues. I have used UNKER'S for many years and it has never let me down. In the past, I have purchased the small jars by the case and given it out to friends and family members."
5665,Key-E Suppositories with Natural Vitamin E,1/1,5.0,Was told about this product and was glad I found it would recommend it to other women and my family.Thanks for the great service
5666,BreathRx Tongue Scraper (3 Scrapers) from bulk,0/0,5.0,"I really like this product. I was given one of these by my dentist years ago, and I use it daily. I have looked at department stores and drug stores, but never found more to purchase. I was happy to find it here for a good price. I should have thought to check amazon sooner."
5667,"Panasonic LR-03GA/4B Digital Power AAA Alkaline Batteries, 4 Pack",0/0,3.0,These batteries have been used in various household applications and everything seems to be working strong even after a couple of months. Panasonic isn't a brand I use often but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did.
5668,ThinkFun Rush Hour Jr.,0/0,5.0,"We all enjoy this game, especially my kids, 7 and 9. I like the bag that comes with it to store the game which makes it easy to take in the car or on trips. For kids over 8 or 9 years I would buy the Rush Hour edition (non junior)."
5669,"Gillette Sensor3 Disposable Cartridge, 8 Count",0/0,5.0,Exactly as described. these 3 blade inserst are not available locally and it was good to get them off line. Good shipment as they arrived before schedule.
5670,ALEX Loop N Loom,0/0,4.0,My daughter loves looms. She has already made several pot holders and a little purse. Not sure how it works myself but apparently it is easy to use and great for kids!
5671,Jobst It Stays Roll-On Body Adhesive,0/0,5.0,"I have to wear surgical stocking because of vericose veins in both of my legs & knew of this product from when I was in the medical field. Can not recommend this product enough for those who must wear stockings & have problems with them staying up. I do a lot outdoors & walking with my dog & couldn't get thru any of it without this adhesive. Priced this product at several local medical supply stores & other sources & have found here at Amazon the best price. I ordered several at a time, which last a long time for me & save a bundle."
5672,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Folding Princess Castle,0/0,5.0,"Quality wooden castle that has supplied hours of fun for my 5 yo old. I purchased the matching furniture and I agree some pieces are to large but she still uses them, once the castle is opened up the atrium area is large enough to use them. I also purchased a few playmobil sets like the other reviewers suggested.I also strung a set of 50 white xmas lights inside since some of the rooms are dark."
5673,Hair Revive Natural Defense for Women,4/4,1.0,"I take 4 of these a day. I am now into my second bottle and have seen zero difference.I stopped using chemical shampoo and conditioner. I changed to Wen cleansing conditioner, Wen SixThirteen treatment, Rene Furterer Thin Hair Treatment and will be starting to use John Masters Organic shampoo and Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment & Volumizer as soon as it gets here (I've just read some really bad reviews for the Wen hair system, so I'm going to stop using it). I've also tried Castor oil/Jojoba oil scalp treatments. I stopped chemically coloring my hair and use Henna, Amla and Herbatint ONLY. I will never use chemicals on my hair again.I take Biotin, fish oil and Hair Revive (among other supplements). I've been taking these since October and with these and everything else I have been doing for my hair loss, I see no improvement and it may even be worse. Not only have these not worked, THEY TASTE AWFUL. REALLY, REALLY awful.I take a lot of supplements and out of them all, this is the only one that has a taste (VERY BAD TASTE) and makes me gag. I can taste the ingredients through the thin capsule. I'll probably finish the last bottle just because I hate wasting things, but will more than likely not buy these again. If they worked, I'd force myself to take them despite the horrid taste, but as far as I can tell, they do nothing for my hair loss - Your mileage may vary, but I wanted to tell my story which does vary from the 4/5 star reviews (which is why I bought it).I rarely leave 1 or 2 star reviews, but I felt this product didn't deserve more from me. You will have to decide if you want to spend the money and see if it works for you. I wish you much luck and hope it does."
5674,Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush,0/0,2.0,Boooooo! After 6 months my battery no longer charges. I called Sonicare and did a &#34;reset&#34; on the product without luck. I must have been stuck with a bad one.
5675,Pencil Grip,0/0,3.0,But other than that I don't see any other revolutionary benefits. ... ... ... . . . . .. . ..
5676,"biUbe Aquarium with LED Light, Black, 9 Gallons",0/0,2.0,"I've had one of these for several years now, and although it looks stylish, it is not great to maintain and your options regarding fish and plants are quite limited. I've being doing weekly partial water changes, but the chunky ceramic media makes it very difficult to hoover up the debris with a gravel cleaner. Plus the fact that the filtration unit is right in the centre of the tank, limiting your space when you clean. My local aquarium shop says the filtration is not particularly good on these tanks, and I've been boosting mine with a small internal unit. Also, you can't really grow much in these tanks, so you are limited to artificial plants if you want to decorate your tank (there are plenty of such accessories sold for the Biorb and Biube.) It's fine for a starter tank with say a handful of small tropical fish, but that's about it."
5677,Melissa & Doug Frolicking Horses Jigsaw (48 pc),0/0,5.0,"My four-year-old granddaughter LOVES this puzzle... Starting with corners, she adds the side pieces & then fills in all the animals & names them... Wonderful in all respects..."
5678,"Greenies Pill Pockets for Cats, 1.6-Ounce",0/0,5.0,My Maine Coon is 3 ft long and 24 lbs solid muscle with big teeth. I love it when the vet expects you to shove a pill down his throat. It aint happening! The cat has heart issues at 10 yrs old and needs his pills to stay alive. He loves these treats and when I put the pills inside them with one hand and hand it to him with the other he readily gobbles it up. The fact that they are so mushy and pliable make the pill stick to it even when he chews. Never touch the pocket with the hand you handled pill with. Cats will smell it and wont eat the pocket and will remember for a few days. These things are a life saver.
5679,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"I got it as a gift and while I would like it as a darker pink like the photo, it's a really bright hot pink. It is streaky, so you have to wear 2-3 coats. It's a cute summer color"
5680,"Matrix Amplify Color XL Shampoo, 33.8-Ounce Bottle",1/1,5.0,Cuz I like the Matrix products and this shampoo makes my hair looks great and it shines. Just love it
5681,Petmate Indigo Dog House Door,0/0,1.0,"this product makes my dog very skeptical of the house it is on. doesn't seem to help too much with the temperture since it does not close all the way on the house. a better idea is to place dog house opening away from wind direction and you should have the same concept. may be a good product for those that have dogs already comfortable with dog house, just didn't work for me."
5682,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,Very nice blue color... very soothing on the eyes. Easy application. Great nail polish! As expected with Zoya. Thank you :)
5683,5 pack of Litter Locker Plus Refill Cartridge,1/2,3.0,"Picture appears to be authenticate product but is not when received. Is a cheaper knock off and can have problems with the plastic spooling off. 3 out of 5 cartridges after removing the plastic ring for use have a problem with releasing the plastic. I've had to literally break the permanent top ring to get it started. It seems when it's manufactured the plastic ring is adhered to the product and the bags cannot release. If you don't mind fighting with these a bit, it's cheaper than buying in the store."
5684,Maurer & Wirtz Tabac Original Afterhsave,0/0,5.0,I doesn't stink up a room hours after you leave but it is remembered..... I think that's better thank making people choke...
5685,Neutrogena Body Clear Body,0/0,5.0,I am somewhat new to this product. I did do research before I chose this body wash and so far I must say that it is working well and is clearing up the break-outs on my back.
5686,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,1.0,I received the plastic one instead of what's in the picture which I purchased because of the price. I felt deceived
5687,Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer,0/0,5.0,"This hair dryer is small and easy to handle, but the best thing is the air flow. Many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description, but this one truly has turbo air flow. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining."
5688,Obsession Night Eau de Parfum for Women by Calvin Klein,0/0,4.0,"He comprado este perfume para mi chica y le gusto mucho.Se respira un Buen aroma, sensual y seduciente....Lo recomendo."
5689,"Wellements Organic Gripe Water for Colic, 4 Fluid Ounce",0/0,4.0,"This product works as soon as you give it to your infant, it soothes their stomach and my son would calm down and go right to sleep after this dosage."
5690,Stetson Stetson Sierra Cologne,0/0,5.0,The only cologne I have used since it came out years ago. It is great. Will never change. Be hard past to replace it.
5691,Olay Olay Complete All Day Uv Defense Moisture Lotion,0/0,5.0,I've started paying more attention to my face as I got older. This moisturizer is an added plus to my daily regime and the spf is always helpful for summer or winter skin protection. I received it on time and would recommend to others.
5692,Nylabone Durable Dental Dinosaur Chew Toy (Dinosaur Varies),0/0,5.0,"A neighbor's dog has this and every time we go visit, my dog would dig through his toys to get it. I have been looking everywhere for it and was thrilled to find it here on Black Friday at a great price. My girl was so excited when I pulled it out of her stocking for Christmas! Of the 5 toys she got, she jumped on this one first and more often. She's a power chewer so these types of toys are awesome for her."
5693,Kidkraft Derby Rocking Horse,0/0,5.0,Derby horse was perfect gift for my grandson. He loves it. Gift was delivered promptly. The look on my grandson's face says it all
5694,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,5.0,"I am a sucker for old movies, and this was a great buy that I couldnt pass up. Cheap price and the product came very fast! The movie was sealed and not scratched. Could not have got a better deal anywhere else."
5695,Dentemp O.S. Dentemp O.S. One Step Filling Dental Repair Material Maximum Hold,0/0,1.0,"Awful! This is a terrible product. Did not work, dry and sadly those who would order need it. Remove from your stock."
5696,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,1/1,5.0,"Price was right, lots of steps makes it easier for small dogs, high enough for tall beds and carpet pads for the steps, what's not to like!"
5697,Summer Infant Mommies Melodies Gund Bear,0/0,5.0,We've had it as a gift from my mother in law.........kid LOVES it. He is apt enough to wake up and turn it on himself! Only lasts about 15 mins which gives you just the right amount of time to read to baby before placing baby into crib and turn the music back on again. Don't leave home without it!!!
5698,Badger Basket Gingham 3-in-1 Doll Pram Carrier And Stroller - Pink/White,0/0,5.0,"bought this for my granddaughter, who is six and tall, i was nervous it would be to small for her. it is taller than the ones in the store, it is the right size for her and she loves it."
5699,PetQwerks Talking Babble Ball Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"I really like this toy- it's fun. Our puppy loved it. Unfortunately, our older dog found it much too exciting and drove us bananas yapping at it and trying to kill it! I had to hide it away on a shelf and I suspect it won't reappear ...It seems sturdy enough and a nice toy for a less excitable dog, but you definitely wouldn't leave a chewer with it."
5700,Conair Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron,0/0,5.0,Takes any frizz out of my hair and adds volume. Heats up quickly. A lot of settings for heat and can get very hot. Easy to use.
5701,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/0,5.0,What can I say about Duracell Coppertop Duralock D Batteries other than they can be depended on to work for long periods of time and never had a problem with them.I would recommend them to my friends.
5702,Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,0/0,5.0,Lionel Polar Express Train Set-G-GageMy grandson played with this train non stop! Drove his sister crazy! My daughter said it was perfect around the tree.Batteries you sent were dead and my daughter had to buy new batteries as train wouldn't run!Was a little upsetting to the 5 year old.
5703,Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate,0/0,5.0,"Very sturdy, easy to put up, and the handle comes up to your waist. Since I was using this for the cat, I didn't have to use any screws or tape."
5704,Cloud b Sound Machine Soother,0/0,5.0,"My son loves to chew on this. The play setting drumbeats are incredibly upbeat and fun! I do find the sleep (mother's heartbeat) to be a bit on the creepy raspy breathing side, but my son likes it and falls asleep to it easily. It also looks incredibly life like and has a sweet little face, it sits up so tall that it encourage my baby to lift his head to stare at it in the mornings,which is just adorable to see. The box had a wonderful presentation that it came in if you are into astehtics and something I wasn't expecting it came with a small booklet and adoption paper that I could read to my son. I am considering their night light turtle toy because of the quality of this."
5705,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,"This stuff is amazing. My cat will be loving and sweet and perfect, but she has anxiety and when she is afraid she turns into a completely different animal. She will attack anyone around her. I tried multiple treatments to help her anxiety, including prozac. Nothing worked. I got this stuff and it's great. It mellows her out and keeps her calm without completely knocking her out and making her woozy like the prozac did. It's not a miracle. She still has her fits from time to time, but it definitely helps and it's the best thing I've found."
5706,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,"Got this for my 8-yr old daughter for xmas. She likes watching me build stuff, so I thought she might like this. Turns out she does. she got up the next morning and kept making projects in the book. she was very proud to tell me she got through number 5 before I got up. looks like the Easter Bunny might have to bring the next advanced set."
5707,Lovely Eau de Parfum for Women by Sarah Jessica Parker,1/1,5.0,This was a gift for my wife. We have not viewed it yet. It arrived in great shape. Thank you.
5708,Multiple Vitamins & Minerals - Active Senior's Formula,0/0,5.0,"Excellent product,very happy with it. We have tried many Vitamins over the years and I think this is one of the best and priced right.We will continue to purchase this product."
5709,Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord,1/2,5.0,"My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it. Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on."
5710,Stainless Steel Pet Coop Cup,0/0,5.0,I have these mounted in all my kennels. I hate leaving bowls out and want my dogs to eat standing up. These are super easy to install and I can take the dish out when I'm done. It's a good deep dish and easy to clean. I've tried other brands and styles and this is the best and most affordable I have found!
5711,Melissa & Doug Shape Sorting Cube,0/0,2.0,"I loved the idea of a wooden toy - durable, high quality, etc. I have gotten my daughter a number of toys from various wooden toy makers and European toy makers. I ordered this shape sorter and am not happy with the product. The newer version (we got this for Xmas 2012) has a plywood box, and it is unfinished. I don't have a problem with unfinished wood or plywood, except many of the box's edges (outside and within the shape holes themselves) are poorly cut and VERY jagged. It is unpleasant to touch, but the biggest problem of course is that it can give you splinters. SPLINTERS! Really, Melissa and Doug? Have you downgraded your quality so much in favor of upping your profit? I won't be ordering again."
5712,Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades,1/1,4.0,"Great blades to get a close shave. I have very sensitive skin, so a razor that is sharp and only requires 1-2 passes is great."
5713,biOrb Service Kit,0/0,5.0,"I replace my biOrb filter system only about every 4-5 months; my biOrb tank continues to stay clean and algae-free. Amazon.com makes ordering quick and easy, with competitive pricing."
5714,X-zylo Gyro Night Flight,0/0,2.0,"I was a bit disappointed with this toy. It just seemed to be much less exciting than the reviews and description. It is literally a thin plastic ring into which two glow sticks are inserted. We tried throwing it several ways, but it did not impress. I am just puzzled that anyone would find it fascinating. Sorry."
5715,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/1,1.0,"Bought this for my wife and thought the fragrance that lasts only 30 minutes was normal, until she bought one from a department store. The store bought fragrance lasted for hours and hours.My experience with this product bought from Amazon does not reflect the usual high quality of its products. I do not recommend this product at all."
5716,Original Diet Patch 30 Patches By Dermathol,0/0,1.0,What else needs to be said? It didn't even stick well enough to be a bandage! I don't know why I wasted my money.
5717,Natural Factors DGL Licorice Root Extract,1/1,5.0,These tablets really taste terrible but they seem to work (I can tell whenI don't take them). If you can stand the taste they are great.
5718,Body Bare Intimate Sensitive Area Shaver with Free Ladyfair Bikini Line Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"My wife and I love being able to go bare, it doesn't nick things only thing you have to remember it works only on stubble, and use baby powder"
5719,"Blue Ribbon Collection, Bread Machine Mixes (Buttermilk White, Big Sky, Summerhill Irish Oat, Sour Cream Onion)",0/0,5.0,All breads I've made have turned out great and are extremely easy to make. Have already ordered more types of breads to make. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants good and easy to make bread.
5720,B-12 Dots by Twinlab,1/1,5.0,I had stopped taking this product because I was taking a stress B-Complex. But my energy level dropped and was not what I wanted it to be. I add this product back and my energy level came back up. I'm very pleased with it.
5721,"Harry Potter 9.75"" Hagrid Deluxe Action Figure with Sound",0/0,4.0,"I enjoy a lot, it's perfect in all details. My daugther loved.Unfortunately doen't arrived for Christmas, so I need to buy another Xmas gift for her, but it doen't matter.Best regards."
5722,Pressure Pointer - Foot Powered Self Massage Trigger Point Therapy Tool,0/0,5.0,"I've tried every trigger point product on the market - Theracane, Backknobber, Bongers, spiny balls - all are helpful, but the Pressure Pointer is by far the best. The foot control allows for more consistent, constant, deeper pressure, and relieves arm and shoulder exertion while treating the area - which really matters if your trigger points are located in the shoulder girdle or SCM. Make sure you have the Clair Davies manual "" The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"
5723,"Braun Thermoscan Pro 4000 Ear Thermometer, Aural Thermometer",2/3,5.0,"Can you buy a $5 oral thermometer and do the same thing? Of course. Can you buy another aural thermometer to do the same job? Of course. But if you're in the market for a quality, medical grade, piece of healthcare equipment...this is a great piece. Solid feel, no-fail electronics...fits perfectly into the cradle (which holds ear cups). Quick readings within seconds. So again, can you do the same job for less? Absolutely. But nothing will have the style and quality of this. As a pediatrician and a father, I love this thing."
5724,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,3.0,I didnt like the thick way it went on or the way it peeled off The SAME day :( not happy with it
5725,Phillips Light Touch Salon Brush,0/0,5.0,These are the only brushes I have used for the past 40 years. They last a long time and are perfect for my long thick hair. They are a favorite of my children and grandchildren
5726,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,great little toy for my dogs. i have yorkies so they love it and it comes with an extra squeaker.
5727,Lehigh Spontex 20005 Bluettes Knit Rubber Glove,5/5,5.0,"Amazon's site lists next to nothing about these gloves, including the SIZE! I'm here to help.These are terrific, long-lasting, LATEX-FREE gloves that will save hands from heat, water,and chemical abuse.The only thing I find them a little challenging to use with is washing fine, thin, crystal stemware. These have a little too much bulk for me to feel safe using them for that, but for everything else they are fabulous!I'm including information about the gloves for those who need to know glove construction and sizing details.Invest in a pair and save a pair of hands! Note"
5728,FOREVER KRYSTLE Women Eau de Toilette 1 Spray,0/0,4.0,Hard to find product! Thank you for still having some. Its a 20 dollar product but since they no longer make it its a lot more money and my mother doesn't smell like her without it I paid the money for it. It came to me in good condition.
5729,Natural Balance Happy Camper,0/0,5.0,"My daughter has been taking these for about a year. She recommended them to my husband. He had just not feeling &#34;himself&#34;. Both he and I noticed an improvement in his mood within a week. Not sure if it is a &#34;placebo&#34; effect or not, but I do know that he is generally a happier person. He had a little trouble with sleeping after he first started them, but that disappeared. All in all, a good product."
5730,Prince Lionheart Dresser Top Diaper Depot,0/0,5.0,"Used at my daughters house. Liked it so much, bought it for a friend's new baby. She loves it, too. Great for keeping baby supply clutter under control."
5731,"KONG Squeaker Tennis Balls Dog Toy, 3-Pack",0/0,5.0,"Serious caution must be used to prevent larger dogs from swallowing or inhaling these, but outside of that, these balls are great! Like most dog toys, these should only be used with supervision. We have had a small terrier rip them apart and remove the squeaker in just a few moments. We don't know if he may have ingested the part. Haven't noticed any squeaky flatulence, so I think we're good. As for our flat-faced little dogs, this is an ideal toy because they can get it their mouth. They can't sqeak them on their own so we assist them. The noise drives the little guys into a wide-eyed play/hunt mode. Fun."
5732,"Multipet Deedle Dude Singing White Rabbit Plush Dog Toy, 8-Inch",0/0,5.0,"I bought a different one last year, and my dogs love the sounds it makes. Very cute! Highly recommend it."
5733,North American Bear Company Rosy Cheeks Baby Blonde Boy,0/0,5.0,"My grandson loves the softness of the baby doll. He sleeps with him. I love the size also, not too small or too big, just right!"
5734,Clinique Happy Heart Perfume Spray,0/0,5.0,Product was described correctly. Good price. Would definitly buy this again for my wife. Why do I have to write 20 or more words?
5735,Desolv It Citrus Solution 12.6oz,0/0,4.0,"I needed something to remove the dried glue under the carpet and sound padding I ripped out of my track car. This stuff works well, especially if you allow it to soak a few hours and then use an abrasive nylon pad, either by hand or on a sanding disc. Not perfect, as some glue just WILL NOT come off without sanding it off, but decent."
5736,Wind-Up Submarine,0/0,4.0,"It's a sub for playing in the bathtub, so don't get giant expectations people! My son enjoys playing with it. The swimming mechanism is a little difficult and it doesn't float upright on it's own, but seriously - it was a few bucks, looks cool, and my son likes using it. Enough said!"
5737,"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"These cups are good. Baby learned to drink out of them at about 9-10 months. It does take a pretty strong suck to get the water out when the guard is on, but baby does it fine. My only complaint about using them with a younger baby is that the baby has a hard time holding them high enough to tip them up. A cup with handles would probably be easier for a young baby."
5738,Toysmith Kids Cash Box,0/0,5.0,"I gave this gift to my neices for Christmas. I get tired of just giving them money, so I filled it with cash and gave it to them. Just like I remember having one when I was a kid. My neices are between five and nine and each of them loved it. There is only one number on the combination so it's not like it's a Fort Knox or anything, but it's great fun and nice for each kid to have their own &#34;stash&#34;."
5739,Gold Magic Brass Pressing Comb Double Fine 42 Teeth,0/0,1.0,"Sent this comb back to the vendor. The description failed to note that the base of the comb has teeth; for some people, this is fine, but I prefer using a pressing comb that has a solid base.I am giving this review the lowest score because it was not what I expected and does not reflect upon the vendor itself for their service was expedient."
5740,Learning Resources - Pretend and Play Healthy Dinner Set,1/1,1.0,"This toy is unlike the other Learning Resources toy. It's made of soft plastic & has a smell. The carrots are too small. I don't like it. The food items don't look very real. In fact, some looks awful. The Activity Card is missing from my package. But thanks to Amazon's customer-centric service, they gave me a refund. You can give this a miss. Too costly for the poor quality."
5741,Nipple Nibblers Strawberry,0/0,5.0,Love It! It's cool sensation coupled with the yummy strawberry flavor is a Treat for Both Of Us!! Highly Recommend!! ;-D
5742,"Clif Shot Bloks Organic Energy Chews, 2.1-Ounce Packets",0/0,5.0,Great tasting easy to use product that sits nicely in your back pocket while riding no matter what the temperature is.
5743,Melissa & Doug See & Spell,0/0,5.0,My son LOVES this toy!!!! Very educational. Melissa and Doug toys have truly helped my son develop. Love their toys
5744,Revlon Frost & Glow Highlighting Kit 1 ea,2/2,4.0,"First of all, I did need my husband's help for this but I imagine someone could do it on their own. For me, this way was just easier and more efficient.It left highlights all over. I got compliments for the color (even though I thought it was too brassy and yellow but not golden).Overall, it did the job. It gave even highlights through virgin and dark colored multiple times sections of hair. I would recommend it and use it again."
5745,"PAIR of Thermoskin Carpal Tunnel Braces with Dorsal Stay, Black , Left & Right",0/0,4.0,"These are long term wearer braces.They support really well, and fit me, approx 150 lb. 5'11&#34; male very well.Neoprene-esque cloth is nice and soft, and keeps the wrists warm and the muscles relaxed.Metal is very solid and has that firm support needed.Velcro and straps are very good and provide a tight fit without scratching or irritating.Can be used while performing other activites, though not exercise, as this is not the primary focus of the product.Can be used while typing, but not the best for typing.The only issue I have with these are sometimes I wear my braces, and i like to take them on and off often (between meals, etc.) This pair is very hard to get on and off because of how secure and how many velcro latches there are. In some instances i find myself pinching my wrist briefly trying to pull up the two back velcro latches. The main velcro latch is perfect though. This however, does not detract from the quality of the long term wear.Product functions well. Odor should go away after a careful wash."
5746,Bass Brushes Lg. Oval Hair Brush Wood Bristles,0/0,5.0,"This brush is beautiful! It disperses your hair's natural oils throughout your hair for healthy, shiny locks. It feels nice on the scalp and detangles my hair well."
5747,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Figure,0/0,5.0,This product is of high quality for my son. He lovesI recommend this toy to everyone for their excellent design
5748,Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion 10 percent Glycolic AHA -- 6 fl oz,0/0,2.0,"This product seems to be doing its job, my skin is soft and smooth and feels great!However the downside would be the smell of this product. It's not horrible... just unpleasant. The offensive odor doesn't linger overly long, it's mostly gone within 15-30 minutes, but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream, which has almost no odor at all."
5749,Original Gyroscope / Boxed,0/0,1.0,"It's good when it works, but it's not good quality, so it isn't perfectly balanced. That said, it doesn't stay spinning long and it doesn't perform like a good gyroscope. String to wind it is pretty cheap quality too."
5750,Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Musical Activity Keys,0/0,5.0,"I could not find this toy in any of my local stores, so I was excited when I found it online. Excellent product and the price was reasonable."
5751,Healthdri Mens Heavy Brief,1/1,1.0,"This brief does absorb; the challenge with itis that it has no water / liquid proof liner to keep the moisture from transferring to clothing, furniture and or bedding.I would not purchase it again."
5752,"Bee Propolis 500mg - 100 caps,(Good'n Natural)",1/1,5.0,Works great for my nasal allergys and at a fair price. I have trouble finding this product in stores. I recommend this product for sinus allergys..
5753,Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet,0/0,5.0,This is easy to set up and sturdy. Great for the progression of their growth and developement. Now I can use it for the second grandchild as the first has moved to a toddler stage.
5754,Pass the Pigs,0/0,5.0,We've had this game for years and enjoy getting it out and playing it with new people. it makes a great gift
5755,All Purpose Cleaner Degreaser 32 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I've been using this cleaner for years and we have gotten to the point where BioKleen All Purpose is the only cleaner we have in the house. I use it for EVERYTHING - kitchen counters, oven/stove, toilet, tub/showers, tile floors, walls, carpet, glass. The only other cleaner I use is some diluted Murphy's Oil Soap for wood and Lysol Spray for raw meat spillage (because I don't want to take risks with that). Otherwise, it's BioKleen All Purpose all the way!!I have 2 All Purpose spray bottles purchased years ago and now I just dilute the concentrate and refill the bottles as needed. One for the kitchen, one for the bathrooms. I love it so much that I've since expanded into laundry products, fabric refresher, dishwashing supplies, drain cleaner, etc. We cloth diaper and have 2 large dogs and the Bac-Out in particular has been a lifesaver. Everything has a light, clean, NATURAL smell... so when you're cleaning, you get the feeling you're hanging out in an orange grove instead of a chemical plant. My favorite is the Lemon Thyme fabric refresher. Amazing!!The only thing I've found that I don't like is the Produce Wash, and that's only because we despise the smell of licorice.I do wish they would create a line of biodegradable, disposable wipes for on-the-go, like diaper bags or for quick clean ups around the house. I like to wipe down restaurant eating surfaces before my kids touch them, so for now I use a small spray bottle with the diluted All Purpose spray and wipe with some of their cloth diaper wipes, and it works like a charm."
5756,Simply One Prenatal Power Vitamins,0/0,5.0,"I love this prenatal vitamin. I have used it for 2 pregnancies and have had nothing but great results. It was super easy on my stomach during the first trimester...which is very important!! Also, I still use it even though my baby is 3 months old. I love that it has an extra 1000 mg of Folic acid which is very important.I just started buying this on amazon since the fancy health food stores try to sell it for a lot more."
5757,Roux Fanci-Full Rinse,0/0,5.0,Had a bad experience with color at a salon and this works great to cover up the error until it can grow out and be cut off.
5758,Benefiber Powder,0/0,5.0,"Great flavor and love it!Great fast shipment!Great for regulating fiber!What else can I say, this site keeps asking for more words!!! Oh brother!"
5759,Nature's Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System for Males (1 Month Supply),0/0,1.0,"Product did not work, waste of money! based on reviews i gave it a try and i was completely disappointed!"
5760,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz. A-List,0/0,4.0,"Bought this after seeing it won some beauty award and I was looking for a nice neutral pink. It is pretty but it very sheer, like clear nail polished classed up a notch. Pretty, but nothing special. No problems with chipping etc."
5761,Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat,0/0,5.0,"It is very easy to install and my dog loves it. I love it too. She loves to ride in the car and now she can relax and look out both windows with ease. I love knowing she will be safer if I have to stop fast or, heaven forbid, I'm in an accident."
5762,Graco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base,0/0,4.0,"Very Pleased with this purchase, great price but expensive shipping. The exact base we where looking for for the newest car seat purchase"
5763,East Cape Manuka Strong Oil,0/0,5.0,"i suffered 7 yrs with a painful rash, this oil, manuka wound honey and the soap worked and finally i have my life back after years of doctors and pills and precriptions that didn't work. its totally amazing."
5764,"Holiday Tea Blend, 20 Sachets in a tin by Harney & Sons",0/0,5.0,"I love this holiday tea blend. However, I ordered it on November 1, intending to serve it at a Thanksgiving Day brunch. I didn't get it until a week after Thanksgiving. I was very disappointed. I will only order direct from the seller in the future."
5765,Lipo-Flavonoid Plus,0/0,3.0,I bought this for myself and my husband to try. We both have ringing in our ears and have for quite some time. My husband did notice a difference but I never did. Might be a good idea to try since it seems to work for some.
5766,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Latches Board,0/0,4.0,"We purchased this toy for our 2 year old boy who loves anything mechanical and is very interested in seeing how things are put together and taken apart, etc. He really enjoyed all the different latches and locks; however, after owning it for less than 24 hours the coating began peeling from a corner since my son was trying to open one of the doors from there. With a little glue, it is almost as good as new but part of the picture is now torn off from the door. Also, it is relatively heavy for a toddler and if carrying around and trips, the pointy metals parts could be a problem. Overall, we like the product and would recommend it (with supervision for young children) but just wish it was a little more hearty."
5767,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,My black cat looks so regal in her new fleece bed. She loves it!! She always feels nice & warm after she gets up from this bed.
5768,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,MUCH BETTER THAN DR BROWNS' BOTTLE BRUSH. EASY TO RUN THROUGH THE DISHWASHER AND EASY TO USE IN BORN FREE BOTTLES.
5769,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my grandchild, keep in mind I have bought/collected Lionel trains for over 50 years, for Christmas. I started out a couple months back with Thomas set to see how he would take care of it. Since he did very well I decided to move him up to the ""O"" gauge Polar Express since he was infatuated with the movie, etc. We set it up on Christmas Day and it was a treat for all until about 1 hr later it stopped working. I called Lionel the next day and explained the symptoms to wit they said the engine was shorted and needed repair. I could send it in and get it back in 3 or 4 weeks, bring it locally for repair (2 months) or return it for a refund. I decided to return it and order a replacement. Received my replacement from AMAZON the next day (THEY ARE THE GREATEST!!!!!) and have shipped the old one back for refund.It is really too bad that these have to be made in China now because they are nowhere near the quality of what we expect from Lionel. The box says they are located in Chesterfield, IL but I have been there and there are only maybe 3 people left at that facility. Most personnel are now located in N. Carolina, and Ohio. Another American industry, known for high quality, now producing inferior goods outside the USA. LIONEL, Inc,,,,please get your act together and bring the quality back to the model train industry and make these in the US.I am hoping this was an fluke but I see others who have experienced issues. When they work it is great....time will tellI would be real sad if it were not for the customer service at Amazon. BTW, the customer service at Lionel was very prompt and courteous too. If yours works these are a great choice. I gave it 3 stars because I expected, for the price, that this train would be QC'd and work. Here's hoping that this unit lasts many years. I have other Lionels that are over 70 years old and running great....I don't think these new units are up to that longevity. Happy New Year to all the other Polar Express lovers out there...it is always great to hear the bell ringing, no matter what your age."
5770,Learning Resources Cooking Set,0/0,5.0,"My two and a half year old grandson loved this cooking set. It's bright, colorful, and durable and made for little hands."
5771,Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Creme-2 oz,0/0,5.0,This product is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin - with no oily reside. After only a couple of weeks I can see a major difference!
5772,Kai Perfume by Gaye Straza for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,Bought this for both of my step-daughters. They both loved it! Not surprised since they both specifically requested it for X-mas.
5773,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,1/1,5.0,Our Maine Coon is 13. He is huge and is having some issues jumping so we got this one for our bedroom. He sleeps in there during the days since we are doing construction and the cats feel safe in our bedroom. He weighs 26 pounds and its no issue for his weight. Also our other cat who has trouble with her vision likes to use it as she can slowly go up and see who is on the bed etc. our bed is high and its perfect height were the next step up is the bed. I would purchase this product again and its easy to clean. Our smaller one we got at a pet store has a cover but no matter how many times we wash it...weekly it does still always have hair on it. This is very strong for your pet and does not wobble at all. Our cats love it
5774,LANCOME by Lancome Le Stylo Waterproof Long Lasting Eyeliner - Noir - 0.29g/0.01oz,0/0,5.0,"Adoro marca e seus produtos! O produto &eacute; maravilhoso de alta qualidade , possui uma variedade de opes de produtos e cores!"
5775,Hair Therapy Wrap,0/0,3.0,"This product should mention it's dimension because it does not work for long hair. The heat level it's good but only have it on the front and the sides, back part I did not feel it. The ear protecting pads on long hair does not go on top of ear. So if you have medium to short hair this is something you want to invest your money other wise not."
5776,Pour Homme Soir Eau de Toilette for Men by Bvlgari,0/0,5.0,This is the stuff yov only dream abovt when yov have the kind of dreams yov want to remember.

5778,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden USA Map Sound Puzzle,0/0,4.0,This puzzle is nice. The state borders and cutouts are not precise though and some states are cutout together. The talking is nice and it will last a long time!
5779,Salonpas Pain Relieving Patch - 120 Patches,0/0,5.0,heard about these from someone and have been thanking her since. these are really great! they work! i have chronic lower back aches and i put these on when i went to a three hour movie (Les Mis - amazing btw and you should really go see it!). I didnt think about my back hurting even once - which goes to show how well they work! Will be buying more and you cant beat the price!
5780,Oralflo Pill Swallowing Cup,0/0,5.0,"I really wish I would have gotten this when I first heard about it, it just seemed like it wouldn't work. I was pretty skeptical but it had become a real chore breaking up capsules and praying my son wouldn't vomit up his nasty tasty vitamins. He is 4, I don't know if it would work with smaller kids but it cuts soo much time now."
5781,"Earth Therapeutics, Natural Bristle Cushion Brush",0/0,1.0,"I read the reviews and throught for sure that this brush would work on my course textured hair, but I just cannot get a good thorough brush stroke through my hair with it. Would not buy it again."
5782,Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer,1/1,4.0,"We use this dryer when we in Europe. It is small and packs well, and works like a dryer should. Nothing negative to say, but it is just a travel dryer, and 5 stars seemed a bit much."
5783,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my Yorkie!! He LOVES it!! It is like a small rodent, which he likes to chase. I am pleased. Thank you!!"
5784,Polly Pocket Case - Colors May Vary,0/0,5.0,This toy is awesome because it holds the polly pocket stuff and hold the dolls. It is pretty and in good condition . That's why I gave this review 5 stars .
5785,Sinucleanse Sinucleanse Neti Pot All Natural Nasal Wash System Kit,0/0,5.0,"i use this all the time. I find it helps with sinus pain, allergies, colds etc. It works really well. It takes a bit of getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it is amazing. I highly recommend this."
5786,Squigle Enamel Saver Toothpaste,1/1,5.0,This toothpaste does a good job cleaning and whitening my teeth without giving me any tooth pain. I've read that normal toothpastes can actually make your teeth more yellow by scraping off the enamel and revealing the yellow colored dentine beneath the enamel. This toothpaste helps save your enamel making your teeth whiter without being too rough on them.
5787,Desert Essence - Tea Tree Oil & Neem Toothpaste,0/0,5.0,"This is my absolute, all-time favorite toothpaste. Not only is it natural and good for you, but it leaves a wonderful taste of fennel in your mouth. I can't seem to find this flavor in the stores in my area. A little pricier than other name brands, but it is so worth it. Other toothpaste brands make me gag when I first wake up, but I look forward to this one. I usually buy several at a time to reduce shipping costs."
5788,"Nerve Support Formula for Relief of Peripheral, Diabetic & Poly Neuropathy Nerve Pain",0/0,5.0,"seems to help with the pain. i take 10 to 15 a day, depending on the severety. hope it works!"

5791,"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Black",0/0,5.0,"Just like it says, it is tough. My extreme chewer hasn't even left a tooth mark in it yet. I can recommend this for big dogs."
5792,Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer,0/0,5.0,Bought this for my daughter who has 2 month old twin boys. She loves it! Has a little alarm that goes off when its time for a programmed item. So glad I got it!
5793,LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166),0/0,5.0,"Exactly what you'd hope for in a Lego set -- open-ended play, enough bricks and accessories to build lots of different things."
5794,"YS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC HONEY Raw, Unprocessed, Unpasteurized - Kosher 32oz",1/1,5.0,"I've been ordering this honey for over a year now (my first jar lasted almost a year.. this last time my 32 oz jar only lasted 3 months!!). Not only does it taste great, but it also helps with those sugar spikes I tend to get throughout the day, especially right after eating. I am not a diabetic but I used to get hungry right after I ate and I got those ravaging hunger pangs with irritability and even lightheadedness. When I use this honey I don't get those anymore.I take honey water along with me during my outings in the summer. Not so great in the winter because it solidifies as it cools, becomes grainy/sandy and tickles my throat in an uncomfortable way as it goes down. I haven't figured out how to get around this yet without using a heavy thermos (I like carrying a lightweight bottle in my purse). I have yet to convert my family from the liquid store stuff, but I am completely hooked!"
5795,THERANEEM MAX CLEANSING BAR,1/1,4.0,"I don't have a particular skin problem, although I'm susceptible to acne -- on my back and face, and my face is very sensitive to chemicals. This soap doesn't cause my face to break out and is very safe. I did not notice any particular positive results, however. The odor of the soap is so mild it's unnoticeable. It suds up well and although it's a small bar, it lasts quite a while. I wish I had some ""miracle"" to report but I don't. I can't even say that the soap made my skin noticeably softer or smoother. All I can say is that it does no harm and is safe to use on a face with sensitive,complex skin."
5796,Pino Sylvestre Cologne by Pino Sylvestre for men Colognes,0/0,5.0,this was from my wife to me she likes the smell and that what count right guys lol fast shipping and was in my hands before i even noticed the charge on our account so far so good
5797,Philips Sonicare Elite e7300 Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,Glad I made the switch to Sonicare. I have had this model over 2 years and it still works like new. My teeth feel great and I have not been getting any cavities.

5800,Radio Flyer 12S Classic Walker Wagon,0/0,5.0,I would recommend this walker wagon. This is made very sturdy and the paint job is nicely done. It is great for a 1 year old who is getting ready to walk. This will not tip over. Children will love to put things in and out of this adorable wagon.This was a great purchase!!!Deb from NJ

5803,KONG Stuff-A-Ball Dog Toy,1/1,5.0,"Stuffing this with a variety of treats, peanut butter, cheese, etc., keeps my chewer occupied for quite a long time. Good value."
5804,Stresstabs Stresstabs High Potency Stress Formula Advanced Tablets,1/1,5.0,"My wife has used these stress tabs for quite a while and she knows what to expect with them. It is getting harder to find them at her regular source so when she does find them , she buys several boxes. It is also nice to find them at a good price and at a place where she knows she'll get good service. Thank you."
5805,Little Tikes EasyStore Large Slide,0/0,3.0,"Bought this slide as a gift for my grandson to use as an inside slide. Love the slide, but can't get the platform piece on the bottom to fit. That was why I bought this slide because thought it would be more stable."
5806,"Maybelline Full 'N Soft Mascara, Very Black - .28 oz",0/0,3.0,"I have used several of these, on recommendation that it is very good for the price. But I realized that after a certain amount of time, like 3-4 weeks, it starts flaking badly and irritates my eyes."
5807,So De La Renta By Oscar De La Renta For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"Live the smell of this perfume, I always get lots of complements when I where it. It's hard to find in the stores and this is a great price and fast shipping."
5808,"Navitas Naturals Organic Mulberries Turkish Superfruit, 16-Ounce Pouch",0/0,1.0,"I absolutely love Navitas mulberries, but they seem to have a problem with quality control. The bag I received was very moist and had many moldy berries. Amazon refunded the purchase price, which I appreciated."
5809,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/1,3.0,"First of all, it's a beautiful, heavyweight razor. I had no problem switching to it or figuring it out after switching from a disposable. But the shave was nothing better than my Gillette Custom Plus 3 disposable gave me. In fact, it wasn't as good. I still have it, but never use it. Maybe some day."
5810,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my Yorkie!! He LOVES it!! It is like a small rodent, which he likes to chase. I am pleased. Thank you!!"
5811,Carex Raised Toilet Seat,0/0,4.0,"My mother broke her hip and when we got her home I was told by many that this would really help her. This is a great product and is simple to install, no hardware, it just sits firmly in the bowl. However, I should have done a bit more research because they are not all the same thickness. This one is so high my mother's feet don't come close to touching the floor which she does not like. There are seats like this that are not as thick, which we are now going to purchase. Not the fault of the manufacturer, this product shipped fast and is great, I just wanted to let others know of my mistake in not researching which one my mom needed."
5812,Source Naturals Progesterone Cream,2/2,5.0,"This product is ""paraben free"" which is important to me. The Cream absorbs much better than previous products used. Progesterone is good for so many things in a woman's body"
5813,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/1,5.0,"For anyone with difficulties, this tea is a life saver. It produces excellent results. It is best to follow instructions explicitly."
5814,Healthy Hoof Lacquer .5 Oz,0/0,5.0,It really works. My nails are stronger and longer than they they have ever been. It was a great buy.
5815,Summit Brands IO10N 152oz Super Iron Out,0/0,5.0,Moved to a place with the worst water I have seen. Unbelievable iron levels that literally turns yellow within a minute of coming out of the tap. This is good on toilets when they get stained with rust but was less effective on clothes that suffered the same fate. Didnt make them white again but a light yellow. This stuff is pretty nasty if you inhale any dust and there should be better warning labels to indicate this. I can imagine that someone will get seriously hurt with this product.
5816,"10"""" PADDLE BALL",0/0,1.0,Very cheap...saw later at dollar store. Would not recommend this to anyone. One of the rubber strings broke immediately. Not the quality i had as a child.
5817,Curious George Tin Kaleidoscope - only one included,0/0,5.0,"These kaleidoscopes, I think, will last much longer being made of tin. I bought them for my 3 year old twins who I hope will be fascinated with them (as much as I was then they arrived!). I received my item packaged very well, and quickly. I enjoy doing business on Amazon because I can always count on getting great service!"
5818,Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit,0/0,5.0,"With this kit all you need to do is provide the meat and veggies and you're making sushi. The well-written cookbook that comes with the kit is adequate to get you going; it has the most common recipes for various types of sushi, how to cut fish, how to prepare shrimp, basic sushi history, sushi bar etiquette, and more. The ingredients are first rate, and the included sushi vinegar (rice dressing) is delicious. The wasabi and ginger that come in the kit are both tasty as well. If you're not experienced at making finger sushi you can get a 5-piece plastic mold from Amazon for about $3, and I highly recommend you do so for professional looking sushi every time. Using the kit's bamboo mat for the first time I made a delicious and awesome looking inside-out eel roll that drew many compliments. I recommend using an in-depth sushi book (like Sushi for Dummies) in conjunction with this kit to learn all the ins and outs of sushi making; it'll make things a lot easier during the initial learning curve.Someone also mentioned it would be cheaper to assemble the various components included with the kit for much less money; having tried this I can say that isn't the case. Buying everything separately came out to be much more expensive, not to mention time consuming hunting everything down. This kit contains everything you need to hit the ground running and you can't beat the price considering the high quality of all the components. I highly recommend this Sushi Chef kit."
5819,Learning Resources Teaching Cash Register,0/1,5.0,"My son saw this in a catalogue, I found it Cheaper here on Amazon. He spent a huge chunk of Christmas playing with it, and we didn't even realize he didn't have batteries in it until the 3 days later. He loves it."
5820,"Karl Lagerfeld Sun, Moon & Stars EDT Perfume 30ml",0/0,5.0,I love Sun Moon Star perfume. I've worn nothing but this perfume since I was like 18! I was so happy to find it on Amazon since I can no longer find any reasonable prices locally. Why pay $60 at the Mall?I would describe the scent but I just don't think it's possible. Everyone loves this perfume. I've had to write down the name for other people more times than I can count.

5828,Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,0/0,4.0,"I use this stroller for my baby and 4yr old and it has proved invaluable. The only this is I wish it had more storage room, but I guess that would defeat the purpose of it not being bulky."
5829,Jeopardy,0/0,4.0,"The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the questions are hard to read through the plastic rack that holds the cards and we think the final jeopardy questions should be listed separately and not part of the general board questions. Otherwise, we love and will probably buy another one. This one was a Christmas gift to my daughter."
5830,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"We have two children and we used a regular fan in their rooms to create white noise. In the winter time their rooms would get cold and a fan was not practical, especially when they had colds. The Dohm just makes a soothing sound without the air circulation and the kids love it, we bought one for our room too. I would recommend this unit over a typical fan, love it!"
5831,Safari Guillotine Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"They are good to hold, easy to handle. Havent used them much but they are a good model and usuable."

5833,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"My 3 cats are pretty spoiled - so it is a high compliment to say that this little inexpensive toy is their favorite! It gets my 8 year old kitty going, and he will not even blink at other toys (balls, feather wands, laser toys). All three of my cats (1, 7 and 8) will chase this thing and jump for it.Stock up - this toy is fabulous!"
5834,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,The price was much better than Pet Smart or Petco for these. I give my dog a greenie each night before bed and am convinced they are the prime reason his teeth look so good and his breath is - well - I can't say it's minty fresh lol but it's NOT bad! Greenies are softer than most dog biscuits/treats which makes them good for older dogs as well.
5835,Melissa & Doug Classic ABC Block Cart,0/0,1.0,"Damage when it came, kids wasn't happy at all. Please Don't buy it at all its a waste of money."

5838,Jarrow Coconut Oil,0/0,5.0,"I've been using coconut oil for a while and have tried 2 different brands. This is the third brand I taste and so far, it's the best one. I made some veggie chips and they turned out so crisp and flavorful. Though the oil does not have a strong coconut flavor, it enhanced the flavor of the vegetables I cooked, they were so good. It makes great popcorn and gives salmon a delicious touch. I've also used it on my skin and face. It absorbs fairly quickly and leaves my skin so smooth. I really like it."
5839,Star Wars Power of the Force Green Card Greedo Action Figure,0/0,5.0,"As described, easy to locate. A mother of girls buying for nephews. Was a little apprehensive, having no clue. Perfect for the boys."
5840,"Conair Instant Heat Dual Voltage Flat Iron 2"" Ceramic Straightener",0/0,5.0,"Much more expensive straightners can be found, but this one meets my needs quite well. It heats quickly yet the exterior surface doesn't burn my hand. I like how it is slightly curved as well, so I can grab hair closer to my head more easily."
5841,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,"my grade school kid loved the product, really nice introduction to electronic, would defintiely recommend as intro to concepts of electricity"

5848,"Aurora Plush 12"" Mimi, Aurora Babies Toy Maltese",0/0,4.0,"this is such a cute, snuggly puppy. I'm sure it will be years of cuddly enjoyment to someone who can't have a real puppy"
5849,Ponaris Ponaris Nasal Emollient,0/0,5.0,A while back I suffered from frequent nosebleeds. I was treated by an ENT doctor with several cauterizations. She also wanted me to keep my nostrils moist at night. She suggested Ponaris. Well it helped me heal and I have used it every night since and have had no further problems with nosebleeds.Bottom line; doctor recomended and effective!
5850,Step 2 Up & Down Roller Coaster,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this roller coaster for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES it. She plays with it every day for at least a half hour. It is sturdy, safe, and fun. It does take up a lot of room but it is a good active toy that can be used inside, you just have to step over it if you have a small house like we do.Her friends all love it to.What I love about it is that she can do it all by herself with ease. She is able to push the car up the track, get on, and push off by herself. There have been no injuries and I dont forsee any - even with her riding it backwards. It is low enough to the ground that the I can see any real injuries happening.This is definitely worth the money we spent. You would think she would grow tired of it but she hasnt yet."
5851,Melissa & Doug 60-Piece Standard Unit Blocks,0/0,4.0,"This is a &#34;full size&#34; block set. The blocks are solid hardwood, well-cut to match sizes with rounded corners. Good variety of blocks. They only lose a star (should only half a star) because the set is unfinished - you'll probably want to either paint them in colors or put an oil finish on them, and they were not inexpensive to start with."
5852,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"If you just want some protein that is effective, choose this one. I love strawberry, it tastes great (i drink mine with low fat milk as opposed to water) and it definitely helps with your workout routine. I used it mainly for recovery not so much to help bulk."
5853,FootSmart Bunion Regulator,0/2,1.0,"This is the worst I ever tried. Do not buy it. The stick which is on the top hurts and creates bruises even when I sleep. I called Amazon for a refund. Unless you want some kind of entertainment and your life is boring, buy it first, get experience, and then call amazon for your refund. Or may be it will work for you!"
5854,Oral-B Sonic Complete Refill Toothbrush Heads,0/0,5.0,I was happy to find the brush heads becasue you no longer can buy them in the store. the product is good quality and the price was right.
5855,Sanitary Pooper Scooper,0/0,1.0,"The rakes bent after a couple of uses, then they fell off after a couple more uses, making the product completely useless. Also, I found it to be small. Definitely not a sturdy product. I would invest my money elsewhere."
5856,"Licorice Scottie Dogs, Black, 5-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,My niece loved them. she is a huge licorice fan and dog fan so the combination was just right for her.

5859,Kama Sutra Massage Oil 8 oz,0/0,5.0,I had went to a spa day and thought it would be good to use at home with my husband. It worked out wonderfully.
5860,Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver,0/0,3.0,The blade guards are a little rough on the skin and makes me hesitant to really use the trimmer without being very cautious. Often pulls hairs rather than clips them. With that said I'm not sure how many good alternative body trimmers there are.
5861,"Yogi Bedtime, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is my new go-to night time tea! I loved the lightly sweet taste and the calming affect it gives you after a few sips. I work in retail and my sleep is greatly affected by my shifts, so finding quality sleep is crucial. This tea has given me a healthy way of balancing sleep and relaxation. I have been drinking this tea for a few months now and plan on sticking with it. Thank you Yogi tea!!"
5862,Hasbro Operation,0/0,1.0,"amazon had listed the &#34;original&#34; operation for $29.99, which is what i ordered. i was sent the &#34;new&#34; version, the one made for small kids, that sold at mass merchants for $7.99. when i complained, hasbro &#34;generously&#34; offered to let me have this version (which i didn't want) for $15. crazy. fortunately, i was able to return this & get a full credit. what a bother though, and an extreme disappointment..."

5865,"Medline Overbed Table, Composite Top",0/0,4.0,"This has worked very well for a bedside table for our daughter's nurses to use for medications, charting, etc. Seems to be a nice sturdy table,"
5866,Neutrogena Instant Lip Remedy Lip Balms And Moisturizers,0/0,2.0,"Love the scent of this! But it's really sticky. I can't use it. When I talk, it doesn't feel natural...my lips stick together. So disappointed."
5867,Arctic Paws 2-1/2-Pound Yummy Chummies Original Bulk treats,1/1,5.0,These are the best treats you can feed your pets. I found these at least 15 years ago(or more). Since I had a Scottish Terrier alergic to EVERYTHING. She loved these and so has every dog since her. You couldn't ask for better.
5868,Cardinal Laboratories E-Collar,0/0,3.0,My Daughter is a groomer and I bought these to keep her safe. The large one may fit a small to medium dog but length wize lacks for keeping the dogs mouth from being a problem snapping and biting around it.
5869,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"I love this seat if you cant tell. My daughter got to the point she hated sitting in her high chair so I started researching other options and this was what I went with after purchasing a cheaper, both in price and design, one earlier. Whats nice about this one is the dual trays and the tray cover for when we travel with it. I also love the adjustable heights and how securely it attaches to a chair. We went on vacation earlier before we bought this and it was a nightmare trying to feed our child. I can not wait to take it with us on vacation this year."
5870,Gretel Red Dachshund,0/0,2.0,"I had a very disappointed 4 yr old Xmas morning. This dog does not look like a dachshund nor is it 12 inches from paw to paw! 8 inches max! When she opened it her comment was ""I wanted a long dachshund"". Will not be ordering Xmas presents anymore from Amazon or anywhere else! Sorry!"
5871,Lovely Eau de Parfum for Women by Sarah Jessica Parker,1/1,5.0,This was a Christmas gift and it arrived safe and sound and on time. My wife was delighted. She has used this fragrance before so we knew she would like it.

5874,Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,0/0,5.0,"Life saver! The baby room doesn't smell, it's easy to operate, the refill bags are cheap enough and it's the perfect size."
5875,Rattlesnake Eggs,1/1,5.0,"I'm 64 -- this year -- and had one of these whenIwas a kid.What you do is, very carefully, wind up the mechanism --[it's a machined washer on a rubberband]. Put it verycarefully back in the envelope, and put it where the""victim"" will SEE it.The victim reads the envelope and -- like Pandora's Box --think to themselves ""Yeah.. Right! Rattlesnake eggs? Ha!""Okay, now they have taken the bait.Since you --carefully-- put the envelope down, the victimonly has to barely touch the envelope, and it goes a rattlin'!This noise will make him scream like a little girl. If you are inluck and they have been drinking too much TEA or COFFEE,you just m-i-g-h-t get a different reaction altogether.Have a mop bucket at hand!Good luck... and Happy New Year!"
5876,"Tek Nek ""Legend"" Spring Horse",0/0,5.0,"Bought this horse in July 2012 for my nephew when he was about 1 1/2. He loved it then and still loves it. He's huge for his age, most people don't believe me when I tell them how old he is. He rides, bounces on, rocks on this horse as hard as he can and it just keeps going. I was little worried about the buttons that make the noises and music (music in his right ear, running sound in left) but they seem to be holding up just fine so far even with my nephew completely wrenching the ears to find those buttons.Still his favorite toy and a great way to give his mom a break. I was a little shocked when I saw the price of these types of horses, but boy was it worth it."
5877,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,0/0,3.0,"As I only purchased this near the end of the season, I really can't tell how good it is. In spring of 2013 I will have a better idea."
5878,"Lixit Glass Water Bottle, 32-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I've purchased four of these over the last ten years for my Greenwinged and Harlequin Macaws. they work great, are easy to clean, and are spacious enough to keep them watered for a week. The glass, rubber, and stainless steel construction allows me to add apple cider vinegar to the water for their health without concern for how the mild acid will react with the dispenser.The only downside for us is that the Macaws, especially the Harlequin, are quite good at flipping up the wire retainer and dumping the bottle, when they are outside of the cage, so we devised a PVC cover to prevent that."
5879,"Dimensions Paint By Number Kit (20"" X 16"") - in your choice of designs",0/0,5.0,I bought it for my friend. She loves it. She said that it's pretty easy to make it but be ready to spend pretty long time to finish it.
5880,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap,3/3,5.0,"I bought this wrap for my 15-lb Bichon Frise as a last resort before crating. He's 7 years old, and is house broken, but developed separation anxiety after I went back to work in March and started marking all over our furniture and making our home smell like urine. We tried the sprays and everything else and he continued to do this. Everyone kept telling us to crate him during the day but I really didn't want to do that because he's never had to be in a crate and I knew it would upset him a lot. I saw this wrap on Amazon when I was researching doggy diapers, and thought I'd give it a try. I read the reviews, some of which said to put a maxi pad in the wrap before putting it on the dog so I bought a jumbo pack with wings and change it out a couple of times a day. I bought an additional wrap so I can alternate them when washing one (2-3 times a week). The maxi pads do bunch up sometimes, so the wrap will get urine on it, but it doesn't leak out of the wrap (I just need to wash the wrap then). This wrap did not stop his marking (he still does it), but now it's contained and our house smells nice again! I've recommended this to others!"
5881,Alex Toys Paper Roll (18X75') White,0/0,4.0,Nice high quality paper! Fit perfectly and is great and durable for a 2.5 year old to pull out on her own!

5884,OXO SteeL Soap Dispensing Dish Brush,2/3,1.0,"I ignored the negative reviews like I usually do. Don't be fooled by the shininess. THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP!!! Instead of making the handle like a well, it is two halves (poorly) stuck together. I now have to put glue on the bottom to prevent leakage. I shouldn't have to fix something I just bought. You couldn't give me this product for free. Don't ignore the negative reviews like I did."
5885,Culturelle Culturelle Probiotic,0/0,5.0,"The nurse at my Doctor's office recommended this for my caffeine induced burning, clenching stomach. I have found that after the first month this helps my stomach and also helps regulate my system. Don't know if it's psychological or not, don't care cause it's working for me!"
5886,"Swiffer WetJet Spray, Mop Floor Cleaner Starter Kit (Packaging May Vary)",0/0,5.0,"I finally disposed of my old mop and purchased the Swiffer WetJet mop. It comes with a starter kit of liquid floor cleaner and a package of mop pads, plus the plastic scrapper attachment. Work like a charm!"

I have to supervise him though, as he will tear up and destroy the squirrels to get at the squeeker. We put it away when he starts to chew on the fabric. He is so cute and smiles when he plays with this toy."
5889,"Premier Citronella Refill for Anti Bark Collar, 3-ounces",0/0,3.0,"Not certain if this really works. At times it does seem to work properly and then other times it does not. Might depend on pitch of bark, etc. Still on the fence about this product"
5890,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"This is a great bed, and both of our dogs love them (we have two border collies). The top is soft and the bottom is a linen.

5896,"Melissa & Doug Shape, Model and Mold",1/3,1.0,"I had always heard Melissa & Doug toys were made in the USA, so when I saw them on sale, thought I'd buy some for my grandchild...Didn't know they are made in China now... with all the problems with dead dogs & cats from bad food/treats, with lead in paint used in toys and drywall/sheet rock problems from China (besides why help support China)... had I known, I'd have never bought them... didn't know until the presents were opened so I can't return them...They burned well in the fireplace (hope the smoke I didn't kill any birds flying overhead)Will never buy another toy from this company"

5900,"Yummy Earth Organic Candy, 5 Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"My wife has a combination of conditions that severely restrict her diet (IC compounded with abdominal CRPS/RSD). Just the food coloring in a cold tablet has sent her to the hospital via ambulance. Trying to find something for her sweet tooth has been a nightmare, since she reacts to most artificial colors and until now, all citric acid. Evidently the beet-based citric acid is different enough from corn-based that she can have these. She's tried every flavor, and not one hurts her (with her reactions to red dyes, we have come to view anything red as a potential personal IED for her... and you wouldn't believe where red dye is found that makes no sense (did you know Twinkies were made with red 40?).And seeing how she committed to quitting smoking yesterday, these lollipops in their huge bag are GOLD. Thanks, YummyEarth!"

[I only clicked one star because there wasn't a no-stars or minus-one star available...]! I called to leave a message; and am waiting to hear from customer service...will update if/when they call me back. One week later-no callback...I'll bet they have gotten plenty complaints. I'll call back Monday[and Tues.,and Weds., etc.; and report back! After at least three weeks of calling, waiting for a callback, and leaving messages; I haven't heard a word. I'd bet that they have heard these complaints ALOT...and can't be bothered. How rude...'Jenny' is the CSR who was, hopefully, supposed to call back...or not! Amazon-I hope you no longer carry these 'products' out of concern for people who actually think they are buying edible snack [while only wasting money].

Then I found Philips 3 head shavers, and the last 30 years, every few years I was upgrading to what is the latest best. I had this one few years now. Shave is great, battery charge lasts forever, and I could not ask for a better product. Like everything else, this shaver will eventually need a replacement, and there is no doubt in my mind what brand I will buy."

5921,ROADMAX Excavator,0/0,5.0,"Finally some trucks/tractors/construction vehicles that function and are perfect for toddlers! We own several pieces from the Bruder ROADMAX collection and love them all. They have the right combination of tough/rugged construction with enough detail/functionality to keep toddlers interested and coming back for more. Front blade moves up and down (with notches that hold it in the position of choice), top portion spins, bucket arm moves nicely but notches hold it in elevated position if desired, and cab opens to hold driver (not included, but our Playmobil 123 people fit perfectly). Highly recommend for 2+ years."
5922,Earth Solutions Aromatherapy Scent Inhaler,1/2,3.0,"I can't attest to it's effectiveness for appetite control but the scent is nice. I just started using it, so the final outcome is TBD."
5923,"Karl Lagerfeld Sun, Moon & Stars EDT Perfume 30ml",0/0,1.0,"After reading all the feedback on this perfume I decided to give it a try. Am terribly disappointed in it, when I first spray it on you can smell it for about 5 minutes then nothing. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me at all. I do not feel the scent stays with you. I would not recommend to anyone."
5924,EAS Myoplex Lite Nutrition Shake,0/0,5.0,"I ordered myoplex for the extra vit and min. This stuff is pretty good, but it gets kind of think once you mix it in with water. Also the sodium is a little on the high side as well."
5925,Chocmod Truffettes de France Natural Truffles 2.2 lbs,0/0,5.0,These truffles were to die for - loved the dark chocolate. Great price for this quality chocolate. Will purchase again.
5926,Conair BM20XBC 2-in-1 Hot Air Styling Brush,0/0,3.0,"This brush is terrific for the hair but the durability is extremely poor lately. I have been using this brush for years and the first one I bought lasted for several years. Now they give out and stop working in less than a year. The last one I bought in May, 2012 and it has already stopped working. Since it is guaranted for a year, I am returning it for a replacementt."
5927,Melissa & Doug Geometric Stacker,0/0,1.0,"Damage when it came, kids wasn't happy at all. Please Don't buy it at all its a waste of money."
5928,Bedside Commode Toilet Seat Chair Frame - 9630,0/0,5.0,"This is the best possible commode for the money. It's big enough, I weigh around 260, it's sturdy enough, and comes all put together in the box. Truly, you don't have to shop any further. This is the one. The price is fantastically inexpensive for what the product is."
5929,"iOSAT Potassium Iodide Tablets, 130 mg (14 Tablets)",1/1,5.0,"I was happy to see that the expiration date was a generaous 2019---and I am sure that they will still be good for some time after. The item arrived in good time, and was as stated."
5930,Revlon Fire & Ice 1.7 oz. Cologne Spray,0/0,5.0,My wife's favorite fragrance and my favorite on her. She is irresistible as is but when she's wearing this I just melt. You couldn't pry her away from me with a crowbar!

No longer am I that woman getting pulled along by her 70 pound dog- she walks at my side confident and it makes me a happy dog mom.I will tell you my Weimaraner was a puller and jumper and to have that under control in just a few hours of wearing the collar- it's a life and back saver!
5939,Philosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer,0/0,5.0,I have always loved the fresh smell off philosophy. It is so clean ans refreshing. The moisturizer leaves my face so smooth and soft. It works so well under makeup and looks so smooth.

5941,Very Sexy 2 Perfume by Victoria's Secret for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,I have been looking for this perfume for so long!The smell is just amazing. Hands down best perfume ever. :)
5942,Candy Land - The Kingdom of Sweets Board Game,0/0,3.0,"This board, along with our copy of Chutes and Ladders, is really difficult to play. Our son is a typical 4 year old but he has a hard time staying focused when we play this game. There is way too much stimulus from the bright pictures that fill up the entire board. The spaces are too close together and the gingerbread men don't fit. I hope I can find an older version of the game because while I love the concept of Candyland, this one is just too hard for us to play."
5943,"Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Mango, 30 - 0.5-Ounce Bars Per Box",0/0,5.0,These are so good and my kids love them! A great snack for anyone and really good for a take along snack!
5944,Oster Blade Lube Premium Lubricating Oil for Clippers and Blades Hair Clippers Trimmers And Groomers,0/0,5.0,I have had three dogs with the same clippers. I oil the blades to make the clippers run smoother. I like the Lucky Dog Clippers a lot and it does a good job on my dog. I oil it all the time for a great smooth job.
5945,"OEM 25181 Razor Blades, 100 Pack",1/1,4.0,"These blades start out very sharp, but they don't hold their edge very long. I use them to cut cardboard boxes and build displays, and I have to change these blades very frequently in comparison to some other razors I've used in the past. With that being said, I gave them 4 stars for the value. At this price, I don't mind changing them more often. I also like the individual cardboard sleeves that wrap each blade."
5946,"Chris Christensen - ICE ON ICE Detangler and Finishing Spray, ready to use 16oz.",0/0,4.0,"I use it on a shorthair show cat and it gives a nice shine and texture. Smells good, too. Recommended."
5947,Butt Face Soap,0/0,5.0,Went over well at our Christmas party when we exchanged gifts. Anyone wanting a unique gift I would recommend buying this.
5948,"Opossum Cuddlekin 12"" by Wild Republic",0/0,5.0,Perfect gift the ten year old of the house. Step sister was getting a baby doll for christmas sooo the boy got a possum with a diaper on! This animal is perfect size for snuggling and very funny to look at!
5949,Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil,0/0,5.0,"I used this during my second pregnancy and got zero stretch marks. It smells nice and isn't super greasy. I enjoyed using it, and a little goes a long way."
5950,Bachmann Trains 14 PC. E-Z TRACK Graduated Pier Set,0/0,5.0,Does just what it is supports to. You track to new heights trains pass below it with no trouble. Easy to assemble.
5951,Couvre Alopecia Masking Lotion - 1.25 oz - Dark Brown,0/0,5.0,"Great product, which does a good job of hiding thinning area. I have used this product for about a year and plan to continue using it as long as it is practical."
5952,"Alphabet, Numbers & Animals Playmat - Covers 40 sq ft",0/0,1.0,"first of all it says alphabet, numbers & Animals playmat, it has no animals and was missing two letters.second of all it says covers 40 sq ft, but when it came the package clearly says covers 36 sq ft.very upset and disappointed with this product. I previously purchased two of these last year this one is nothing like the other two, they have full alphabet, 0-9 numbers 4 animals and border. It was a thicker mat too, and same brand."
5953,Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,0/0,4.0,"If you want to purchase a mobile that will entertain, stimulate and teach your child (rather than something that matches your nursery decor), buy this mobile. My infant has loved this from day one and cannot get enough of the pictures. As my son co-sleeps with us, I started by attaching the mobile to his changing table. I even took some of the extra cards and would place them around him while he was awake to give him something to look at. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could be constructed a bit better. The cards are difficult to disassemble and could probably be made better. However, this is a product that is only meant to be used for a short period of time and it serves it's purpose well. Do your child a favor and skip the cutesy animal mobile...buy this instead!"
5954,Pycnogenol 100mg 30 Caps,0/0,5.0,"The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."
5955,Treat Dispensing Chew Ball,0/0,5.0,"My 102 pound German Shepherd cherishes this chew ball. It is his constant companion and favorite toy. He enjoys the comfort of having it in his mouth, almost like a pacifier. He eagerly brings it to us and wants us to throw it for him to catch. He keeps it under surveillance and only humans that he totally trusts are allowed to touch it. It is rugged and resilient and has maintained pristine condition after months of enjoyment."
5956,Care Bears,0/0,5.0,was a great gift that nobody could find. the little girl it was for was very happy and her mother was shocked.
5957,OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack,0/0,5.0,"I use these for wet diapers, I can't get myself to rinse out the poop so I only use these for after wiping with disposable wipes, with a water/vinegar mixture. Or I use them to pat dry the baby's bottom skin to help prevent diaper rash. I want more of these!"
5958,Beleduc Your Body - Girl 5- Layer Wooden Puzzle,0/0,4.0,"Just got this puzzle today for my very curious 3 year old daughter. She LOVES it. I do too, my only complaints are1. Nothing is labeled.2. The mouth has no detail, just weird pink and purple stripes. I don't know why they didn't just draw a tongue.3. It's not in order, in my non-professional opinion I would have much rather seen the organs at the bottom, then skeleton, muscles, exc..... So I would be able to better explain to her that her ribs are over her heart and lungs to protect them and her skull is there to protect her brain. But ehh...It is a good size. It's tall and slender the pieces are also a good size so if one is dropped it is findable.So in conclusion if you are looking for a puzzle that is educational themed this is a good buy, if you are looking for something actually educational I recommend getting one of those 3D model kits you see in doctors offices in my non-professional opinion."
5959,The Laser Game,0/0,5.0,May grandson loved this game. He learned to play it quickly and is fun for children his age as well as parents and grandparents.
5960,"NOW Foods Progesterone Cream W/Lavender, 3 Ounces",0/0,5.0,It has a great natural fragrance and has the appropriate amount of progesterone. Portion controlled. Price is right. I will definitely buy it again.
5961,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"This is the second pair of trimmers I have purchased. The first pair was about the same price but sucked! It cut the nail too rough and seemed to hurt my dog :( These are the opposite. They give a clean, quick cut and then I use a black nail file to round them out a little. Great price! & GREAT PRODUCT!"
5962,"Duro-Med Flannel/Rubber Waterproof Sheeting, White",1/1,3.0,This sheeting is fine but I really meant to order the rubber sheeting that is backed on BOTH sides with flannel. The flannel makes it much more comfortable.
5963,Nylabone Galileo Bone Dog Chew Toy,0/0,5.0,"I have two dogs, an 80 pounder and a 25 pounder. Both are strong chewers, the small one has gone through wire fencing. I bought two of these in 2005. They got down to about an 1/8 of their original size in the last 7 years, so I am buying two more.Almost no other dog toys last a day. Some last a week or a month. These last for AGES. Even better, as they break down only tiny, rice-sized pieces come off that the dogs swallow and pass. A large chuck has never come off, so these are also safe unsupervised 24/7 toys.Love them."
5964,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,1/1,5.0,"I haven't had this that long, but so far i enjoy it.This is essentially clippers, the same one you may get your hair cut with at a barber shop or hair salon. The extra feature is the adjustable length you can set it to. You simply roll the dial on the side of this device and it adjusts the measurement device at the end and you go to town.It's all pretty easy and convenient. It advertises that it auto sharpens and you don't need to oil it, which is great because I hate doing that stuff for something like this.If you want to keep your facial hair a certain length, this is absolutely a great start especially for the price.I haven't had any battery issues yet, but if i do I will surely update my review."

5967,Mirror* Hand* Large* Black,0/0,4.0,"This mirror does its job. It is a bit flimsy but it is sturdy enough, especially for the price. I have not dropped it yet so I cannot tell you how it holds up to trauma. I use it to cut my own hair. Messed it up last time and had to shave my head. This was no fault of the mirror. I told everyone at work my wife messed my hair up so things worked out."
5968,Earth Therapeutics Footsie Foot Massager,0/0,5.0,"My son specifically asked me for this product, so when I saw it advertised in a Yoga magazine, I immediately ordered it. Not just for my son but for my daughter and her boyfriend. I even ordered one for myself and take it to work. It makes your tired feet feel brand new, and the principles of reflexology come to life. It is compact and easy to bring everywhere. I highly recommend this product for any hardworking, on your feet a lot person."

5970,Vietnamese coffee filter set,0/0,3.0,"The container is small, and also, its screw-on axis is short, so you cannot make a lot of coffee with it. If you just want to make a small cup then it is fine."

5974,Natures Gate Organic Fruit Therapy Deodorants,0/0,5.0,"I got this because the price was good, the reviews were good and I wanted to have a small stash of natural deoderants. I haven't used it yet but I have to say it smells awesome! A person could use this as a light cologne (I think it's a smell that women would really like.)"
5975,Alex Toys My First Sewing Kit,0/0,5.0,I would recommend this toy . My granddaughter is 6 years old and loves it. She sewed of the animal cut out the very day I gave her the kit. Has plenty of projects.

5979,"One Pack of Shocking Gum, Funny Shock Gag (Random Color)",1/1,1.0,I purchased these as stocking stuffers. Some had a mild electric charge while others were freakishly strong. I made sure I wasn't standing in water when they were around. They went in the trash.
5980,"Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren for Men, Eau De Toilette Natural Spray",0/0,5.0,Started &#34;wearing&#34; this fragrance in the 80s when it was introduced. I have had a consistent feeling about it and did NOT wear it only when I had difficulty finding it offered by many stores. It seems to me that the newer Polo fragrances are nowhere as good. Glad I found a place to get it.
5981,Peter Thomas Roth Sulfur Cooling Masque,0/0,3.0,"As different kinds of ance caused by different reasons, no drugs or anything else could be useful for every people. It could make face feel cool, but seems not work for me."
5982,Energizer Max Alkaline Batteries,0/0,5.0,"After my husband passed away recently, I noticed that I had no extra batteries and I needed to restock. I obtained these along with 2 other sizes, and I'm very happy with what I received."
5983,Reusable/Washable waterproof bed pad,0/1,3.0,"We use these as pet pee pads. We've used them a few times now and unfortunately they let moisture through to the bottom, so the floor underneath is damp. This seems to happen if the urination is near the edge, so that it leaks out of the seams; can't be sure about this though. When the urination is in the center, this happens less often or not at all. Disappointing."
5984,Eclectic Institute Inc Black Raspberry,0/0,5.0,"This product is great. Good antioxidant and you need to use on a daily basis. If you don't get much fruit in you diet, this is for you."
5985,POSTURE-PRO Adjustable Double Diner,0/0,3.0,"I ordered two of these for my dogs - we have a newfoundland and a mastiff. One of them came with three missing screws on one leg (where the leg is attached to the top) - and when I found the screws loose in the box and attempted to screw them in myself, I discovered that the screws were stripped. Which is probably why they fell out. I was able to replace with three slightly larger screws of my own, but the legs on both are still pretty wobbly when fully extended. The previous reviews I read said that this product was very sturdy, so I don't know if mine was poorly put together.We're going to attempt to stabilize and made them less wobbly, because the price is really good, and these are the perfect height for my dogs. The bowls are good quality, and the top wood piece feels very well-made.Edited to change star rating"
5986,The Original Tube Reader,0/0,5.0,"Perfect for what I need. No little nose pieces braking apart. It just seats nicely and it stays on. Plus, it looks great. I recommend it!"

5988,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,"This toy is amazing for any child beginning to walk. I first saw this toy in person and saw how engaged the child was with it and how well it worked. When I was looking for a gift for another child, I knew I wanted to see if I could get it. I was surprised by how inexpensive it was. After seeing it in person, I thought it would cost much more. You're really getting a good value for your money with this one!"
5989,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,5.0,I got a great deal on this set at Christmas for my 6-year-old son paying only $200! My son absolutely loves it! My step father has the same one so I knew the quality was excellent! My sister got my some extra track as a Christmas gift making this the best toy to beat! I couldn't be happier!

5993,Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Wet/Dry Straightening Iron,0/0,4.0,Wonderful to work with. Great for all hair types as it will adjust to your desired level of heat. Non damaging and effective. I ordered for a cousin and she loves it. I have been using it for over a year now. Grab it while it's available as other stores seem to have let it go from their inventory. It probably kept their competitors from selling! Love it.

5995,Forum Novelties 63503 Amazing Gag Shock Lighter,0/0,2.0,Shockingly awful quality. Very thin and delicate. In no way does it feel or look like a lighter. Not fun.
5996,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,4.0,"While the pen is perfect for my Chihuahua Yorkie mix there is one real problem...he CAN jump over it! While at work I put him in this before I leave in the morning so I don't have to lock him in some small ridiculous carrier and he has ample room to play, eat, sleep and there is even room for his PetZoom Pet Park Deluxe 3-Piece Dog Relief System to use. I even bought the 2 additional panels to fit all the amenities he needed to feel &#34;free&#34;. And no, I do not put anything tall inside for him to be able to jump on and over the pen.But alas...I come home every day to find him out of the pen &#34;sigh&#34;. Well I guess I'm going to have to build a custom cover but other than that this pen is so simple and quick to put together, looks oh so cute, and the door is just adorable! It's even quick to take apart and take with you to the beach, in-laws, you name it. Wish they made it in black or dark blue though."
5997,Melissa & Doug Maggie Leigh Magnetic Dress-Up,0/0,5.0,My little niece (almost 3 years old) really enjoys Maggie Leigh. She matches the outfits and coordinates the shoes.

6003,DKNY BE DELICIOUS For Men By DONNA KARAN Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,1.0,"Looks like DKNY be delicious for men but it is completely fake it smells like they put this horrible, old man cheap cologne scent in a be delicious bottle. I just wasted $50."
6004,Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc),0/0,3.0,"Thought this would be a little a bit better in quality. Several of the &#34;heads&#34; to the screws were off, easily fixed. A little small in size."

6006,OTC ORTHOTEX Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Hinged Bars,0/0,5.0,"For me this product has helped quite a bit. Some reviewers wrote they had trouble with it slipping, but I found that if you really tighten the bottom strap, it works fine. My leg is thicker than the one shown in the picture and it fits with no problem."
6007,"Snoozer Lookout I Pet Car Seat, Small, Highland Maize",0/0,5.0,"A friend had a similar car seat for her little rat terrier and even though our small cocker spaniel was securely seat belted in the back seat she couldn't see out and would hang her head like she was going to be car sick. We ordered this car seat, which are promptly and in perfect condition. Easy to assemble. And now Bella LOVES to go for rides. She's up high so she can see out but still firmly seat-belted in. We positioned the seat in the middle of the back seat so she can see out in front and on the sides, and if we open the sunroof she sniffs the air coming in. She's always thrilled to go for a ride now. Such a joy seeing her happy. And the good news is that the cover slips off easily and machine washes & dries without shrinkage."
6008,"Priva Waterproof Mealtime Protector, Blue Terry",0/0,5.0,I bought this for a friend that has Parkinsons and it works great--yes someone might have to snap it on for him but still something I would buy again.
6009,Topricin Topricin Cream,0/0,4.0,"A doctor recommended this cream to me for muscle pain. It works great as well as being fragrance free, and non-greasy. I don't have to worry about it rubbing off onto my clothing. I just wish it was less expensive, it's hard to find in stores in my area."

6012,"Sculpey III Polymer Clay Color Sampler, Multicolor",0/0,5.0,We bought this so that we could get an idea of what the colours actually looked like. We intend to use it as a buying guide for any future purchases. It is also very handy for when you only need a little pinch of a colour for some detailing. Saves you having to buy a whole block.
6013,Bvlgari White By Bvlgari For Men and Women. Eau De Cologne Spray 2.5 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"This is the best perfume so far. It is light, fresh, and can be used for every occasion. It took me several years to find my &#34;signature perfume&#34; and this is it. There is nothing like it. I have never received so many compliments about my perfume than with this one. Without even asking, people I don;t even know come up to me and comment on it. It is that great!!!!"
6014,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,4.0,"my two dogs, both loved it but the bed itself was too large for the area I had thought out in putting their bed so I had to return it, which was a hassle with UPS and amazon. but after many attempts it was solved and money was refunded 100%."
6015,"Vitamin E Skin Oil Squalene, 90 Softgels",2/2,2.0,"Wouldn't purchase this brand again. Many other ingredients besides just the E oil. it's very thin and watery, too. I'm used to thick vitamin e oil."
6016,Nutricology/ Allergy Research Group Ox Bile,0/0,4.0,This product has assisted me since my gall bladder removal. I received this product quickly and it works well. Highly Recommended.
6017,"Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie Chocolate Chunk, Vegan, 3-Ounce Individually Wrapped Cookies (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,These Vegan cookies were an unexpected find on Amazon's site; I received the freshly-baked bag of cookies that came with instructions to freeze them to keep them fresh. There are large chunks of dark chocolate and it is a delicious cookie. I will order these to have on hand so I can enjoy an occasional treat while sticking to my plant-based vegan diet.
6018,"Truform 20-30 Mens Thigh High, XL, Black",0/0,5.0,These compression thigh high socks are really good. They help with muscle soreness by increasing blood flow to your legs. I am glad l found them for a reasonable price on Amazon.com
6019,Elite 1-Inch Cylinder Air Stone,0/0,5.0,"This is a great. Product,it's small enough to hide in a statue or under gravel or you can leave it visible and enjoy watching the bubbles. The fish love this as they will swim down stream towards to. The air bubbles that this stone makes. Great price very happy with purchase!"
6020,Lupine Designer Combo Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,We've had several Lupine dog products and this like previous is very good quality. This particular colar doesn't snap together it slips over the dogs head and then has a loop for shoker like capability.Lupine has replaced worn leasshes for us a couple of times now so we decided to try the colars also. Good stuff so far. We're very pleased.
6021,KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,0/0,5.0,"bought this for my 9 month old son. we have gotten him a bunch of bath boys and needed something for him to learn to put away after baths, we also have a basket but this is an easier access for him when sitting inside the tub. its durable to a certain amount of weight and can be easily cleaned. no complaints whatsoever! highly recommend!"
6022,Organic White Silver Needle Tea - Bai Hao Yinzhen,0/0,5.0,tea smells really niceand in my opinion is better than green tea.i dont remember how long it took to ship.
6023,Wise and Otherwise,0/0,4.0,Have not had an occasion to give it a good try as it seems to be more fun with a number ofpeople involved. It is beautifully crafted. In future I am sure we will get lots of enjoymentas it was highly recommended.
6024,"Polo by Ralph Lauren for Men, Eau De Toilette Natural Pour",0/0,5.0,Started &#34;wearing&#34; this fragrance in the 80s when it was introduced. I have had a consistent feeling about it and did NOT wear it only when I had difficulty finding it offered by many stores. It seems to me that the newer Polo fragrances are nowhere as good. Glad I found a place to get it.
6025,"Cadet 1-Pound Bully Sticks for Dogs, 4 to 6-Inch",0/0,4.0,my pup likes these but they get bored with them. i have to hide them for a while and take them out again
6026,kai Body Buffer,0/0,5.0,"I love the way my skin feels and smells, very fresh!!! I put one in all my showers, guests love the special touch!"
6027,LE MALE,1/1,2.0,The spray valve arrived off the bottle and is damaged. This will probably prevent me from using what product is left. I would recommend one buy this product from a brick and morar store...not online.
6028,Razbaby RaZberry Teether,0/0,5.0,My 9-month old was chewing all of his pacifiers and I got this to prevent him from tearing all of them up - great product!
6029,Vicks Vicks Vapo Steam Liquid Medication For Hot Vaporizers Cough Suppressant,1/1,4.0,"$13 might seem like a lot of money for a bottle of cold medication but it's really difficult to put a price on good nights sleep!I was a little put off by the price of Vicks VapoSteam but I didn't realize how long this stuff will last. This bottle, for my Vicks humidifier, will definitely last the entire winter season, so the price isn't so much when you think about it that way.I worried that the smell might be too strong or even irritating but it doesn't overwhelm at all, it's actually quite comforting as it just sort of lofts around my bedroom.I don't use it only when I have a cold but when my head or nasal passages are just stuffed up from daily allergies (my cats!:) or the dry, discomforting winter air that's so irritating to my nose. About 10 minutes after the humidifier is turned on, my breathing is so much easier and pleasant, I really appreciate this stuff."
6030,Duro-Med Deluxe Autoclavable Bedpan,0/0,2.0,"my mom uses this bedpan and it is literally a pain in the a$$$$, she has no choice to use but to use it since she cannot use her commode by her beside yet.."
6031,North States Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate,0/0,1.0,"I purchased this gate to block my dog out of the area where the cats are and it is total garbage. The ""locking system"" does not lock, it has to fit into one of their spacing, the pressure pieces on the side do not stick out far enough to actually brace against the wall. I tried for about an hour to install this and finally threw it in the trash. I have never written a review before but I have also never been this disappointed with a purchase."
6032,"Annie's Homegrown Cheddar Bunnies Baked Crackers, 1-Ounce Snack Packs in 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,1.0,We only received one box of the 6 boxes of 6 1-oz snack packs and were charged $18.31. Very poor service.
6033,"Nature's Answer - Valerian Root Alcohol Free, 1000 mg, 2 oz",0/0,4.0,"I put a few drops of this in some chamomile tea and honey at night, read a bookand I fall right to sleep. Seems to work well. It does have a funky smellbut that's valerian. It dissipates."
6034,"Paddington Bear 10""",0/0,5.0,"Wonderful detail, can stand on his own. Little paw pads under his boots even and black ears under his hat- real toggle coat- all felt cut out but very thick. This is very well made in my opinion."
6035,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",1/1,5.0,My two year old loves this. He is learning with it and wakes up in the morning ready to play it everyday.
6036,Sunsout The Last Supper 500 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"It is super. Person I purchased it for loves it. Challenging but not overwhelming; however, not recommended for younger age groups (less than 12 yrs old)"
6037,Fridge Words Magnetic Word Builder,0/0,4.0,"My kid seems to like it a lot and we have had it for 4+ months and he goes back to it quite a bit, Definitely peaked his interest in spelling. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was but when he is happy, I am happy. And the fact that he still plays with it is good thing. Sometimes the letters are read incorrectly by the machine but that could be from abuse from the kid or god only knows what kind of dirt or grim gets in those things from sliding all over the floor."
6038,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Orbee,0/1,2.0,"I ordered the tuff orbee ball which I have for my other dog, and she absolutely loves it! Lasts forever! Unfortunately, I received the SOL ball instead. Not as good as the orbee (the one with the map on it), not as durable and much softer. Since I wasn't home when I received the package, the ball was given to my dog and he didn't have it for 1 hour before he slit it. Won't be able to return, obviously. Guess I'll have to leave strict instructions for when i'm not home.If you want a ball that lasts with aggressive chewing, I highly recommend the tuff orbee ball, not the SOL."
6039,"Mens Designer Cologne By Giorgio Armani, ( Black Code EAU De Toilette Spray 2.5oz)",0/0,5.0,This is a manly scent that women seem to love. Subtle but sophisticated. You can't go wrong having this in your collection.

6042,Melissa & Doug Wooden Family Doll Set,0/0,4.0,This is a nice doll set. It fit the doll house perfectly and the kids love having the whole family. The only critique is that the dolls are a bit stiff. They can't stand and they don't sit in chairs very well. Still a very fun and imaginitive toy though.
6043,Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets,0/0,5.0,"My Lab has hip problems and taking Dasuquin has helped her tremendously, she also like the taste.Daisy says, &#34;They're GREAT!&#34;"

6046,"SportDOG WetlandHunter 400 Yard Remote Trainer, SD-400CAMO",0/0,5.0,"This works awesome. I bought it for my bluetick and began using it for her about 5-6 months of age. Did not take long at all. I rarely ever have to actually shock her unless she's hunting. Other than that, a simple BEEP and she's running straight back. Holds a long charge and works at great distances. Will go beyond 400 yards depending on the terrain"
6047,"Revlon RV408 1875 Watt Full-Size Turbo Dryer, Black",0/0,5.0,"I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty."
6048,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,This stuff was great for a post-workout shake after my morning run. It's helping me get in shape before basic. Chocolate Milkshake is my favorite so far. Ps- Use skim milk- it tastes better:)

6050,Marina Decorative Gravel - 1 lbs,0/0,2.0,"At time of purchase, I did not know the rule of thumb, that you need one pound of gravel per gallon of tank. So, when I realized I was still four pounds short, I bought more from petsmart. There, I paid less for four pounds than I did here for one. I had no idea that there were such differences..."
6051,Nilodor Tap A Drop Original,0/0,5.0,"The original &#34;Tap-A-Drop&#34; is still the best odor neutralizer that I have found in my 61 years. I have a new dog, and therefore have new odors to clean up. This works!"
6052,Sergeant's Vetscription 3.2-Ounce Hairball Remedy Cat,1/1,5.0,My cats like this and it's a nice formulation - not too thick and not runny like some other brands. Thank you!
6053,"Kyjen Puzzle Plush Egg Babies Dog Toy, Fish, 5 Eggs",1/1,5.0,"Got this for my brothers dog at Christmas, with a room full of family, the people were as entertained by this learning toy as the dog was! He unwrapped it himself and watched as he was shown where the eggs were. Definitely a supervised game only, but he really tried to figure it out. Ate the feet off in a few minutes, but body still intact and eggs still working."
6054,Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support,0/0,5.0,"The Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support was very inexpensive, and exactly what it looks like. Just what I wanted and needed, pretty fair quality. I could see how continually removing and adding it to a chair may weaken some of the seams, but for a support that stays in one place, on one chair it should last for as long as you need it to."
6055,"Wondfo Pregnancy Test Strips, 25-count",1/1,5.0,I was able to find out that I was pregnant before any of the drugstore test kits claim you can get a positive - well before a missed period. Sensitive and reliable.
6056,Over Bed Table,0/0,4.0,"Bought this for my husbands laptop, very sturdy works good. It is a little tall for use in a recliner unless you remove wheels. Better priced and sturdier than actual &#34;laptop tables&#34;."
6057,Wella Color Charm 50 Light Drabber 1.4oz,0/0,2.0,After reading other reviews here I had high hopes that this product would mean the end to brass in my dyed blonde hair. So I added two capsful to the L'Oreal extra light blonde tint/developer I buy at the drugstore. At first I was ecstatic at the cool ashy color I obtained after this process. But one week and two shampoos later the brass has started to reassert itself. What a disappointment! I've now ordered the Wella White Lady toner to see if its more purple color (as opposed to the blue in this one) will cancel out the yellow better and longer. Still I'd love to know why this Wella product essentially washed out. I did wait 48 hours before an initial shampoo.
6058,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Stingray,0/0,2.0,"I was worried from the beginning when I received a banged up brown cardboard box with the car and remote thrown in plastic bags inside. No packaging. No instructions. Nothing. I removed the car and it was covered in dust. My first thought was that it was used, but after inspecting the wheels, I don't think it was because they were perfect.I put batteries in the remote and let my son play with it. At first it was fun. He ran it around the house and then outside, but within about an hour, the remote stopped working. Changing batteries did no good at all. Save your money."
6059,Andis Small Pet Clipper Combs 9 Piece Set model #12860,1/1,5.0,I have been clipping my Kerry Blue Terrier since I got him at the age of 4 months. He is now 5 years old. I have both an Andis and an Oster clippers. These clipper combs work for both. Great buy!!
6060,"""The Claw"" Electronic Candy Grabber Machine Arcade Game",0/0,5.0,"I thought having this at home would lessen the need for change at the doors of stores, but not so. This is just a way to practice for the bigger ones. That's O.K. because I too, enjoy the claw. The toy is a lot of fun for all."
6061,"Coffee Masters Perfect Potful Chocolate Raspberry Ground Coffee, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,This is good coffee and worked well with my Keurig Eckobrew. The raspberry flavor is not a good as the Godiva I had previously but is ok. I would also like it a little darker roast.
6062,"BSN Noxplode 2.0, 2.48 Pounds",1/1,4.0,To put it plainly I love this product NOW... But not in the beginning and really not for the first couple weeks. I had diarrhea so bad it sucked hahaha. After some research I found that this is common and learned of ways to use the product more efficiently. For example smaller doses and don't take it with creatin and don't dare drink any coffee before or after and any caffeine oriented drink. Also that the side effects will soon lessen. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not five. Hope this helps
6063,VTech - Genius Notebook,0/0,5.0,"Excellent very good product works perfectly, very good my daughter still plays with it and I have more than three years that the purchase is in excellent condition and perfect."

6065,Neurosmith Sunshine Symphony,0/0,3.0,"This toy plays a wonderful selection of music but it states that there are 2 modes of play and we have toggled between the 2 modes only to discover that there is really only 1 mode. We have replaced the toy with a new one thinking that it was defective and it was the same situation. Overall, we like it because the music is very nice to listen to. I just wish it worked as advertised."

I ask how were the chicken breast seasoned? They told me Chef Paul. I had to have the seasoning. They have it in the local grocery store, but a little pricey. Ordered it on line for much better price"

6070,ROYAL Canin Treats for Dogs (17.6 oz),0/0,4.0,"Our dog is 15 yr.old and he will only eat these treats, being they are made of vegies don't mind his choice. Our vet. used to carry them but not many bought them so they were discontinued, being they were hard to find have to order from Amazon which makes it easy."

6075,Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,0/0,5.0,"This was one of my first purchases as a homeowner....I decided on this item based on a few other wonderful reviews. It really does deliver. I have a larger dog, and I find this scoop can handle the ""situation."" I find it slides right under the business, without ripping all the grass up. I suggest it for anyone who has a yard and a dog... I would certainly replace this with an identical product if it broke, or was lost, or stolen, or destroyed in an act of God.Now that winter has appeared in the mid-west, I have discovered that the ""Wire rake scooper for grass"" is really best on the grass. Not the greatest on frozen ground...does OK on snow, but sort of useless on the hard earth, it can't get underneath the business. I think I'll have to consider another type for the winter. This doesn't take away from my opinion of it, as it is clearly listed as ""wire rake scooper FOR GRASS."""
6076,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Figure 8 Set Expansion Pack,0/0,5.0,Got my 2 year old the Figure 8 and this Expansion pack and it provides plenty of track for him and many different ways to build. It is a terrific starter addition. Just get it on sale and it is worth the money!
6077,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,4.0,"I hate to scoop. This litter box makes life easier, especially with 3 cats. (Long story but I have a soft heart and new felines keep needing someone to care for them.) I own two of these boxes. I hope that Omega will make the boxes a bit sturdier in the next generation but thus far these have proven solid for our family. If someone makes a better litter box than this, I'll buy it. Two even."
6078,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"I was skeptical that it would be so easy, or that the two halves would actually stay together when it rolled, but it works as advertised. Makes my life easier."

6080,Wire Rake Scooper for Grass,0/0,4.0,"I used to use the claw-type pooper scoopers, and I really like them, but they tend to only last 3-9 months before the plastic breaks apart. I was looking to see if there was a metal version, and I came across this one. The photo was a little unclear, so I thought it was a claw-type like my old ones, just made of metal instead. It's not. It's a rake, single-sided, and I expected to hate it. Surprisingly, I kind of like it. The rake is angled so that poop stays in it until you're ready to dump it into a bag. In some ways, it's more efficient than the old plastic claw-type scoops, in that it can pick up more in one swoop. My only complaints are (1) the tines do tend to get stuck in grass sometimes (or, in my case, on the threads binding the large swaths of artificial turf in my backyard), and (2) the handle is a little uncomfortable after scooping for a while. For the second half of the yard, I had to alternate hands because mine were getting sore from the handle. Aside from that, I like it, and expect that it will last longer than my other ones (fingers crossed)."
6081,"ProVersa JWM6CF Wall Mount Hair Dryer with 2-Speed and 3-Heat Settings, 1600-Watts, White Finish",0/0,5.0,"We purchased the first Jerdon wall mount dryer about 10 years ago. I have severe arthritis and like how much power is available in such a small, lightweight, wall mountable unit. It drys my thick, medium length,colored hair very quickly.We liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall). Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell. My husband said I should have kept the air intake a bit cleaner. Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life span.We just finished remodeling our master bathroom and no longer want a wall-mountable unit, so it is being installed in the guest bathroom. It can fit in small spaces leaving the bath counter free for our guests. I highly recommend this dryer."
6082,Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith,0/0,3.0,"It is supposed to change your voice, I know but several family members have tried it and every setting sounds like a struggling Darth Vader. Boy still had fun with it for a while but it lost it's appeal quickly due to the fact no one could understand what you were saying, voice change or no."

6088,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"I cannot sleep without some background noise, a radio keeps me awake listening, a fan is too breezy all year, etc. cheaper sleep machines have weird noises like chirping birds or running water on a looping repeating soundtrack and those annoy me.This is from I think air flowing thru the machine, can make some adjustments to tone and a little volume up or down. I slept wonderfully!!Small and compact.Highly recommend"
6089,Graviola Wild Crafted Amazon Therapeutic Laboratories 1 oz Liquid,0/0,5.0,"I bought these tea leaves to Use in my reusable kuerig KCup in the coffee maker.

6099,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,5.0,"I'm a little embarrased to admit that Ingrid is the first CG Polish I've ever owned.... despite being a lover of all things polish. being a single mom on a budget, i originally set a pretty low limit on the amout im allowed to spend on a bottle of polish. But after a while I realized it was worth it once in a while. I may be the queen of drugstore cosmetics, but I certainly see the value in buying a good brand like CG. You get what you pay for, and I do think my beloved ingrid was worth it. The color is beautiful, the formula is great, and its wearability is awesome. In person, the color is different to me than the swatches...as most bloggers will tell you. But, unlike some, I love the color in person. Kinda muddy, in a good way, with gold micro shimmer. This may just be the beginning of a love affair between me and China Glaze"

6107,Evening Primrose Oil 1300mg Royal Brittany Twin Pack - 60+60 - Softgel,0/0,5.0,"The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations."
6108,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,5.0,"I don't know what I was really expecting, but this squeegee works very, very well. It took me about 10 seconds to wipe down the glass doors after showering today, and it did a great job... totally dry afterwards. Big plus is the fact that the squeegee came with a suction cup holster that keeps it handy on the shower wall. Great purchase."

So we asked him if he wanted Santa to bring him a trumpet and he said YES!He goes to sleep with his trumpet and it goes everywhere with him.It is very easy to play I like the fact that it is so true to life. The sound that comes out is pleasant and not blasting. Now he wants a trombone. Sooooo... Bontempi, please make one for little guys!"
6111,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"Well, I don't see why people can't just leave a good product alone! This WAS a good product but this box of diapers has a bad smell. It's like Pampers has added a perfume or fragrance and now the diapers smell really bad! My son had bad diaper rash & I feel the perfume/fragrance delayed the healing of and maybe even inhibited the healing process.Not good! Will be looking for a new brand of diapers! Will never buy Pampers baby dry again and am very disappointed!"

A friend of his had these glasses and I just had to give them a try....bought him 2 pair for christmas and they are a hit! He puts them on in the morning and they just stay there, ready when he needs them, but if he doesn't, he simply pulls them apart and lets them hang around his neck. They are so lightweight that he doesn't feel them weighing him down. They are little pricier than others but well worth the cost....Great product!!"

Whenever the speaker activates because our guy is making noise, it sounds like a distorted helicopter. It loses connection randomly, beeps all the time. We are about to toss it and buy a new one, to be honest. I don't understand, it seems to have &#34;worn out&#34; which makes no sense. It is just a speaker and monitor, nothing to fail..."

6121,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,1/1,5.0,"First of all I have to say...if you CAN use a regular blade razor with shaving cream, soap, or what have you, DO IT! An electric razor will *NEVER* shave as close as a regular blade razor (nope, no totally silky soft skin), nor will you shave as quickly, so stop looking at electric razors to save time...because you won't.What I wouldn't give to be able to use a blade razor. Unfortunately, my skin is ultra-sensitive and every time I try to shave my legs with a blade razor they itch so much after about 30 minutes that only drawing blood will get me to stop scratching my legs (no matter what moisturizer I use), and I don't even want to think about the ingrown hairs that develop after a couple of days. I've tried everything for ""after-shave"" to help...from Tend Skin to exfoliation...and nothing works for me. So, I'm stuck using electric razors.If there's a better electric razor out there for women, I have not found it. I've tried at least ten different ones and this is, by FAR, the best that I've tried. It's the closest shave I've found in an electric, doesn't pull at all unless I'm going WAY too fast, has never nicked me once, and really hugs my legs because of the pivoting head. I've had my Panasonic razor for probably three years, and the rechargeable battery is still kicking. I still get at least 30 minutes out of it on a charge. It was at least 45 when I first got it! OK, so I have to go over some spots twice to get all of the hair...oh well! I can definitely live with that, and I've had the same problem with every other electric I've used. To me, this is the best women's electric shaver out there."

6123,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,1/1,5.0,"I'm a little embarrased to admit that Ingrid is the first CG Polish I've ever owned.... despite being a lover of all things polish. being a single mom on a budget, i originally set a pretty low limit on the amout im allowed to spend on a bottle of polish. But after a while I realized it was worth it once in a while. I may be the queen of drugstore cosmetics, but I certainly see the value in buying a good brand like CG. You get what you pay for, and I do think my beloved ingrid was worth it. The color is beautiful, the formula is great, and its wearability is awesome. In person, the color is different to me than the swatches...as most bloggers will tell you. But, unlike some, I love the color in person. Kinda muddy, in a good way, with gold micro shimmer. This may just be the beginning of a love affair between me and China Glaze"
6124,Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS Game,0/0,3.0,I had one of these growing up so I thought my son would love one since he adores robots! We have fun but without fail the Red Rocker's head never pops up in a fight. Blue Bomber's head will pop up even if you hit the base of the game. My son likes to play it but if you have to be the Blue guy you will always loose.

However, after the 1st 15 days, it's not as effective. You may need to give your body a rest before taking on another bottle."
6128,Casual Canine Reflective Jacket,0/0,5.0,"First time I put it on my dog he loved it. It just sits down waiting for me to put it on,I just had it for a week and its already dirty. It has a small poach on e backThis fit my 62-70 pound Labrador mix. Almost identical to the picture here. My Toby is a little lean skinny guy. It fit him perfect.Seems like I'm going to need to wash it in less than one week useThe outside is smooth, kinda like suede.I love it, my dog loves it my girlfriend loved it. And he looks cute for an older doggy."
6129,PlasmaCar Red,0/0,5.0,This is an awsome product. I have 2 children with disabilities and this was perfect for them. My only issue is that yellow centercap for the steering wheel pops out. This could be a potential choking hazzard. Otherwise the entire family has enjoyed riding them.

I have a female cat that loves to hunt, pounce and carry these around. She drops them at my feet for me to throw them so she can chase and catch them over and over. Easy for her to pickup and carry and safe. They hold up well. many times I can't find one and out of the blue she will show up again with it!.Thank you!"
6132,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,5.0,I cannot even begin to describe how amazing this razor is. I have super sensitive skin and always used to get really bad razor burn on my neck with conventional razors. This single blade razor is nice and heavy and goes across my face like a feather on a babies butt. Even my wife noticed how much of a closet and smoother shave this provided. My razor burn is gone. I love this razor!It comes with 1 razor to get you startedIts super easy to cleanExtremely easy to use

6135,Bvlgari Aqua Pour Homme Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"So, it smells GREAT! I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it is a really nice scent. I actually bought it based on reviews alone (was lead to it by Amazons recommendations since I had purchased Curve in the past) and I have to say, it does not disappoint. He immediately sprayed it on Christmas morning and it was a very pleasant but, a tad strong. I would suggest no more than 2-3 sprays at a time. With colognes like Curve, you need a bit more I suppose because it's kind of a light scent, but this has more substance AND staying power. It lasts all day. I recommend it and so does the Mr. :)"

6139,CK Products 4 Ounce Sanding Sugar Bottles,1/1,5.0,I used these for some champagne jello shots and they worked as described in the recipe I was working off of. These were also cheaper then I have seen the same product in local stores.
6140,"MasterPieces / Puzzle Glue, 5 oz",0/0,5.0,"This is an easy to use great product. One 5oz bottle is perfect for a 1000 piece puzzle. I did 2 coats on front and one heavy coat on back and you can hold the puzzle in one hand straight out. It was fun to glue my reservoir dogs (classic Terrentino film) puzzle and hang it in my computer room. I would buy this product again simple, cheap, and effective."
6141,"Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shave, 1 razor",0/0,2.0,It's not for me. Just didn't get the close shave that I thought I'd get. Still had to go back over my head with a different razor to get what the cut I needed.
6142,Elenco 100x-750x Zoom Microscope Set,0/0,1.0,I read the reviews and thought this would be a good first microscope for my grandson. We founf this to be very flimsy when using-primarily made of plastic and no weight. Light through view finder was very low no matter at what setting. First thing I have ever had to return .
6143,"Natracare Organic All Cotton Tampons, Non-Applicator, Regular, 20 Count Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,2.0,they are hard to unwrap! it's very annoying sitting in the bathroom struggling to open your tampon. i don't recommend them.
6144,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,"Purchased for my 9 year old nephew, who loves it, and my 23 year loved it just as much if not more. They built projects for hours together. Many different projects to experiment with, and learn new concepts from as they go. And then they have a new toy to play with afterward, that they built themselves! I like that the parts have the technical symbol on them, so it becomes second nature in associating parts to their symbols. I was surprised that, with no electronics background, they were determining what was happening in a circuit on their own, and were able to make some changes to affect how the circuit worked. An excellent product that will continue to teach and entertain for many years to come - AND you can even add on to expand its capabilities."
6145,Crayola 120ct Original Crayons,0/0,5.0,There is nothing negative I can about this.There really are 120 different colors. They really are ALL different (unlike the box of 64 colored pencils). It comes in a great sturdy box with a crayon sharpener. I'm 33 and I love coloring!
6146,Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover with Pivoting Head,0/0,4.0,"The Finishing Touch Hair Remover is a good product for ""light"" usage such as; fine hairs on face, eye brows, etc. I was surprised I have to use it as much as a razor. Perhaps frequency will go down as I use it, it's only been a week."
6147,David Rio Flamingo Vanilla Decaf Sugar Free Chai 3lb. Bag,0/0,5.0,I have been drinking this decaf Chai for many years. David Rio is the best! I always have a cup before bedtime -- better than a sleeping pill -- really relaxes you and sleep comes naturally!
6148,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"I have another one of these we bought a couple of years ago. We decided to buy another one when our twin boys were fighting over the seats to sit in. It was slightly different, which they did recognized at first, but at least the no longer fight over which chair to sit in. Helps with the sanity of raising kids C ;"
6149,JOYRIDE SPECIAL EFFECTS/HAIR,0/0,1.0,"I really love dying my hair bright purple, and every time I have ever dyed it purple I've used Special Effects Dye. I decided one day that I wanted to try a new shade of purple and instead of buying my usual ""Pimpin Purple"" from Special Effects, I tried this one. Big mistake. My hair was already reasonably bright purple, and has been purple for 8 months now, it is even bleached, I just wanted to touch it up since a few spots had faded. I bought 2 bottles and put it on, I even let it sit for 4 HOURS, and it looks EXACTLY the same. It didn't even cover the faded spots. This color of dye is definitely the worst Special Effects Dye I've used, it was more watery as I spread it through my hair, and like someone else said, more like a glaze. If you like purple, I'd definitely still suggest Special Effects Dyes, just not this one. Pimpin Purple works extremely well in comparison."
6150,"Focus Factor for Adults, Tablets, 60 tablets",1/1,1.0,"This product is really good, but I'm not reviewing about the product. When I ordered this product, I bought it in pack of 2 bottles. Result? I got only 1 bottle instead of 2. This is a scam. Watch out."

6154,Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment Pack,0/0,5.0,"I loved the sponges since they were to use with a machine from neutrogena I believe it was called ""pure glow"" and that they subsequently upgraded to a new machine to do microdermabrasion but was so much more expensive. The point is"
6155,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,4.0,"I love this color! It looks like I have pieces of metal on my fingers (which I wanted when I bought this). But it chips, even when you use top clear coat. It's kind of thin, so you have to use more which causes chipping."
6156,Radio Flyer 12S Classic Walker Wagon,1/1,5.0,"My toddler has loved this wagon since he first started to scoot around at 8 months. It really helps babies practice and learn to walk. Once he got older he started putting his toys in it and carting it around. Now he has a little baby brother he loves to push in it. It is extremely durable and although pricey compared to other wagons, totally worth the price. It also has stoppers on the wheels that help to slow it down so it doesn't speed out of control. We've had this for almost two years and gotten a ton of use out of it. It still looks new. One of the best baby/kid purchases I've made."
6157,Original Papaya Enzyme by American Health,0/0,5.0,"These are great for the to-go papaya enzyme user.I use these after EVERY meal as I have had my intestines altered and it helps wonderfully digest when I have a lot of protein, carbs or am full. I love these. Great mild taste."
6158,Vo-toys Rubber Tug Toy 13 Length,0/0,5.0,"My dog loves playing tug. I had been buying the rope tugs, but I couldn't afford them at the rate she was going through them. The other problem with the rope style is that if it she got to it unsupervised, she would destroy it. I wanted to try a rubber version. This was the first one I bought, and I chose it because it was relatively cheap. I didn't want to spend a lot on a toy that might not work out for us.To my delight, this tug toy was perfect, a great value and the item I will buy again when it comes time to replace it. My dog loves it as much as her ropes, although there was an adjustment period, and she can't destroy it quickly. This is really saying something because chewing for my dog is serious business.It's worth noting that the product I received looks different from the item pictured on Amazon. The good news is that the item I received is fundamentally the same and is actually more attractive."
6159,1/55 D/C AH-64 Apache Helicopter,0/0,5.0,What a great helicopter!!! Loads and loads of fun!! Great product...really sturdy! Great for little hands! Highly recommend this for imaginative play!
6160,"India Tree Vanilla Sugar, 3 lb",0/0,5.0,"I'm a man and had never heard of 'vanilla sugar'. i wanted to make 'Creme Brulee' and it calls for vanilla sugar. I searched the internet on vanilla sugar and rather than making my own from scratch, which is very expensive, or buying pre-made vanilla sugar. I purchased this jar and it tastes really good and my 'Creme Brulee' turned out fantastic!! Highly recommended. Tasted as good as the 'Creme Brulee' at the Capital Grille (one of my favorite restaurants). If you need vanilla sugar, this is highly recommended. Thanks-"
6161,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,0/0,5.0,"I was always using Pampers dry for my little one, untill it started leaking for her. I switched to huggies snug dry and no more leaks.

6165,As Seen On TV 'Dryermax Dryer Lint Removal Kit',1/1,3.0,"Bought this a couple of years back and it worked great for it's intended purpose.....kind of. Had to use a pro vacuum/blower to complete the job on a 20' run consisting of 2 turns within 4' and then a straight run. On the same house, some time later I used the same gear...only with a pro blower leading into said product and a pro vacuum sucking in at the outlet. 3 years later, the product cracked at the spout. Useless at that point.Call a pro or have the extra gear necessary to get the job done for a short run and be prepared to possibly purchase often. This is not a buy it once item."
6166,Fruit and Vegetable Basket,0/0,5.0,I feel like i got duped on the price but as far as the merchandise - it is as good as can be expected - it is not cheap plastic - its hard hollow plastic - it will last a while and she LOVES it - but i should have found it cheaper - my bad!
6167,Dri-Eze Hearing Aid Dehumidifier,0/0,5.0,This product met all my expectations.

It is easy to use (just place aids and batteries {removed from the aid} into the canister wile providing a convenient storage facility.

6172,Bang Gun with Flag,0/0,3.0,This gun is a very simply and cheaply made toy. I bought it to go along with my Harley Quinn cosplay and it looks cute in pictures but isn't all that great to actually use. You have to roll up the flag nice and neat and reset the trigger every time you use it.
6173,Manic Panic Semi Permanent Hair Dye Mystic Heather Light Purple/Violet,2/2,4.0,"This also makes a really nice pink when mixed with conditioner, but it's staying power is not great.Even without conditioner this one fades very fast, but it fades out to such a pretty pink that I don't even mind it.This dye has a very faint blue undertone to it which makes the faded pink really nice and pastel. (I used a hot pink shade, and it faded out as an orange/pink, I prefer this purple/pink fade much more)!"
6174,Hylauronic Acid Day Creme,0/0,4.0,"When I was using this product I liked it. However, I found a product I like a little better for now. I may switch back and forth between new product and this one. Only problem I had with it was it was a little thick for a day cream for me."

If you don't believe me, check out the science behind how it is made, what it REALLY contains- not the hype from the manufacturer about how its made from sugar- sugar doesn't have a nasty chemical aftertaste. Canada was the first country to allow this into the food supply and now they wonder why the have an exponential climb in the diagnosis of IBS!!! DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR SYSTEM!!!"

6190,Duro-Med Deluxe Swivel Seat Cushion,0/0,5.0,"Bought for elderly parent with back issue for getting in and out of the car. Works perfectly! Not only does this ease his pain, he sits taller in his seat. I would highly recommend this product."
6191,Alex Toys Tea Set Basket,0/0,1.0,"I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. She just opened the wrapping, had the basket handle in her hand and the clasp broke, was not attached at all, the basket opened and all the dishes fell out breaking four of them. She was delighted with the set, it is unfortunate that the basket latch was not properly attached."
6192,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,3.0,The nice high edges make this pad appear to be very plush and padded. It's not. The pad squishes right down to the ground offering almost no comfort for my large dog. This pad also sheds more than my dog does. IF he uses it there always seems to be shedded pieces of fake wool all over my carpet. He doesn't like it so he tries to fit his 120 pound butt into the bed we have for my 20 pound dog. Needles to say he smashed the little dogs pad but he won't use this one.
6193,Nylabone Dura Chew Bone,0/0,5.0,"It's not me you want to consult with about this product, but since my dogs can't type, I will pass on their opinion, which is that Nylabone makes the BEST chew bones of anyone! The material that they are made from is quite durable, although eventually it will be reduced in size. The only problem we have ever had with Nylabone chew toys is with the larger Galilieo bones, The dogs chew the ends down to a point, and a few of our dogs have cracked a tooth on the toy when its gets worn down this way. We have learned to cut off the sharpened edges, which leaves a blunt end."
6194,Scrabble,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my grand niece who is having her tenth birthday this month. It was on her wish list, so I am confident that she will be happy with it. I like it because it is a great way for her to learn."
6195,WAHL Professional 2 Hole Precision Clipper Blade (Model:1045-100),0/0,4.0,Sharper than what came with my original Wahl razor. It was easy to remove the old one and install the new one.
6196,Small World Living Toys Happy Birthday Cake Set,0/0,4.0,"This is a nice product but it couldv'e taken it another step and lit up the candles! That would be awsome! But, my grand-daughter loves it."
6197,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set,0/0,4.0,"I think that for the price, it would be difficult to find another set with as many pieces and of the same quality. Our son is 28 months and he loves it! We ended up keeping some of the smaller pieces in the drawer of the Melissa and Doug train table to be used when he is a litte bit older ( I.e. the trees and the people- for now just the trains and the tracks are enough!) All of the pieces are solid wood and great quality. DEFINITELY buy the SureTrack clips for the tracks - they are sold by another company but are compatible with this set and are a must have as little ones knock the tracks down every 10 seconds. The clips hold the tracks together and saves you from having to set the tracks up 500 times a day! We bought two sets of the clips for $20 and it was worth every cent! Overall, we are happy with the quality, detail and price of this set."
6198,"YS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC HONEY Raw, Unprocessed, Unpasteurized - Kosher 32oz",1/1,5.0,"I`ve only tried a few different raw honeys, but I would rate this one the best. Smooth texture and great taste. I will buy again."
6199,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Elevated Track Foundation,0/0,5.0,"Recommend this product. We are trying to glue down a train set-up on a train table and this is a nice finishing touch (extra tall bridge, basically double elevation)."
6200,LEGO Education DUPLO Brick Set 779027 (144 Pieces),0/0,5.0,it met all expectations and it was our little grandson's 1st. set of Leggos. He was thrilled and they even came in earlier than expected!
6201,Carex Bed Buddy Warming Footies,0/0,1.0,"Several things:1. Shoddy workmanship. They look thick, but they aren't. The minute I (carefully) put them on the first time I could hear seams tearing. The fabric is much thinner than it appears in the photo.2. They don't get warm enough. The instructions say to microwave them 30 seconds. I did so. Not warm. The instructions said you can heat for another 30 seconds but never more than 1 minute total. They were not warm.So, inasmuch as they don't heat well and aren't made to last, I'm returning them."
6202,Paul Mitchell Lavender Mint Moisturizing Shampoo & Conditioner 1L (33.8oz)each W/ Pumps,0/0,5.0,"I love Paul Mitchell products. This shampoo and conditioner smell so good and are so good for your hair! I do find though, that this conditioner is a little too moisturizing for my fine hair. I only use it once every few days for moisturizing."
6203,"BISSELL Fabric & Upholstery Shampoo, 9351",0/0,5.0,I've tried everything to clean my microsuede furniture. Now it looks almost new! I will definately buy this product again.
6204,iCell Tech Size 10 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,5.0,"I have a hearing aid that eats up batteries. I get about 3 days out of one. When I found this deal for 60 batteries, I was sold. No more saving coupons to buy the expensive ones in the stores. These might even last longer than the Duracells"
6205,Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 16 beans JR Mushrooms brand,0/0,5.0,"I received these super quick in the mail. I wanted vanilla beans to make my own vanilla extract. I made it yesterday and the beans smell wonderful and in two months I can let you know how it turned out. Again the shipping was quick, it was packaged well, and the company even tells you how to store the remaining beans. Plus they give you a coupon for a percent off of your next purchase with them. If my vanilla turns out well I'm buying more and will give them away for presents next Christmas!"

6207,Peg Perego 12 Volt Battery Charger,0/0,5.0,"The batteries for these vehicles for kids are outrageously high, so a battery charger is a must to keep them running. One of these little accessories is a must if you are planning on keeping those jeeps and cars on the move."
6208,George's Aloe Vera Aloe Vera Liquid,0/0,5.0,"I have suffered with GI issues all of my life. Over 20 years ago, I was diagnosed with ""an excellent breeding ground for stomach ulcers"", IBS, celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Fun! Searching for a healing approach, in addition to abstaining from gluten and lactose, I had the good fortune to be introduced to George Warren. We met for about an hour, all the time sipping on a glass of aloe. His convictions were so strong re"
6209,Trend Lab Diaper Stacker,0/0,1.0,"(Teal) I stacked this item with diapers for the first time and the tie broke from the weight. Very cheaply made and would not recommend to anyone. Pay a little more and get a little more. However, Amazon was extremely awesome when I wanted to return and credited me right away."
6210,Judy's Candy Co. Sugar Free Vanilla Pecan Caramels,0/0,4.0,Liked the product. I didn't love it. I felt like it was a small quantity for the price. Probably won't buy it again.
6211,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Deluxe Railroad Crossing,0/0,5.0,"grandson loves this he likes the two types of bells that ring , its sturdy wood, great value ,a must for train lovers."
6212,"GENOVA TONNO OLIVE OIL, 24 pack of 5 oz cans",0/0,5.0,Sent as a gift and it was well appreciated. It is better than clearing off a shelf in the few supermarkets that carry it.
6213,Small World Toys Activity (It's a Party Tea Set) 8,0/0,5.0,My 9 yr old daughter loved this set. She plays with it every day. It is high quality and Im sure it will last a lifetime.
6214,Childrens DHA 250 mg Strawberry Flavor By Nordic Naturals,1/1,1.0,"I was specifically looking for a chewable organic/natural dha vitamin for my kiddos. I wanted something better quality than the gummies you can pick up at T@rg#t or W@lmart. These ones are not truly chewables. They're just softgels. I tried one and gagged. Might be great for kids old enough for swallowing pills, but they shouldn't advertise it as a chewable for kids. I bought the same thing in the liquid version and we're having better luck with that."
6215,"Spenco 2nd Skin Squares, 200 Gel Squares",0/0,3.0,"These weren't really what I expected. I had learned about these in book I read about a woman who hiked the PCT. I figured if they were good for a serious hiker, they should be great for a vaca involving lots of walking. I don't think the two are necessarily comparable. I was on a warm weather holiday, so I was wear sandals and not wearing socks too often at all. These really need more support to stay put. I did, of course, use surgical tape too. But it just got so messy. I'll keep them around (although there are a TON of them- maybe I'll share them!) for hikes and things. But for use in situations where I'll be wearing cute little shoes, a blister band aid, or simple band-aid for that matter, will be my choice.And someone mentioned they stick together. They do!! BIG TIME! Not a huge deal, but it's notable they're not particularly user-friendly if you want them applied in &#34;clean&#34; looking manner (i.e., not bulking or slipping all over), and they don't come out of the container neatly either. But all in all, they're OK.If you're a serious hiker or outdoorsperson who is on your feet for many hours (or perhaps a factory worker, or on socked feet for longer periods) I would suggest giving them a shot."
6216,Quercetti Super Saxoflute,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my 20 month old son for Christmas. Though it was a bit of a last minute gift (and I wasn't entirely sure what he would think of it), it was without a doubt one of the biggest hits of the day. No, it isn't really a 'musical instrument' per se, but it is still heck of a lot of fun. He loves putting the pieces together to form weird and wonderful shapes, then marches around blasting away with it. And no, it isn't the most melodious sound ever (far from it), but it has kept him entertained for a good hour a day, every day. A great addition to the toy box. Highly recommended!"
6217,"KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Peanut Butter",0/0,5.0,I got my dog the large Kong toy for christmas. These fit inside perfect and she has a good old time trying to get it out. I have never had a complaint about a Kong product. I will definitely be getting a refill of these
6218,Crayola Ultimate Art Supply Case-Colors May Vary,0/0,5.0,"What you see in the pic(s) is what ya get. Pretty basic, but will provide lots of fun (yes, this did surprise me because my kid is a thin marker devotee). Case is tough and easy for kids to open and close. Good selection of colors, glue is easy to use. I would say for sixers and below- above that and you will get ""pshaw""s. This review is a reflection of my daughter's (early 5) interaction with this set that I observed- I just want to reiterate that upon first adult glances it seems boring, but it transformed my daughter into a mini Warhol. She does have a shoe fetish..."
6219,Ultimate Nail Studio Kit,0/0,5.0,The ultimate nail studio kit is an excellent item for any young girl! It keeps her and her friends playing for hours!
6220,Manhattan Toy Winkel,1/3,1.0,"The product appears to be colorful and perfect for a teething baby, HOWEVER...I bought this solely because it came up when I searched for ""toys not made in China"". The list was extremely limited so I trusted that the short list would include only what I had requested. I purchased two toys. Both toys, selected from this very limited list, say very clearly that they were made in China. This is the second time I have purchased and returned ""toys not Made in China"" from Amazon. I am so frustrated and disgusted."
6221,"Scruples Enforce Sculpting Glaze, 8.5 Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,I have used the product before and like it a great deal. It does a fine job with my thin hair.
6222,Bach Essence Cherry Plum 20 Milliliters,0/0,2.0,I didn't get cherry plum. I got Olive instead. Anyway maybe it's a sign from the flower essence gods that that's what I need.

6226,BeautyBlender Sponge,0/0,5.0,"I've used make up sponges for years, but the last few years they all tend to have a rubbery finish that just smears the makeup around. I've had to cut off the outside to get to the spongey part of them at times. I did not know if I'd like these, but was getting desperate. Every time I find a type of sponge that I like, then they discontinued it.These sponges are great. I read a review on them that suggested putting the makeup on my face w/ my fingers first, then using these to &#34;finish&#34; it. I did not really want to go there, but decided to give it a shot. It worked great and I continue to apply it in this way.I use face wash to clean these - the foaming face wash works best - and I wash them out about every 4-5 uses (I work my way around the sponge each time)..I am very pleased with this purchase!"
6227,"Coffee Masters Flavored Coffee, Creme Brulee, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)",0/0,4.0,"OUr favorite is Godiva Carmel or Creme Brulee which is not readily available anymore. This isn't quite as tasty, but comes very close. Thank you. Price is also much lower!"
6228,Nature's Way Blood Sugar,0/0,5.0,"Great product. Contains all the major herbal alternatives to Metformin. Can really help with blood sugar-relatd acne or PCOS. I learned from my genetics (23andme) that I am prone to diabetes and macular degeneration, so I'm using this as well as Jarrow carnosine to prevent blood sugar problems."

6231,Bruder Toys Man Garbage Truck Rear Loading Green,0/0,5.0,"Promotes imaginative play. Sturdy. Lifelike. The only fault I find with it is that the cabin doors do not open. That would seem to be easy to design . Two figures could be included also. We used corks, bottle caps and marbles for &#34;trash&#34;. My grandson (31/2) plays with it for hours on end and loves it. It's his favorite Christmas present! And now he knows what an Archimedes screw is!"
6232,"Black Jewel Popcorn, Bulk, 2 lbs",0/0,4.0,this popcorn is delicious and like the old fashion popcorn! I popped it without one kernal unpopped.. so it is easy to pop and so fresh tasting.

6239,Sudoku Westminster Sudoku on a Puzzle Cube,0/0,1.0,The sections do not move in a fluid manner. You really have to focus to keep the rows lined up so that you can rotate them. I would not buy it again.
6240,Melissa & Doug Princess Puppet,0/0,5.0,Extremely detailed and well made! Kids of all ages enjoy this puppet. I love how it comes with a wooden dowel to control the arm. And it's removeable so you can use it on either arm. It was a little big for my 3 year old but she'll grow into it. I can't wait to get more puppets and hopefully a puppet theater someday.

6242,Izumi Sweater Shaver,1/1,5.0,"I got this to replace a 1980s model Ambassador clothes shaver. I've used it three times, and it did a perfect job of removing pills and fuzz from my garments, left them looking new."
6243,Melissa & Doug Solar System 48 pcs Floor Puzzle,0/0,4.0,"Great puzzle for our four year old. I wish the picture was showing all the planets from the sun, instead of the moon. In school, kids learn the planets in order from the sun and that would have made more sense."

6246,Precision Gyroscope (colors may vary),2/2,3.0,"I bought this for my children recently, and was fairly disappointed; I specifically spent a few extra dollars on the ""precision"" model gyroscope, as better rotation and balance would allow more time for exploring the possibilities of gyroscopic motion, thus giving the kids more time to find fun things to do.Unfortunately, ""precision"" is not a word I would use to describe this toy out of the box.The first time I spun the gyroscope -- using the included toothed ripcord -- I noticed that the gyroscope was extremely noisy and vibrated a lot. I then tried spinning the gyroscope with a piece of string, but the string became caught between the pivot points (screws that penetrate the colored frame) and the rotor axis, causing it to jam, and resulting in my having to cut the string into pieces to extract it.Upon inspecting the axis of rotation I noticed some plastic flash on the rotor axis (left over from the casting process) so I trimmed that off with a hobby knife; the noise was significantly reduced, but the gyroscope still seemed unbalanced and noisy for a ""precision"" instrument. I then noticed that there was some play between the rotor and the pivot screws; this was the reason the thing ate my string"
6247,12 inch Inflatable Globe,0/0,2.0,"The product, though a nice inflatable globe, went flat within a week. The &#34;patch kit&#34; only works in a hole that appears on a smooth service. The creases in the globe (the likely place for a leak) cannot be repaired."
6248,"Nutri-Pet Research Nupro Joint Supplement for Dogs, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,My vet told me 10 years ago that my dog would need leg surgery. I put her on this product and she never had that surgery! The vet thinks she is doing just fine. She is 12 yrs old now and can still charge across the yard like a young pup.
6249,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"Mochacciono Syntha-6 is the best protein I've ever tasted, hands down. It mixes great with water or milk, and doesn't leave me feeling too full. Great for post-workout recovery."
6250,THORNE RESEARCH - Vitamin A - 90ct [Health and Beauty],1/1,4.0,"Be careful taking too much Vitamin A, especially in the winter. You have to take Vitamin D at the same time, or this could cause a Vitamin D deficiency. I took this while not taking Vit D and got a fracture. So watch out!That said, not a bad product."
6251,Learning Resources 12-Inch Inflatable Globe,1/1,2.0,I bought this for my 1 year old daughter to play with. It's a perfect size for her to throw around. But it had a hole right out of the bag. I tried to repair with tape but it still leaked air. I trashed it as the price wasn't even worth returning. :(
6252,Armani Mania Eau de Parfum for Women by Giorgio Armani,0/0,5.0,"Awww...it's been discontinued! I absolutely LOVE this fragrance and I get compliments every time I wear it, so naturally, it is now the only fragrance I own. People (a good majority are men) are always asking me what fragrance I'm wearing, so I am SO SAD that the ""Mania"" has been discontinued. I can still find it on the net, but there is going to come a time when I can no longer find it and unfortunately, I have yet to find a similar fragrance. I am trying to build a stockpile of this product, so when anybody asks me what I would like for my birthday, Mother's Day, etc., I tell them I would like a bottle of this perfume. Wow...maybe I should be keeping this ""my little secret"" so I won't attract any other lover's of this perfume :-)"

6259,"OTC ProChoice Cock-Up Wrist Splint, Left",0/0,5.0,"After wearing braces for 3 months, a lot of the damage was reversible and the rest can be mostly avoided by being very careful about ergonomics. I now have a Kenisis Advantage keyboard, MS thumb ball mouse, electric screw driver, Cuisinart Food Processor and Kitchen Aid Mixer. I found it very useful to keep the ibuprofen dosage at a bare minimum so that I can good feedback on how well I'm treating my wrists. Now my braces are gathering dust and will continue to do so as long as I'm careful."

I just don't know what one of the insects are. I know the butterfly is in the middle, but what is to the right of it? There is the spider and what is under that? Another butterfly? All and all, we will be buying more chunky puzzles. Recommend!"
6268,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,0/0,5.0,I have five cats but made a mistake...I only ordered one of these for them for Christmas! One of my cats has claimed this as her own so looks like I'll be buying four more. She plays until she literally starts panting! It's the best toy I've ever bought them and there have been quite a few toys it has beaten.I have found it very helpful to store the toy in the box it came in as then the cats can chew on neither the feathers or the pole when we aren't playing with it.

6275,Amazon.com,0/0,3.0,"The gun was actually pretty cool, very heavy and realistic but the actual belt and holster were terrible. It appears to be heavy good quality plastic or even a good attempt at fake leather but when I put it on my son it was way too big and wouldnt stay in place.....great gun terrible belt"

The figure is great, lots of details and a really good paint job. The sculp and the material almost makes you think of real tree bark and you can almost hear the brrramm sound coming from his mouth. The item arrived in perfect condition on almost a mint scale, it also arrived promply and before the due date. Really happy with the purchase and will buy again from this seller!"
6278,"Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I am hooked on this. I had to stop drinking soda to prevent migraines. I tried several other things, but when I found this I didn't need to look any further. I like my tea a little sweater, so I do add a little stevia to it."
6279,Fisher-Price Super Sounds Soccer,0/0,5.0,I had to take the sides off and redo it in order to add the screws because I put the net on too soon.Very cute. Ball is 6 inches in diameter which is ok for a 2 year old. Haven't actually used it yet to know about the sounds.
6280,Boiron - Arnica Gel,0/0,2.0,I saw this on Dr. Oz for pain. Dr. Oz was raving about its pain relief. I've tried it four or five times on my tennis/golf elbows. It did nothing to relief the pain. I don't recommend spending your money on this product.
6281,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I saw swatches of this color online and thought it was beautiful! Its like a deep, kinda blue purple! Love it and would reccommend it!"

6285,Cadbury Crunchie Bars (Case of 24),0/0,3.0,"I'm assuming that if you're thinking of buying 24 of them, you must already be a fan of the amazingness that is a Crunchie. Figuring you can spend upward of $3.50 on a single bar where I live, finding a case of 24 for less than $20 is definitely a steal.Though, the cheap price comes with a, well, price. The majority of the bars were broken. And I don't mean just broken in half, I mean in so many pieces that I basically had to eat part of it with a spoon. And in that sense, I'm glad they were just for myself and not designed as a gift!So that said, I would consider buying them from this source again if they were going to be just for myself- them being broken was an annoyance I got over pretty quickly since I was so excited to have Crunchies delivered to my door for so cheap!"

6289,Source Naturals Wellness Oil of Oregano,0/0,5.0,"This is strong and effective. It can be used internally or externally. I use a tiny amount to get rid of the sore red skin under my nose when I have a cold. Doing that burns for a minute and makes my eyes water, but the soreness is gone and doesn't return. That alone makes it worthwhile."
6290,Bye Bye Blemish Dry Lotion Drying 1 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I have some what of an acne problem. They are not actually acnes but little bumps that sometimes turn into acne or otherwise sink back down. But during the last couple of months they would not go away so I would tend to scratch it off which is a really bad habit. I read a review of this product on another site and I thought why not. It's pretty strong so it sometimes burns your eyes and dries your skin but it does the job. It got rid of my bumps in no joke 4 days. There are still abit left but I'm going to leave my skin for a couple of days since my skins reallly dry now. I really recommend it, I'm really surprised it works."
6291,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,Pretty neat idea. My dogs don't know what to make of it and it does quiet their barking however hasn't stopped them completely.
6292,"Zila Prodentec Rotadent Classic ToothBrush With 3 Brush Heads, White",0/0,4.0,"I bought my first rotodent toothbrush from my dentist's office and it lasted for 11 years. He now recommends a different brand. But, I continued with the rotodent as I like the round and pointed brushes. They work great with my many crowned and capped teeth."
6293,"Soft 'N Style 3"" Jumbo Bronze Hair Pin 1 Lb Box",0/0,5.0,I bought these pins for my daughter who is a professional dancer. She wears a bun every day of her life and she loves these pins! They are significantly more rigid than the pins you can get from the local drug store and much easier to use than 'bobby' pins. My daughter has very very long thick hair and 2 or 3 of these pins does the trick in no time at all.
6294,Seachem Ammonia Alert,0/0,2.0,I used this product to help with my fishless cycle. The readings were way off. Its ok to use as a supplement but I wouldn't use it as my only means of ammonia detection.
6295,Nature's Way Selenium,0/0,5.0,"When taken in conjunction with thyroid prescription medication, it gives it a boost, so perhaps you can cut down on the dosage of the Rx. OR, take the thyroid RX in the a.m., and then take the Selenium mid-day to extend the life of the thyroid medication. People don't get enough selenium in their diet because it's being milled and processed out of foods it is found in naturally (like breads). Another good source of selenium is mushrooms, but this seems a lot more powerful."
6296,"Coromega Omega-3 Fish Oil, Lemon Lime, 90 ct",1/1,5.0,I am not able to swallow the large size fish oil pills and have been taking the chewables but they contain very little fish oil. These packets have a good amount of fish oil and are easy to take. Taste is a little tart but they are so contrated that your're really taking a very little amount. No after burping. Convenient.

White Toplayer, Moderate Absorbency, Soaker Ounce 8oz., Each,PINK",0/0,5.0,I am a nurse and I bought this for her to protect her bed from any accidents that happen over night. It did not leak through and what's the best part is that it is washable. Disposable chux are very expensive and this is a better option.

6300,"New-Skin Liquid Bandage, First Aid Liquid Antiseptic, Over 50 Applications, 0.3 Fluid Ounce",3/3,5.0,"***This is not a scientific study, all evidence presented is anecdotal. ***I have now used New Skin twice on relatively large burns and abrasions with amazing results. Once was road rash after a bicycle race (~ 6 square inches over three wounds). The second was second and third degree burns from a camp fire (~ 4 square inches in two wounds).The road rash healed with almost no scarring, despite being deep enough to burn through the skin and subcutaneous fat.The burns are currently doing well, though it has only been a week and they have not healed completely.I have not been able to find many details about using New Skin on wounds this large. I don't know if it is safe, or even a good idea, but it seems to work.I have used both the spray and the brush applicator form of this product. The spray form is much easier to use and the liquid form is cheaper per application.In both cases, I did not apply New Skin for hours or days after the injury occurred. When applying I cleaned the wound with an aniceptic wash and allowed it to air dry. After it was dry I applied an even coat over the entire area and a 5-10mm border around the wound. It formed an artificial scab. I reapplied twice a day to fill in cracks and maintain the border. If you reapply a full coat each time you end up with a huge accumulation after a few weeks (1-3mm).The artificial scabs are transparent, so you ( and everyone around you if you're lucky enough to wound your hand) will be delighted with a view of what I believe is a mixture of plasma, platelets and blood. It looks like puss, but I think it's the liquid that dries to form real scabs (sometimes I spring a leak and it dries into a scab). IF THE WOUND BEGINS TO SWELL, FEEL HOT OR BECOME RED IT MIGHT BE INFECTED."

6302,GO Energy for the Skin Ginger People Ginger Chews Original,1/1,5.0,"Surprisingly (to me, anyway) these are hard to find, so I ended up doing subscribe and save from Amazon. These are delicious - I mainly purchased for motion sickness (but haven't traveled since I got these) and tummy troubles (this, I can tell you, works for me). I didn't expect it to be this yummy and addicting, but it is!FYI,- these are made in Indonesia.- ingredients"

6304,Plato Pet Treats Natural Salmon,0/0,5.0,"These little salmon 'pillows' are easy to break into pieces for smaller dogs. My Maltese dogs (4 pound Francey and 6 pound Frosty) will do back flips for these at bedtime!Watch out for the smell -- they're REALLY fishy smelling so you need to keep them in an airtight container with the lid closed; otherwise, your room will have a slightly obnoxious odor! Totally worth it as they're made in the USA by KDR Pet Treats in Logansport IN and an amazing value for the quantity you receive. They're not greasy and the crumblies left in the bottom of your treat jar can be sprinkled over food for finicky pups.Hope your furchildren love them as much as mine do!"

I look forward to many other times of fun with grandchildren with it in the future."
6308,"Darrell Lea Mango Soft Eating Liquorice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)",0/0,3.0,"While the flavor is great, there is a strong smell attached to both opened and unopened bags of this candy. For lack of a better phrase, it smells highly acidic, almost like cat urine."
6309,"Suzie's Whole Grain Thin Cakes, Puffed Brown Rice Crackers, 4.9-Ounce Bags (136g) (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,So happy to have found a product that is wholesome and good to eat. It is comforting to know that I can eat these cakes with virtually anything replacing many gluetin products that I am trying to avoid. Knowing that this product is high in fiber and low in calories means that I can eat it without worry or guilt. Thanks for a great product!
6310,Pure Essence One 'n' Only,0/0,5.0,I don't believe every product works the same on all bodies but for me this product is amazing. I always have more energy when I take it; not like a caffeine rush but a body feeling healthy kind of thing. The cost is less than so many other multis plus I like just having to take one tablet to get noticeable results.
6311,"Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea, India Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I love Chai tea - got hooked on it from Starbucks. I love this product because it has no sweetener in it and I can make it exactly how I want it. Usually chai tea comes loaded with sugar. I sweeten mine with Stevia. I drink so much of this that I am probably keeping Celestial Tea in business.
6312,Marineland Penguin Power Filter,0/0,3.0,When I ordered my first one I hooked it up and have been using it with no problems!! I love it. But I bought another one and its noisy and it had a broke bio wheel. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars. I'm sure with some work and a new bio wheel it would be just as quiet as my first one. But don't think I should I have to work on a new one.
6313,"Lactic Acid 70% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)",0/0,5.0,This is a great product if you know how to use it. I have had my face peeled professionally many times so I knew what to do. If you are not sure about it only use it for a few minutes the first time to see how your skin reacts.
6314,Werewolves of Millers Hollow,0/0,5.0,"I bought this game to play with a group of friends for our annual Christmas party, but was unsure if they would enjoy the accusation/rebuttal aspect of the game, turns out I didn't need to worry at all! Everyone got super into all aspects of the game, especially getting to accuse each other, and I think it may be the first time we have been able to play a game without accusations of cheating or people getting stroppy about losing. I've brought it along to the other gatherings we've had since then and it continues the be just as fun!"

6316,"Prilosec OTC Acid Reducer, Delayed-Release Tablets",0/0,3.0,"Does what it claims, but my Gasteroenterologist noted that Prevacid tends to last 12 hours per pill where this tends to last 8 or so? He pointed me to Prevacid instead of this."

6318,EggCrate Foam Mattress Pad - Thickness 3 inches,1/1,1.0,"After several days, it remains unexpanded and unusable. I would guess it's been in the warehouse since 1952. The Duro Med (blue foam) product was usable in 36 hours without problem, price was similar."
6319,Curious George Tin Tea Set,0/0,5.0,"I gave this to my two year old for Christmas and she loves it. Size is difficult to determine from the picture, so be aware that the scale is pretty small. Some reviewers were critical of the flimsy-ness of the tin. None of this will stand up to being stepped on by an adult, but has held up just fine (so far) to normal play."

6321,"Pirate's Booty Veggie, 4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,They taste quite good for something that contains veggies. My 2yr old son likes it. The package is too big so it will take us a while to finish all the bags.
6322,Pet Tornado,0/0,3.0,"It is not this colorful - it is just plain water and once you shake it, it does make a terrific tornado but it is not engaging enough. And if you don't turn it right, it just makes bubbles."
6323,Musgo Real Pre Shave Oil,0/0,5.0,"I will start out by saying that I'm very picky and I have to be. I seem to be that rare person who can't touch my finger to my face, without breaking out. The oils from my fingers clog my pores. Alot of shave lotions, oils and creams claim to be meant for sensitive skin, but irritate my face. This is the first and only product that I have used that will not clog my pores and will leave my face smooth as a baby's butt without leaving razor burns. Perfect!"
6324,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Adapt-a-Track (2 Pieces),0/1,5.0,"Great addition the Thomas Wooden Railway collection. It was a much needed addition, as tracks do not always match up when building a route."

6326,Ferrero Duplo Wafers with Hazelnut Cream,0/0,5.0,These were simply amazing. They were small in size but just enough to satisfy that sweet tooth or chocolate craving you're having. The taste is smooth and not overpowering like you would get from most chocolate bars here in the states. I've become a definite fan of these and I will be buying more for sure.
6327,"Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shave, 1 razor",0/0,1.0,"Unbelievable how this product can get the positive reviews that it did, but everyone has a different head shape and hair type. Short and to the point, I looked like I was on the losing end of a knife fight. Many nicks and cuts and a nickel size gouge on the bump at the back of my head. If you still want to try this, have a stypic pencil on hand, you will need it."

Labels are printed with spices and herbs, and there were a lot more than I thought! Space on the top can hold 5/6 more regular jars of spices/herbs. Huge space saver--might get another!"
6332,Support - Elbow - Epi-Lock,0/0,4.0,"I think this product was pictured as black when I ordered it, so I assumed it would be black. When it arrived, it was sort of tan, or beige, which is OK with me, but if I'd wanted it in black, it might be a different story. Other than that it was as I expected & it arrived in a timely manner, in excellent condition."
6333,Koon Chun Hoisin Sauce - 15 oz jar x 2,0/0,4.0,I make sauce for fried tofu. The product comes with a decent expiration. It doesn't look like it has been sitting on a shelf for ten years. The taste is good; a little too sweet.

6335,Kelsyus Inflatable Floating Chair,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love this brand of floaties! I have four, two different styles, and highly recommend them. We use them at the lake and they are so incredibly comfortable and durable. Well worth the extra bucks."
6336,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,4.0,"Baby loves to bounce in this thing and it keeps him entertained for a while. It's pretty well built and appears to be durable. It was fairly easy to assemble...probably took less than 30 minutes. We put a pillow underneath his legs so he can bounce a little better, otherwise he's on his tippy toes. I didn't give it 5 stars because one of the springs appears to have been preassembled backwards which makes the seat a little bit unbalanced on one side. It's not a big deal and I'm not concerned that they bouncer will topple over. I wish all the supporting bars had a toy hanging off of it instead of just the two because the baby likes to look up and reach for them."
6337,North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate,0/0,1.0,"Upon installation the gate lock pushes out causing it to bow out making it very difficult to step over, (after a week or so it was bowed out over 6 inches). Upon taking it out it ripped the paint off of my wall down to the drywall..."
6338,Nature's Way B-100 Complex,2/2,5.0,"My doctor made me a list of supplements she would higly recommend for my thyroid and hormone issues and other health issues.

6339,Melissa & Doug Giant Fire Truck Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"It's not quite wood, but it's pretty tough, thick card board, perfect for my 'all-boy' 4 year old. He's built and re built it a bunch of times now. For the price, it's a good value."

6342,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,0/0,4.0,The stairs seem durable enough... it looks cheap though. Serves it's purpose and washes easily because it's made of plastic.
6343,"Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)",1/3,2.0,"Well I guess in Brazil you can label something 100% Pure Coconut Water. This trash tastes like cardboard packaging, and sugar and vitamin C added? I am sorry, that is not 100%. I was not expecting real coconut milk, I understand it has to be pasteurized and processed to an extent. I love fresh coconut milk, I have a machete to cut the top off a coconut. However I live in the DC Metro and fresh coconuts are not exactly cheap. I just thought this would be a good, quick reminder of the real thing to drink on the go and not a can of soda. They picture this with a straw, it comes with no straws. Not happy with this purchase, and I question the safety of the product, obviously highly processed in some ""factory"". I really do not understand where the 5 star ratings are coming from on this product. I love Amazon, they should not sell trash like this."
6344,Source Naturals Sodium Ascorbate Buffered C Crystals,0/0,4.0,as advertised will by again. Bought for My wife for her Health protocol. Cheaper than buying in town. Great Price
6345,Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,0/0,4.0,"My eyelashes aren't long, but aren't really too short either. They stick straight down so I've tried many curling products and this works best for me.The brush that came with it to clean any mascara off (since it is recommended to use after applying mascara)is great! It also cleans my eyelash comb or seperater really well. If you don't do this carefully you can curl your eyelashes in a really weird way which happened a couple times at first.It said not to use when wearing contacts, but when I use it before wearing contacts, then put my contacts in my eyelashes get a little wet and then my eyelashes go straight down again not to mention that there is some mascara on too. I tried using it while wearing contacts since you put on mascara before using the curler and it was fine. Contact wearers I'm not sure if it is 100% safe using it with your contacts in but I took a leap of faith and I think it's fine. Everybody is different so this might not work on some people's eyelashes. The one problem about this is that batteries need to be replace A LOT. This curler devours double A batteries within a week or two, but if you don't use it everyday it should last longer before the battery drains.Overall it works for me so I am happy with my purchase."
6346,Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS Game,0/0,4.0,"realy cool and vintage toy, but a bit hard (specially for little kids) to build the ring,for best play, it's better to fix the ring on a table."
6347,Heel Inc Traumeel,0/0,1.0,I was hoping this product would relieve the pain in my heel associated with Plantar Faciitis but I was disappointed. It really had no effect at all.Probably is more geared toward addressing muscle pain.

6351,"SportDOG WetlandHunter 400 Yard Remote Trainer, SD-400CAMO",0/0,5.0,"I was kind of hesitant before I bought this since for me it was somewhat pricey but the quality is great! Both the collar and remote are waterproof, at least in 3 feet of water for sure. I decided to try it on myself mainly because I love my dog and with the dial cranked up to max I gave myself a nick and whooooo its like a strong whack from a cattle fence but not damaging. The charger is nice since there is no dock and no space hogging big black box at the plug, just a standard plug.The kit comes with receiver and collar attached but removable if need to be replaced (Collar comes very long but is easily trimmed, EASILY fit my full grown lab), Also comes with nice thick lanyard for the remote, a tester to ensure collar is working, extra hardware, instructional training dvd and training book,and operating instructions, The 400 yard distance can be realized but only in a field with no obstructions and good line of sight holding remote high, but does go very far. There are three buttons, one is an audio tone one is a quick nick and then the solid shock. Works great so far, the dogs not a huge fan thou!"

This heating pad is exactly as stated in your description and exactly what I was looking for. I have considerable back and leg pain, which cold and chill exacerbates, and this pad is flexible and comfortable and large enough to accommodate any situation. It is far and away the best heating pad I have ever owned. It has the automatic shutoff feature which is fantastic. I must say that on chilly nights, my cats enjoy it as well. Highly Recommend."
6357,"Helen of Troy 3/4"" Rotating Hot Air Brush",0/0,4.0,I have used this and sold several in my beauty salon for years and love it-don't like that when it gets older and hot it turns itself off-but guess that is a safety feature--Amazon is the ONLY resource for the 3/4 inch size--
6358,Bachmann Trains Snap-Fit E-Z Track Nickel Silver Layout Expander Set,0/0,2.0,"This is a minimal add-on kit that assumes the purchaser already has an 18"" radius track on which to add. The diagrams on the box are misleading if one assumes that one can build any of the track layouts without any previous 18"" radius track layout. Generally, I really like Bachmann products. The nickel-silver E-Z track concept is unequalled. The ad should clearly indicate that this is an add-on if the prospective buyer already has a compatible 18"" radius set up. I understand what ""expander"" implies. It is not readily apparent, however, that one needs to have already purchased a few hundred dollars in 18* radius track."
6359,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,I love it and would tell friends about it. I will get more lately. I have nothing else to say.
6360,Ultra Stomp Rocket,0/0,5.0,This is easy to set up and very kid friendly. The whole family had a fun time seeing how high we could get our rockets.
6361,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,5.0,This is one of my all time favorite movies from when i was growing up and i bought it for my kids to be able to watch.
6362,DermaPet Malacetic Otic AP - 16 oz,0/0,5.0,"We have Vizslas at home with chonic ear infections. They love water and their long ears tend to hold the water and they are susceptible to infection. We tried antibiotics and other vet recommended salves and balms, but the best preventative method is a flush with Malacetic Otic at least twice a week and up to daily.I personally don't like the smell, but its effective and that's what really matters for my pups.We pull back the ear flap and squirt a small amount directly into the ear canal. We hold the dog's head and massage the base of the ear for about 30 seconds to loosen the wax. Let the dog shake it out and break it up (may want to do this outside if there's a lot of build up). Wipe inside the ear flap and just inside the canal with cotton wool (we unroll cotton balls). Poke as deep as you and the dog are comfortable."
6363,Ruby Stone Nail File,0/0,5.0,My daughters and I love these and I was happy to find them- not in drugstores anymore. They were very popular stocking stuffers. Ruby Stone is long lasting and gentle on nails. Yes they don't feel as raspy as regular emory boards but that is what makes them perfect. I wouldn't use them to file down long length- that would take forever. But clip nails to desired length and these are ideal to smooth and shape. Also occasionally rinse them or smack them against something soft to get nail dust off and they will last forever!

6365,Dj Orthopedics Dj Orthopedics Vinyl Covered Neck Contour Blue Cold Therapy,0/0,5.0,"It gets and stays VERY cold for well past the required 20 minutes, which makes this much more effective than other similar cold packs that I have used.Flexibility is great, so you can really wrap it tight and get good contact with the skin. This is great benefit of gel packs.Tips"
6366,"Nature's Answer Passionflower Standardized, 60-Count",0/0,4.0,"I wouldn't give this a 5 star rating because it doesn't work 100% I do feel a difference when taking it, a more calm state of mind. It also makes me sleep pretty well. This product would be best used for sleeping not anxiety I think, but you never know everyone is different."
6367,Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 Complete Nutrition Shampoo For Dry and Sensitised Hair,0/0,5.0,"A wonderful product. It's pricey and hard to find but ladies, we are worth it. Especially for those who are menopausal who need skin, hair and nails TLC!"

6370,Lupine Designer Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,The Lupine collars are the best on the market. I bought this one for my 100 pound sheperd/chow mix and it fits around his fat fluffy neck comfortably (although extended pretty far out). I've stuck with lupine products for over 5 years and have only had to replace one leash in that time. I would highly recommend these.
6371,Carson-Dellosa Publishing Sign Language,0/0,5.0,bought it for my son so he can play and learn sign lanuage.. he loved it so muchthis came fast shipped..

6375,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,"Love this! My 8.5 month old refused to use his legs to attempt standing until he got this toy for Christmas. Now, he loves standing and holding on or sitting and playing with all the features & standing was 100% thanks to this learner toy. Great toy & already hours of great fun!"
6376,Jessica McClintock Eau de Parfum,1/1,1.0,"I purchased this perfume for a friend as a gift. A few days after I gave my friend this perfume she called to ask me where I purchased it from so she could return/exchange it due to it smelling - OLD, MUSTY, and SOUR. I am mortified and embarrassed. I don't see anywhere on here where I can talk to the seller or ask for a replacement or refund. Needless to say, I will not be ordering again. I am highly disappointed. :("
6377,Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy,1/1,3.0,This is a great idea though our golden retriever grew impatient. I think it was more attractive to chew on the spiky ball end and the rope. Great concept but we've owned two and the kibble didn't seem to come out as easily as it sounded and our dog grew bored waiting for something to fall out. Also our second unit the rope unravelled on its' own after the second use.
6378,Twining English Breakfast Tea (6 Pack),1/1,5.0,"This is my go to tea. I can't start my morning without and I insist on taking it with me on my travels (I swear to gawd if someone offers me Lipton's one more time...). Twinings isn't always available my local grocery stores so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have it directly sent to my home in bulk. Recommended, y'all."

6381,Drakkar Noir Cologne by Guy Laroche for men Colognes,0/0,4.0,"I like it, but it seems more &#34;old school&#34; to me...I was looking for something sweeter and fresher....but it will get used every now and then."
6382,"Now Foods, Sweet Almond Oil",0/0,5.0,"I trust the brand now foods, which is highly used and recommended. I love this oil, it's thick but not too thick like castor oil, I rate this number 3 due to it not being thick like castor oil, but not because it is not good quality. It's great for my hair, shine, nutrients, and beauty. I also like this oil because its natural and 100%pure."
6383,"I.M. Healthy Soynut Butter, Original Creamy, 15-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I started eating this because I was allergic to peanuts. It is very good and now that I found out I outgrew my allergy I prefer it to peanut butter. This deal is much more affordable than buying one jar at a time at the supermarket.

6385,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,5.0,"Simple and solid! Nothing else like it. The only thing I would ever buy to replace it , might be a straight razor. Just for kicks."
6386,Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue,0/0,2.0,This particular scent is weak and doesn't last long. My wife said she would never order this particular scent again.
6387,Melissa & Doug Giraffe Plush,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my 1 year old nephew for Xmas, thinking the others were too old. Well, my 6 year old nephew wouldn't stop climbing this thing. He beat it up pretty well, and it took it. Worth the purchase."
6388,Lupine Designer Dog Lead,0/0,5.0,"What more can you ask for? This lead and ALL Lupine products are guaranteed for life, even if chewed up!!! I love the look of the lead and the padded handle is so comfortable! Great product, and no problems at all!!!"
6389,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,I love this product. My husband and I are finally sleeping through the night. I would highly recommend this product!
6390,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"When our 5 year old niece opened this gift, she screamed, &#34;look mommy and daddy, I got ONE!!!&#34; Two weeks after Christmas, this is still one of her favorite gifts!!!"
6391,Carex Bed Buddy Joint Wrap (2-Pack),0/0,5.0,"This Joint wrap is the best product I've come across for people who suffer any kind of joint, neck, shoulder, or lower back pain. You just pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds, turn it over and 30 seconds again, and you have nice warm moist heat for at least an hour. It is so soothing for joint pain, I even tried it on my German Shepherd with hip dysplacia and he thouroughly enjoyed it because it put him right into a deep sleep. Then I tried it on my hyper female GSD who has a very hard time relaxing, I put it on her hip area and she also fell into a very deep trance and then she fell into a deep sleep. This is so unusual for her to be this relaxed, and I am happy to say it works just as well on humans!! The price is right on Amazon, and I couldn't find this product in any retail stores!"
6392,Magna-Tiles Clear Colors 100 Piece Set,0/0,5.0,"I have two kids (2 and 3 year old), and they both love playing with these magnetic tiles! It fosters their creativity since they can build anything from rocket ships, castles, to an ice cream cone, etc. Even though it is a bit pricey, having 100 pieces is worth the money because they can build more things with it (i.e. higher and bigger towers) and both kids can play with it without fighting over the pieces. It is a durable product, good for cognitive development, encourages creativity, and most of all fun!"
6393,"Radio Flyer 2700Z Pathfinder Wagon, Red",0/0,3.0,"We bought this product for our 16 month old and we also have one on the way, hence the two-seater. This was a Christmas present so we did not attempt to assemble it until Christmas Eve (bad decision in hindsight). We were missing a washer that is vital to the assembly of the wheels. The instructions only have pictures, and unfortunately, the pictures have not been updated with the same parts as the ones sent to us. It seems that it was arts and crafts time at the plant and the person responsible for making the drawings had never actually seen the product or attempted to assemble. The handle may have been the single most annoying and hard to put together item- my husband, not a small man, had to use every bit of his energy to push the handle into place.Overall, once the wagon was put together, it's great. My only gripe is the missing parts and terrible assembly instructions"
6394,"Emulsified Dry Vitamin A 25,000 IU - 60 - Capsule",1/1,5.0,"I bought this for my husband, I researched the best &#34;A&#34; that would be bio-available to our bodies. and this seem to one. My husband likes it."
6395,Nail Tek Crystal File with Free Companion Case Purple,0/0,5.0,I am so pleased. My sister had two nail tek files. One was just like this. The other was very coarse and I didn't care for it. This is a fine grit but shapes and repairs your nails. Can't tell you enough how much I like it. Bought the purse size as well.
6396,Hot Sock Diffuser,0/0,5.0,"Instead of the big round plastic diffuser, this is awesome. I would think if you have lots and lots of hair and you use this hot sock, it might take a while. My hair's fine so it works for me."
6397,OXO Good Grips Grout Brush,0/0,5.0,"This is an excellent accessory to go along with your McCullough Steam Cleaner. Even if you don't have the steam cleaner, they are better than a tooth brush on grout."
6398,Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue,0/0,5.0,I get compliments on this scent everywhere I go both from males and females. It's really a perfect everyday perfume that's not heavy nor lingers.
6399,"Almay Line Smoothing Makeup with SPF 15, 1 fl oz (30 ml) - (VARIED COLORS)",0/0,5.0,"once more so pleased to be able to recieve this product. am thrilled , it arrived on time andpackageing was wonderful."
6400,Por Kwan brand Thai Ice Tea Mix - 16 oz,0/0,5.0,"This is great stuff - the right [ie, real] tea, spices and that's it. Easy to use, beautiful orang-ie color of the tea you get in Thai restaurants and it makes a wonderful iced brew."
6401,Rain or Shine Kids Woobee Plush Blanket,0/0,3.0,"I ordered tangerine/grey, but for some reason received brown and green. This blanket is small. It's not ideal for a toddler, but probably just fine for a small baby. It is also thinner than I expected. However, I do like that one side is waterproof and the other side is soft."
6402,Elasto Gel Hot / Cold Sinus Mask,0/0,5.0,is true..will not take them away but help you alot to go thru.. i just love them!! recommended i bought 2 so i will always have one cold!
6403,"Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb.",0/0,5.0,"Works well and tastes the same as the same stuff I buy from whole foods, only this one is about half the price. Great low carb and gluten free baking kitchen staple."
6404,"Cardinal Gates Patio Door Guardian, White",0/0,5.0,"Very solid, very secure. Keeps the kids inside, everybody else outside. The vent position allows for fresh air and the gap is small enough to prevent the kids from slipping out, however the cat does slip through. Can pull and turn lock to disable. If you forget to do this and the kids close the door behind you, you are very securely locked out of the house."
6405,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",0/0,5.0,This will be perfect for our travels. It is compact and you can control the volume. We have been using it for a few weeks and it appears to be a great purchase.
6406,Gingerlily Theraphy Perfume by Coty for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,4.0,Small bottle nice for easy storage. Niice fragrance not too heavy.
6407,Reizen RL 350 Braille Labeler,0/0,5.0,I had a braille r and broke it because I used it alot for my blind grand sons toys. This is handy and easy to use.

6410,Sanitary Pants,0/0,5.0,"My puppy went into heat at a very young age right in the middle of a family vacation in a house full of people and dogs. She had been scheduled to be spayed and I had never dealt with such a thing before. I bought this garment for her at a pet supply store. Per the advice of the pet store expert, I bought regular human pantie liners and cut them down to go inside. This garment was the smallest and most discrete, yet we never had any problems. Puppy did not object to it and comes readily to me when I am holding it, as long as she gets her treat! Rinses easily. I am on Amazon to buy a backup so I can have a fresh garment prepped and waiting for her when we return from walks."
6411,Livatone Plus 240 Caps,0/0,3.0,"I am skeptical of this. We did not see any change in my husbands levels. I would like to for him to try again to double check. But, it is hard to spend money on something you aren't impressed with."
6412,"Conair SU1W Sound Therapy, Silver",0/0,1.0,I had the exact same problems with the second product product as I did with the first one Amazon shipped to me.It keeps intermittently making a harsh buzzing sound when it is turned on. How is this thing supposed to help someone sleep when it keeps making sounds akin to a blown stereo speaker? I would not recommend this product.
6413,100% Organic West African Shea Butter,0/0,5.0,"The photo above is a little misleading because it doesn't show the butter, just what it comes from. But the butter was a good quality and consistency, and a good ingredient for the lotion bars I made. Thank you!"
6414,HEAT WAVE Instant Reusable Heat Pack HAND WARMERS - 4 pack = 2 pairs Heat Wave; PLUS FREE CARRYING/STORAGE CASE,0/0,5.0,This is a great product that works well for cold weather camping or muscle pain. I realy like the fact that it is reusable.
6415,Monopoly - The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition,0/0,5.0,"best. game. ever. many great monopoly editions out there, but this one is the best, and I like the middle earth background on the board as apposed to the actor's faces"
6416,Ultra Stomp Rocket,0/0,5.0,This is so simple I bought it for all four of my children for Christmas. Even my two year old girl loved this one.... literally for hours. I would buy this one again.
6417,Tall-Ette Extra Wide Toilet Seat with Arms and Legs,1/1,4.0,"This item works well for my father who needs the steadiness and supportive handles plus raised seat when he visits outside of assisted living. He would like the seat to be higher, but the handles give him something to brace himself with when sitting and rising. It is sturdy and stable, easy to remove from the toilet. I also appreciate that there is no gap between it and the toilet itself. Some toilet seats allow urine to get out between the seat and toilet base. It also will fit both round and oval toilets."
6418,"Toysmith 3.5"" Small Voice Changer # 1378 - Colors May Vary",0/0,3.0,I had tried to order another voice changer but it was unavailable so I ordered the Toysmith 3.5&#34; small Voice Changer #1378 instead. It did not do as much as I thought it would do but my grandchildren played with it. I was disappointed in it.
6419,Bachmann 5 Inch Straight Track (6/Card) - N Scale,0/0,5.0,These track sections are of the same quality as the track in the sets. The plastic roadbed locks the sections together so the metal clips can do their job of carrying electricity. Well made. ... Mark
6420,Prince Of Peace Ginkgo Biloba & Red Panax Ginseng Extract,1/1,4.0,Really notice a difference and have come to enjoy one with breakfast each morning. Only difficulty is getting the vials open! I wish the company would change packaging to some sort of pop top!
6421,Shiseido Powdery Foundation (Refill),0/0,5.0,I was so glad to see this product again. I have used it for many years and it was becoming hard to find.I would buy this again!
6422,"iOSAT Potassium Iodide Tablets, 130 mg (14 Tablets)",0/0,5.0,"I hope I never need to use these, but it feels safer to have them. We live by a power plant and the local schools have these on hand in case of an emergency so I thought if they are thinking ahead for the welfare of my kids, then I should too."
6423,"Microflex MF300XL Powder Free Diamond Grip Latex Gloves Size Extra Large, 100 Box",0/0,5.0,XL is sized right. Alway has been a problem finding disposibles that fit. These do the trick and are strong too.
6424,"Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, Black",0/0,4.0,"I have pretty straight hair and every now and then like a different look. I have tried regular curling irons (1 inch and 1.5 inch); the curls are good but they don't last long and I on't get soft curls with those. This is a great product for soft curls or smoothing out hair in the morning. Best part is, the curls last much longer compared to the regular curling irons. Only thing I would have loved to see in this product is a better brush, this brush is not bad at all, but my hair slip out of it while curling as the teeth are smaller than expected. With loner teeth I guess this would be an ideal product for me :)"
6425,Canidae Dry Dog Food,0/0,5.0,"ROCKY my german shepherd puppy really loves these food,before I got him they were feeding him pedegree and I wanted to give him good quality food and I'm not disappointed at all."

6427,Webkinz Dalmatian,0/0,5.0,This dalmation puppy is very cute and was as we expected. It was shipped and arrived quickly before the holidays.
6428,Dr. Bronner's Lavender Soap Gallon,0/0,5.0,"If you aren't familiar with Dr. Bronner's soap, you're missing out on a natural, effective all-purpose cleaning product. I use it to wash my face, body, clothes, dishes, and countertops. I recommend buying a smaller size along with the gallon so you can refill it and easily move it from room to room - much easier than lugging around that heavy gallon bottle. The lavender scent is evident, but not overpowering. It leaves behind a pleasant relaxing fragrance - all natural of course. A little goes a long way - I dilute it heavily when cleaning the kitchen or bathroom. While Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap is my favorite of the line, the lavender is a close second."
6429,Melissa & Doug Victorian Doll Family,0/0,4.0,The dolls were made well and well detailed. They look sturdy and can stand up to my 7 year old granddaughters playing.

6434,Inuyasha Kirara Ear Headband,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my son's cat costume. He is 3. It fits well and he loves to wear it.
6435,"Petmate Ultimate Litter Scoop 22972, Colors may Vary",0/0,5.0,"I scoop three litter boxes daily - many times twice daily. I use Swheat Scoop litter. This is the best scooper I've used so far. While the handle could be a tad bit longer, it is long enough for not too much bending on my part. The material is strong enough to scoop to the bottom of the litter box and pull up any clumped litter clinging to the bottom of the box easily.The scoop strainer has large enough holes so that the litter sifts more quickly (so I don't have to spend forever shaking the scooper to separate the clumps and let the unused litter fall through.) I can see how some folks can say the holes are too big, but for my kitties' droppings, this is perfect.Mine came in the blue color, which i liked because it matches the litter box ... but really not a big deal. I really appreciate it.I also use the Litter Genie (bought in pet store - not online). I like the Litter Genie because it keeps the litter discard smells trapped. The size was better when I only scooped one box, but with three, it tends to fill up fast. I've jerry-rigged the top half of the Litter Genie to sit on top of a taller garbage container so the bag can extend longer and catch more discard. Works for me so far. I highly recommend the Litter Genie to help with smells. i have a sensitive nose and no longer smell box odors when I walk in my small apartment. Yay."
6436,Merkur Progress Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor with Pack of 10 Blades-#570- Made in Germany,0/1,1.0,"I thought the head was going to be adjustable and not the handle, so it wasn't what I was wanting at all."
6437,"BSN Noxplode 2.0, 2.48 Pounds",66/69,5.0,"Since I got heavy into weightlifting, I've been taking the BSN brands. I've always been pleased with the results. My gains are great, my fatigue is minimal and my overall performance is peak. I recently switched gyms and one of my fellow weightlifters inspired me to add to my supplement mix. Boy am I glad I took his advice.The driving force behind NO-Xplode, and all NO Boosters, is an amino acid called L-Arginine. This is what really pumps the blood into the muscles and gives you that pumped feeling. I've been actually adding straight L-Arginine (L Arginine (1 Kg) (2.2 Lbs) Bulk Powder) into the Xplode and have taken things to whole another level. My body hasn't developed any immunity to these supplements in the three months since I started this routine which is perfect because usually my body will adapt to whatever I'm taking pretty quickly."
6438,Fake Barf,0/0,1.0,"I put it in my mouth made throw up sounds and spit it out so when they came around the couch and saw it on the floor thought they might fall for it but nobody did,....ti was obviously fake looking. not worht a penny. don't buy it"

6441,Real Theater All Inclusive Popcorn Popping Kits 27.5 Ounce box (Pack of 4),0/0,3.0,"I expected the popcorn to be packaged as displayed/described in packs of 4, but they were all in one big padded envelop - looked sloppy and to be honest, I don't even know if I received all the packs I was to - just bever got the time before Christmas to dump them out and repackage them."
6442,Energizer ECR2430BP Lithium 3-Volt Coin Cell Battery,0/0,3.0,"Wrong size received but for the minimal price, not worth fooling with so hope I find a use for the size I did get. Had to reorder as this size showing is what I needed for my scale."
6443,Maxim Wooden Animal Train Set - 7 Piece,0/0,4.0,"My grandson liked it, but it was an unnecessary purchase since the Kid Kraft bucket set already had trains in it."
6444,Melissa & Doug Learn-To-Play Piano,0/0,5.0,"LIked the reveiws before I bought it for my 2 year old grandkids. Ir's made of wood and very colorful. Both of the children are enjoying playing the piano, since they do not have a real one at home."

6447,"Stila Eye Shadow Pans, Twig, 0.09 Ounce",0/0,5.0,I have used this eyeshadow for years and this particular color has worked well on any of my friends. It has enough color so it does not look white but not so much color that it darkens your eye. I use it for a base color. BTW light skin and freckles.

6449,Stainless Steel Hanging Pet Bowl,0/0,4.0,My dog likes to knock it around so I used 4 zip ties to secure the everything in place and now he can't spill it anymore.
6450,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",0/0,5.0,"This is great for on the go, knowing we may need it when we're out and about! Even if we have a fully charged unit!"
6451,Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Pads,0/0,2.0,"I was really excited about this product with the one review it had. I'm not impressed. I've used it for 2 weeks straight. No difference in skin tone, texture, etc. It's just sticky. Do not put it on your neck...ick! Waste of money...I should have know better just to stick with my ProActiv."
6452,"Uma Appaloosa Horse 9"" by Douglas Cuddle Toys",0/0,5.0,Finally found this cute plushie! Have been searcing for it for more than a year and was lucky enough to get one of them.
6453,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"My wife loves this polish and the color although a bit dark, it looks great on her. Has a nice shimmer to it."
6454,Bvlgari BLV Pour Homme Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,I have bought this fragrance for my husband before and we both really love it. It is a clean masculine scent. The price was excellent! I got double the amount for 50% of the price at regular walk-in stores. Very satisfied!
6455,ETERNITY for men by Calvin Klein,0/0,5.0,I loved it a lot. I sent it to my baby and he told me that's the best gift ever.
6456,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,1/1,4.0,"I wanted a coat that was easy to put on my puggle (so my husband wouldn't whine about what a pain it is to put a coat on the dog when they go for walks). My puggle is a little on the husky side (between 25-30 pounds) and most &#34;mediums&#34; are just a little too small. I bought the large which is just a little too big, but it does the trick. She hates the coat, but I think it does a good job keeping her warm and dry on her winter walks."
6457,"Revlon LipGlide Full Color + Shine, Apricot Glaze 170, 0.06 fl oz (1.9 ml)",0/0,5.0,"Although I consider this a superior lip gloss, Revlon no longer has this in their line of cosmetics. I was fortunate enough to find some on your site, but it is no longer available on your site or anywhere else."
6458,MineralRich 32 fl oz Liquid by Maximum Living,2/2,5.0,"cant wait to see the results a month later... I already know this is going to be a reat buy with the natural supplements and minerals that will help my skin, nails and hair since I dont like taking pills this will work very well...."
6459,Salon Bronze Airbrush Tanning System,1/1,2.0,Bought this because my friend swore it was great. I had my boyfriend apply it in the shower it applied terribly the nozzle is terrible and it came out watery and kept running everytime we sprayed. To get my entire body what I thought was evenly it took an entire cartridge. I waited 24 hrs and saw I was spotty. If it sprayed correctly I would like it. I had to also rub most of it in lightly with a paper towel bc i was covered in dripping brown liquid.Be careful when spraying ur feet I didn't put much on them and they still came out blotchy orange. You are literally paying for a plastic gun that pushes on the nozzle of the bottle to get it to come out and the tanner. This is not something u can spray by yourself. Make sure you do it in the tub bc it is messy but washes off without a problem. Also it has that typical self tanner smell which I don't mind but some people do. It will stain your nails so be careful with them. The spots that were even looked pretty nice but that's the difficult part about this stuff is getting even coverage.
6460,Eros Original Bodyglide Silicone Lubricant,0/0,5.0,"I have been using this lube for years and I cannot use anything else. It feels so natural and pleasent, it lasts forever during intercourse. Best part is a small drop goes along way, this lube is seriously revolutionary! Do not look at the price or any bad reviews, this stuff is just simply amazing!"
6461,Take-A-Part Vehicle Building Toy Set,0/0,5.0,my grandson loved ithe has played with it everyday since he loves taking it apart and putting it back together again.
6462,Brushtech Sports Bottle Straw Washing Brush B23C,0/0,5.0,Makes cleaning reusable straws really easy. Feel better using the reusable straws knowing they are more sanitary. Like this brush a lot
6463,Gund Arnold the Snoring Pig by Gundfun,0/0,5.0,"My mom collects pigs and when I saw this I knew I had to get it for her for Christmas. It was very soft, well-made and was a big hit. When you press his front paw, he snores . . . making a wee, wee, wee sound as he exhales. It was hilarious! All the family that was there when she opened it got a good laugh."
6464,Source Naturals N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine 300mg,0/0,5.0,This type absorbs faster and better than the regular L-tyrosine. I did notice a difference. I buy it whenever it's available.
6465,Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,0/0,5.0,"We purchased this swing in 2009 for our first baby, mainly because it was one of the only ones available at the time that plugged into the wall. Three years and two babies later it's still working like new and I'm giving it to my sister for her new baby. The cover is easily removed and washes beautifully, the little mobile animals can be spot cleaned. It's pretty quiet, but it does have a bit of motor noise- both my kids actually found that soothing. There are variable volume settings, as well as different music and rainforest noises. The mobile also has an independent on and off switch, which was nice when I wanted the mobile on for them to look at, but not the music. It's easily taken apart for storage, but it's not a great option for a lot of car transport, as it's pretty big. We set it up in a quiet corner of our family room and occasionally moved it around the house. It does fold up to get through doors, so moving it throughout the house is no problem. Both of our sons were on the large side, and this swing handled their weight and length just fine. We found this swing to be one of the best baby purchases we made."
6466,Pretty Pretty Princess Dress-Up Board Game,0/0,4.0,"Got this for my 3yr. Old grand-daughter for Christmas. Very hard to find & very pricey. The original game had an actual board, this one does not. I bought it for sentimental reasons, so I was ok with the $$. Couldn't find it in stores anywhere."
6467,Burberry London By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces (new),0/0,5.0,The absolute best and long lasting. I am asked quite often &#34;what do you have on&#34; I have passed the website to my friend
6468,No Scream Cream Relax and Wax,0/0,5.0,How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg. The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg. I would never wax without this again.
6469,"Skippy Peanut Butter, Creamy, 40Ounce",0/0,5.0,"It's genuine skippy butter. The only thing I'm unsure about is the price. I paid 6.18 after shipping using the 'add-on' function. I'm not sure how that compares to in-store prices, but I was getting some stuff anyway so I figured, what the heck."
6470,Melissa and Doug Basic Skills Board,0/0,5.0,Excellent quality. We were so impressed with it we just ordered another one for our daughters family. Melissa and Doug products are great.
6471,Bare Escentuals bareMinerals Blush,0/0,5.0,"goes on easy, so natural looking and stays on all day. I love this brand and this shade. So do others as it is sometimes hard to find at retail."
6472,Clairol Beautiful Collection Semi-Permanent Hair Color,0/0,5.0,I like this product because it is the closest thing to the loving care that was discontinued. I can't use certain dyes because I am allergic to ppd in hair colors. So this is great.
6473,"Albolene Cleansing Concentrate Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser, Unscented - 12 oz",0/0,5.0,"I ordered this for my mother, after she had surgery. The doctor told her it was good for her scars. She loves it."
6474,"Orly Nail Lacquer, 06 Fluid Ounce",0/1,5.0,"Pretty nail polish, very sensitive nail polish. Chips easy and it shows uneven nail painting layers but is still pretty. Do not use with a clear top coat."
6475,Jaybird and Mais MOLESKIN Moleskin Roll (2 in. wide),0/0,5.0,"Bought it in order to be able to not only put some of it into our bug out bags, but also in order to have extras. Definitely a must have item if you're doing anything where you will be away from home walking a lot. It works great for small get home car kits too."
6476,Tolo Toys Rainbow Stackers,0/0,5.0,I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas this year (she just turned 11 months old on December 30th) and she's been carrying them everywhere with her since she opened them up! She loves to gnaw on them (there still aren't any teeth marks in the plastic after 2 weeks of abuse) and slam them on the kitchen floor. Overall a great toy to occupy your little one's fleeting attention span!
6477,No Stress Chess,0/0,4.0,"I love that you can use either side, my 6 year old grandson and I really enjoyed it, great way to start the game"
6478,"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",1/1,3.0,This monitor gets the job done (most of the time) but it is VERY sensitive. We had a cell phone plugged in the next room over and it went crazy with static! Flipping certain lights on and off in the house will cause it to make a sound. We tried to use batteries vs plugging it in but it ate right through them in one night! We have a small house so we won't be upgrading anytime soon. I know the static/interference is a problem with many baby monitors but it is still annoying!
6479,Lumbar Support,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my mother and it is the best lumbar support in the market. The price is reasonable and the fit is very comfortable.
6480,"Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, 34"" x 52"", White",0/0,5.0,"These pads never leak, and they are just about the right size to throw into a crib. They are also very soft and comfortable."
6481,"Polo by Ralph Lauren for Men, Eau De Toilette Natural Pour",0/0,5.0,This is and always will be my favorite cologne. My husband loves it also! You just cant go wrong with this for a gift.
6482,"NATURE'S WAY, Valerian Root - 180 caps",0/0,5.0,Nature's Way is reputable brand that delivers what's promissed. I take one capsule before bed time and sleep 7-8 hours without interruption.
6483,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",0/0,5.0,A must if you have a leapPad or other leapster product (works on all the leapfrog products that have an a/c port).I wish it had a Velcro wrap thing to keep it neat when it's not in use. It was on sale at Christmas time for $5 so you can't beat that. I just tell the kids they have to plug in when they use their leapPads and we use batteries when we are on car trips. They have figured out where they can play and be close to an outlet.This doesn't recharge the batteries that are in the product. If you have a leapPad 2 you may want to consider the recharging cord and batteries instead of this product alone.
6484,The Laser Game,0/0,5.0,"Simple, sencillo y poderoso... Buen juego que contagia a quien lo experimenta, no importa si es de 8 a&ntilde;os o de 78 a&ntilde;os."
6485,Sing Along CD Player,1/1,1.0,"I am so disappointed in this toy. I was looking forward to my boy being able to play his own music, but it didn't even work Christmas morning. We put the batteries in, a cd, and pressed play, but nothing happened. The box was pitched before I could save it, so now I am stuck with a machine that does nothing."
6486,My First Uno Angelina Ballerina,0/0,1.0,"Wholesale freebies sent me this game without box and same card repeated. I complained and they sent me the same ,,!! Thing again just a different number repeated. I have not been refunded as of today. Not happy. My kids just want to play Angelina ballerina UNO,please fix this problem and send me a new game with a box!"
6487,KORALIA 2 UL 600 gph 9W,0/0,5.0,Great addition to my tank.This water pump really moves the water around.Currently using in a 75gal with a 2nd Koralia 1 + HOB + canister.Have already noticed a reduction in waste that used to gather in corners.Quiet and efficient.
6488,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,0/0,5.0,"Good color, comfy, good size for a big size of dog; easy to use and very easy to dirty. Good bed for interiors."
6489,Luster's S-Curl 360 Style Wave Control Pomade,0/0,5.0,"This had my waves spinning, i haven't had waves since i think 2006 and i am a lost cost for not buying this sooner. This product had my waves spinning and girls was all over me"
6490,Melatonin 2.5 mg (Liquid) by Natrol,0/0,5.0,"I take this melatonin fairly regularly, it tastes good and it makes it easy to fall asleep when your circadian rhythms get out of wack with little to no sun in the wintertime."
6491,Wit's End Board Game,0/0,4.0,I won a Round by just having good luck. I mean i clearly didn't know in which order three wars that happened decades before I was alive had occurred but it was fun trying to figure it out and getting it right.
6492,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,"best product ever! Soothes me to sleep at night, my cat loves it. the water always stays cold its a breeze to clean and refill. Cleaning takes a good half hour but i was expecting it to be annoying which it is not. Definitely the best pet fountain on the market"
6493,Percogesic Percogesic Aspirin Free Fever Reducer & Pain Releiver,0/0,1.0,"Unfortunately the company has taken out phenyltoloxamine from this product and replaced it with diphenhydramine (Benadryll), which doesn't work as well at all. However, phenytoloxamine and acetaminophen tablets ARE still available and fully legal. The brand name I found them under is Phenylgesic, and they have them at drugsdepot.com which is a legitimate old online pharmacy, look up the reviews. Hope this helps everyone."
6494,SprayShield Animal Deterrent Spray with Belt Clip,1/1,5.0,"I got this spray awhile ago and my friend accidentally tested it on me. I can personally say, that it does not burn your eyes at all and is merely quite startling. That is why I use it when absolutely necessary, basically to allow me to safely break up sporadic dog fights. I have never had a super aggressive animal to use it on, so it suits my needs just fine."
6495,Graco Ultra Clear 49MHZ Baby Monitor,0/0,5.0,Love that this has two handsets so you can have one in your room and one on the go around the house.I bought an additional charger so I could have three places in my house to plug into power.
6496,Classic Wizard Wand,0/0,5.0,"Great gifts for the Harry Potter fan. The sound is great, nice color. They seem to be holding up well under all the spells they have been casting."
6497,Body Back Buddy,0/0,4.0,"Bought this to help relieve pain from a pinched nerve, and it definitely helps. A little awkward looking so it's not great to take in to work, but it serves its purpose."
6498,Merial Frontline Top Spot Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,0/0,5.0,I've used Frontline for my dog for over ten years now and I don't have any complaints. We live in an area that is prone to ticks and they seem to have very little interest in biting my dog.
6499,Ravensburger Alphabet Zoop - Children's Game,0/0,4.0,"I bought two of these games for a two different grandson's that are 3 and 4 years old. They like the game, and so do their older brothers and sisters. A game they can play with the little ones is always appreciated."
6500,"PetzLife Oral Care Spray, Peppermint, 2.2 ounces",0/0,5.0,"I have used PETZLIFE products over the years with good results. On the nites I don't actually brush his teeth, I use this product, instead. Keep in mind, some dogs do not like sprays in their mouths. This particularly dog I have now, doesn't mind it. This is an excellent company and I will keep using their products."
6501,"Frownies Forehead & Between Eyes, 144 Patches",0/1,4.0,This product comes in a small neatly packaged box with instructions. The product itself is unbleached natural kraft paper with a natural water based adhesive. There are 144 pieces. I bought these to help prevent those vertical forehead lines . I usually just have to remind myself to relax my face or do a simple facial massage massage. However sometimes my forehead scrunches up automatically and I don't realize it. I wouldn't mind wearing these around the house during the day but bought them mainly for nighttime use. Because they are something you cannot cover up with makeup. I do sleep on my stomach so I also thought they might help with the sleeping on the face wrinkles. They are very simple to use. Make sure you have a clean face. Then take one or two or how ever many you need off of the perforated stack and dampen one at a time to activate the adhesive and place in desired spot(s). Be sure to press down for a few seconds or more to ensure a good stick. Perhaps I did not wet the product enough before putting them on as the very tips of the corners stuck up a little bit. Or it could jut be the stiffness of the product in conjunction with my forehead shape. I do know that Frownies has a rose water spray for activating the adhesive. They also have other shapes for different parts of the face. Overall I like the product and would recommend it to family and friends as a simple at home way to help keep facial muscles from creating unwanted creases.
6502,Heather's Tummy Tea Peppermint Tea Bags for Irritable Bowel Syndrome ~ Heather's Tummy Teas Organic Peppermint Teabags (36 Jumbo Teabags),0/0,5.0,My wife has used this product for years. We had one lot that had bugs in it and it was replaced immediately with no hassle. They had a problem with one shipment and it was replaced rapidly and with no hassles. The replacement was even sent priority!
6503,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,5.0,Just what I wanted! I do love it. No more bending over to put on makeup!!! Great value! Great Magnification!
6504,Travels Light Hot Air Balloon,1/1,5.0,"I bought the Green, Blue and Rainbow balloons for my 2 year old sons room where they hang from the ceiling in front of his 6' wide window. They are very well made and of high quality. The main balloon / orb is hard plastic and quite durable. My son dropped and kicked one the day they arrived without any damage. I had originally been looking at the larger models but due to their cost I decided on these and quite happy that I did! They look great in his room with a few white clouds on the ceiling over them, vintage airplanes on the walls and a few vintage model planes planned down the road. He enjoys looking over at them at night when going to bed and throughout the day points up saying balloons and fly and their colors now as well.Again these are very nice, high quality models that will not disappoint. If your looking and thinking of buying them just hit the purchase button and checkout. Enjoy!"
6505,Cardinal Industries Mexican Train Domino Game in an Aluminum Case,0/0,1.0,Also bought a double 12 set that said jumbo - wrong - was the thin type - returned and did get credit - have not been able to find the 3/8 inch thick ones - wrote cardinal but no answer - the thin 1/4 inch are useless for Mexican train dominoes
6506,Breyer Model Horse Paint Your Own Horse Activity Kit,0/0,4.0,Not as much paint as I would have liked but over all a great project and fun for a Breyer collector!
6507,Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,0/1,3.0,I love my hammock its great the wall mounts it came with were a little cheap and the picture makes u think its a little bigger than it really is but I'm satisfied
6508,"Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set, Normal/Dry Skin",0/0,5.0,"I have a very sensative skin which getting used to the same skin care line, so I have to change my routine every year. I used this mary Kay set - ot works great"
6509,,1/1,5.0,"perfect assistance to pull oneself up from a prone position to sitting, as well as allow one to slowly lie down without just flopping into place! really like that it goes under the mattress far enough to not pop out, too!"
6510,Cactus Games Scattergories-Bible Edition,0/0,5.0,Our family really enjoyed the challenge of the Bible edition. The game will really encourage us to pay closer attention to names and places as we read the Bible.
6511,"All Glass Aquarium AAG25920 Fluorescent Strip Light, 20-Inch",0/0,5.0,I was looking for a replacement fixture for my 35 Aqueon Hexagon tank. They don't tell you it fits this particular tank BUT it does. It arrived in an Aqueon box and pretty much was the same one I had before. So far so good.
6512,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,4.0,This pet toy is very cute. I showed it off to a couple of different friends and they both immediately ordered one from Amazon. The quality is excellent. Very detailed construction. The squirrels/chipmunks whatever you prefer are adorable. Our dog is a 70 pound German short hair that lives to tear all of the stuffing out of every toy we buy her. Immediately!! Most toys last less than an hour and then she carries around the pelt. She's been playing with these since Christmas and only this evening decided to rip into one of the squirrels but didn't really finish the job. He (the squirrel) is just sort of gimpy at the moment and holding on to a &#34;shred&#34; of his former self. She does like to chew on the lip of the stump now and then. Which I don't really think the manufacturer had in mind but she completely ignores me when I tell her that. Not sure how long it will last. Good product. We got it on sale before Christmas so good price as well.
6513,"Senseo Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,1.0,"The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach. The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups. Since then I have tried diluting each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists. I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era. NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE, EVER AGAIN!I don't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods. Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea. My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores, at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper!"
6514,Hanae Mori HM,0/0,5.0,"I first encountered this fragrance as a sampler and initially disliked it. It has a sweet character but not as abrasive as, say, Angel Man---similar but not quite as in your face and not as chemical. The top citrus notes are fresh and there is no getting around the overall complexity of the elements, especially the florals. Excellent longevity with a somewhat feminine dry down. Avoid over application so that you are not a scent 'bomb' for the first hour.This cologne, more-so than any other I've tried, evokes physical responses from people. They will either love it and want to 'eat you up' or they will look at you funny and perhaps sic a pit-bull on you.Good luck. Highly recommended."
6515,Convatec Convatec Aloe Vesta Protective Ointment,0/0,5.0,"I apply this over my hands that have dry, flaky eczema within minutes of exiting the shower, and it has helped bring the previously uncontrollable painful cracking under control. This is the best heavy cream to use for holding in moisture. Takes a few minutes to really absorb in to where you can comfortably handle things, but if you have major dryness issues like I do, this ointment is a godsend."
6516,Wood Checkers Set,0/1,1.0,This is a cardboard checkerboard with cheap wooden checkers. Misleading. I can see why they only show a picture of the box. There is a statement on the bottom of the ad that it includes dominoes and it doesn't. I would just not recommend this company at all.
6517,Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves,0/0,5.0,"could not live with out this product , literaly will heal a cracked heel over night , it's amazing , u just have to hand wash them , and they will last quit awahile , if u throw them in the washer they will fall apart"
6518,The Farmer Says,0/0,5.0,"This Christmas gift made the little 2 year old smile and she enjoyed playing with it on that day and continues to enjoy the gift! She also received the farm set, so it is particularly enjoyable for her."
6519,Melissa & Doug Shape Sorting Cube,0/0,1.0,The shape sorter is really cute but the edges are sharp and the paint in the shapes came off on my daughter. She only played with it once and I had to get rid of it. Be careful with this toy. I would nit purchase it for a child under three.
6520,"Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, Black",0/0,4.0,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She had used the one I previously owned and asked me to get her one if I ever saw it again. She really liked the way her hair was bouncy and retained the curl throughout our evening out. She has medium weight, chestnut brown hair with some wave. To avoid heat damaging your hair, I would suggest applying a moisturizing cream after shampooing and making sure your hair is dry before styling."
6521,AmeriColor Gel Paste,1/1,1.0,"I love AmeriColor, but instead of receiving the soft gel paste in brown I received AmeriColor Airbrush food color in brown. Not the same thing."
6522,iCellTech Size 312 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,1.0,"Stay away from this seller, as the batteries I bought lasted anywhere from 0 to 2 hours! So of 60 batteries, most were dying at the most inopportune times. What a waste."
6523,Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail,1/1,5.0,"Mom has fallen out of her bed twice now.We even removed the frame.She is 87 and has trouble getting up ,down and every place in between.I need to keep thinking of ways to keep her safe in my home.This bedrail is wonderful.I love the extra security of the bar that goes between the the mattress and box spring.It is also in just the right place to actually help her to get up out of bed easier."
6524,Giant Microbes Dust Mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) Plush Toy,1/1,4.0,"Purchased for my 3 year old niece because after seeing dust mites on a mattress commercial she was terrified to sleep in her bed.-_-WAY to go Sealy.ANYWAY, this little guy was so cute she is no longer afraid and he has a happy home in her room."
6525,"Grannick's Bitter Apple for Dogs Spray Bottle, 16 Ounces",0/0,5.0,"My puppy chewed on everything in my house, especially on cords. After using the bitter apple spray on the cords my dog has never chewed on them again. The spray works on various items such as rugs, pillows, bricks, wood, etc. Anything you don't want your dog to chew on, apply this spray and they will chew no more! You might have to re-apply the spray every couple of days at first."
6526,Calico Critters,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my friend's granddaughter for Christmas as well as the Calico Critters Nursery. Maya, 5, spent the night playing with them during my visit!"
6527,"Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count",0/0,5.0,"I bought this little hand pump when my oldest son was a couple weeks old and I was unable to nurse on one breast. I pumped that side everytime I nursed my son on the other, and it kept up my supply perfectly- there was no struggle when I was able to nurse on that side again. I've been looking into electric pumps (I'm not thrilled about my bulky/uncomfortable Medela pump-in-style) because this time around I want to build a bigger freezer stash, and I am considering buying a second Lansinoh hand pump because it just works so much better/faster. I just pumped 5 oz in about 10 minutes, which would take me just as long with my electric, pumping BOTH sides (as opposed to just one with the hand pump). This is a great little pump, inexpensive, and really easy to clean.Others commented about too many parts and/or too hard to dry-- perhaps it is the case, BUT I have talked with friends and with my own pumps, this is the case with ALL pumps. The reality here is that this Lansinoh pump is easy to disassemble and clean. and it really is NOT that hard to dry and it's not that time consuming (this means a lot as I have a 3 month old and a 16 month old- my time is precious).I also occasionally get hand cramps, but I suspect that would be the case with any/all manual pumps. I wouldn't fault Lansinoh on this at ALL.The soft shield that goes over the horn makes pumping so much more comfortable- no nipple pain or soreness at ALL.This pump is perfect for Stay-at-home moms who are looking to build a freezer stash. I haven't worked, but I imagine it would be quite perfect in the workplace as well... it's quiet and relatively small... and EFFICIENT.Love this pump- GREAT job Lansinoh."
6528,DKNY Be Delicious,0/0,5.0,"Was a Christmas gift for my wife, she was happy and that's what counts. Will likely try other scents as well."
6529,"Duracell Procell AA Batteries, 24-Count",0/0,5.0,"I was buying a bunch of LED lamp USB-devices with battery backups for holiday gifts, and each required AA batteries to function, and were not part of the packaging. Rather than make the recipients buy their own batteries -- and perhaps miss seeing them work when they opened them -- I supplied the needed batteries. These ones seemed to be a good buy, and I'm not disappointed once I see them!"

6534,Chelsea Pattern Wicker Nursery Hamper with Removable Bag Color,0/0,2.0,The item is misrepresented on Amazons website. This hamper is for a child and not for an adult. Now I have to return the item. Which means I have to spend money shipping it back and starting over to order the correct item. Which means spending more money. Amazon should say that it is a childs hamper like it said from Wayfair!! Unhappy
6535,Balanced B Complex,0/0,5.0,"Whole food vitamins are worth every penny, Can even take on an empty stomach if need be.Much better than the chemical based competitors..."
6536,"Tetra 26160 Whisper Bio-Bag Cartridge, Unassembled, Medium, 12-Pack",0/0,5.0,I used to buy the pre assembled Tetra filters and I really hesitate on getting these but they are exactly the same with the only difference that you have to assemble the filter by yourself. By the way the assembling part couldn't be easier.
6537,Herbal PF Herbal Cholestene,0/0,3.0,"Red Yeast Rice has reported cholesterol-lowering effects similar to RX statin drugs, but &#34;without the adverse side-effects.&#34; However, having had muscle pains with Lipitor and all the other RXs, I noted the same increase in muscle pain when taking RYR. At present I am only taking 1 cap every other day and have only minimal pain."
6538,"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Polka Dots",0/0,5.0,These blankets are the best swaddle blankets I've found. (Most are too small). I was able to swaddle my babies for up to 3 months with them. The fabric is great for cooler months to feel confident baby is cozy. ( they may be a little warm for summer months though)
6539,"Nailtiques Formula 2 Protein, .5 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I have been using this stuff forever. It is something that I cannot live without, I have even gotten my daughter using nailtiques."
6540,Bachmann Trains Overland Limited Ready - To - Run Ho Scale Train Set,0/0,1.0,Very disappointed with this set. The engine comes off the track every time it goes around. If the layout was bigger maybe it would not come off but the oval is tight and cannot support the large engine.
6541,"Garnier Nutrisse Haircolor, 100 Extra-light Natural Blonde Chamomile",1/1,3.0,"My hair turned out kind of a medium reddish-blond. I was trying to go to blond from light brown, though, so it was probably not the hair dyes fault. I can say that it does have a pleasant smell at first, before morphing into the usual horrid chemical scent."
6542,Webkinz Lion,0/0,5.0,Webkinz are awesome for both a physical stuffed animal and an online game center were you can play! My grandson loved it!
6543,Spring Blossom Barbie,0/0,3.0,"I ordered this doll as I like it as the picture shows, however, when i received it, it was a black barbie,and has serious 'scar' on the chest. Very disappointed. It is too cheap to return, and I am out of the country, so not bothered."
6544,OPI Malaga Wine Nail Lacquer,0/0,5.0,"If you know OPI and nail polish you'll love this color. It's a fantastic late summer, fall, early winter color. I wear it regularly."
6545,"Sunworks Construction Paper, Scarlet, 9 x 12; 50 Sheets; no. PAC6003",0/1,5.0,Gave to my niece to use with metallic crayons that are for black paper. Works very well and she is happy.

6549,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,Pampers are the best for your little ones. The diaper absorb the moisture very well and keep kids skin dry. Surely recommend it.
6550,Swede-O Trim Lok Ankle Brace,0/0,3.0,"I bought 2 of these for my daughter, but they are not comfortable to wear so she doesn't wear them - so that was a waste of money..."
6551,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,I found this on amazon just before we were planning to get a 600 dollar device put in my 7 year olds mouth to stop thumb sucking. We had tried everything! Just went to the orthodontist and dentist and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product. Her teeth have moved back a bit in the 3 months since she stopped! I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it. It may seem harsh but my daughter is really proud of herself.
6552,Source Naturals Optizinc Zinc Monomethionine 30mg,2/3,4.0,"I am using this to help prevent acne. I would give it 5 stars if it came in a not so chalky tablet. Even so, it appears to be well tolerated."

6556,ThinkFun Fifteen Puzzle,1/1,4.0,"My family has a side table in our living room with nothing but small puzzles and brain teasers. This puzzle was nice and a ton of fun. I don't like how some of the numbers easily pop up and come out of alignment when moving them around. Nice little snap case, and nice addition to our collection."
6557,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,My baby recently began walking and loves this item. It entertains her while she walks and when she is tired she can sit and play. Worth every penny.
6558,Clinique Different Lipstick,0/0,4.0,"color is a little sheerer than I like, but could be a perfect fit if you are looking for just a little bit of color. A nice, fairly natural shade of lipstick."

6561,Pirate Pop Gun,0/0,1.0,This was cheap but didn't work. I couldn't find info on the company it came from to return it. Not a good buy.
6562,Rainbow Light Dha Smart Essentials,0/0,2.0,"Disappointed when I read the FDA list from 2007 and found out that these contain lead(read the information for yourself- google &#34;fda list of vitamins containing lead)In fact these ranked in the top ten highest for lead content.. AND these are prenatals! I was shocked that any vitamin company, especially Rainbow Light would do this to prenatals, but after further research I've discovered that most prenatal vitamins contain lead.I was also unhappy about the addition of soybean oil in the DHA supplement.Makes me question the other Rainbow Light products I use."
6563,"Bakery on Main Gluten Free Granola, Rainforest Banana Nut, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Delicious gluten free cereal. We love the taste, crunch and flavor. It is very filling and good for any time of the day."
6564,Casual Canine Reflective Jacket,0/0,3.0,"I have a pappillon mix dog where his girth is 16&#34; and length is 18&#34; so went with the size chart and got the large since he was in the middle. If it was too long, I thought I could alter it but when I got it, it was meant for a lab size dog. And altering wasn't going to work. It was a soft fleece type of material. I ended up returning it. Wished it would of worked but found a different one at a store."

6567,Madina Licorice Stick Strawberry Flavor 1lb,0/0,5.0,"This is the true licorice. What is interesting is that every licorice product is made with these sticks. The commercial black twisted licorice products we find in grocery store have probably 1 or maybe 2 percent of extract of these raw sticks. These products have no medicinal effects for health. True licorice is very good for stomach issues [specially after eating too much during a party added with liquor] and the result is like magic, better than pharmaceuticals products. I gave it a 5 stars because the product is 100 % natural, well packed and it gives an option for people who try to get this natural product."
6568,Pour Homme,0/0,5.0,This is the ONLY cologne my son will wear and it is a very nice scent. So happy to find it online $20.00 cheaper than in our area! Great Christmas present!
6569,Eclectic Institute Inc Larix,0/0,5.0,"We started using this product about 6 months ago in conjunction with a chewable immune defence wafer and my son seems to be staying healthier this winter compared to the past. A friend of mine suggested it as her son also tends to be sick all winter. I mix it with fruit juice to get it in him, but he still complains because he still knows I put something in it. Ya do what you have to to get a healthy kid!"
6570,VTech - Learn and Discover Driver,0/0,5.0,"Lots of noise to keep my son entertained. Sings, talks, makes car noises. Does it all for the most part."

6572,Bluebonnet Nutrition Multi One With Iron,0/0,5.0,Was looking for something other than chewable vitamins that would disolve fairly quickly. Found the Bluebonnet brand and found them to be fine after having Gastric Sleeve surgery. My doctor had no issues with me taking them since they were not causing any issues. I like the value of the 180 capsule bottle because the 30s I was buying locally had a lot of wasted space within the bottles. I will definitely be buying again.
6573,Horny Goat Weed Complex 60 Caps,0/0,5.0,Good stuff right here it really does work and for the price it's a really good deal no doubt about it.
6574,Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray,0/0,5.0,This a great product. I have very fine hair. This product gives it great body but it is still soft not stiff. Worth the $.

6580,Channel Craft TTJ Jumbo Jacks in a Classic Toy Tin,0/0,5.0,Very well made set of jacks. It was fun to go back many years and play jacks again with a nice set of jacks. They have a good weight to them.
6581,"NaturVet Cranberry Relief, 50 Gram",0/0,5.0,Arrived before the scheduled due date! Our doggie started feeling better after second dose. Would purchase again from this company again.

6583,Andis Hair Clippers BGR Heavy Duty Rechargeable Clipper,0/0,5.0,"I've been shaving my head for 18 years now and this trimmer is amazing. Bar none the best I've ever used. It gets a bit warm after a while, but as long as you keep it moving its no issue. Simply awesome shave."

6585,Tigi S Factor Flat Iron Shine Spray Heat Defender,0/0,5.0,"Received very quickly and was packaged nicely and not damaged upon receipt. But even BETTER! THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING product that I have tried for a shiner/straightener/heat protectant. I live in Minnesota and the winters here are unbearable in regards to manageable hair and fly aways. I received this yesterday and I used this morning with my straightener. I sprayed a bit on while wet as one other reviewer recommended and then a few more squirts before I straightened my hair. I am caucasian and have normal long black hair, however color treated and it made my hair SO shiny and silky and and straight but yet bouncy and have a lot of movement. This is the best stuff on the market...and I have A LOT in my bathroom, all failed attempts and a lot of money wasted. I will forever buy this product and wish I could give it 100 stars! I listened to the reviewers and have in the past been skeptical of reviews because anybody (including the seller) can randomly rate an item. However you guys spoke, I listened and am a very, very happy girl!"
6586,Derma e Tea Tree & E Antiseptic Creme,0/0,5.0,This creme is exactly what I was looking for. I love that it has a combination of tea tree and vitamin E in the same product.
6587,EstroSense by Natural Factors 60 Capsules,0/0,5.0,It's been on these pills for a few days and I already feel like I've went from a 20 on the bitchiness scale all the way down to a 3 my over all mood is fantastic I feel totally refreshed. There is a bit of a weird smell when you open the bottle but it doesn't effect the taste of the pills Basically It smelled weird when I opened it but when I swallowed the capsules I didn't taste a thing my husband has noticed a difference in me also which makes things even better :) but don't take my word for it try it for yourself and find out!!!!!
6588,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/1,1.0,"This is a cheaply made, overpriced space hog. It's huge, which would be fine if baby actually liked it. My five month old hated being in it even though he loves hopping in general. The cheap plastic toy on one side pinched his finger. And to top it all off, it's treated with fire retardants!"
6589,Amazon.com,0/0,4.0,"Nice metal gun, but a very cheap plastic holster. I bought it for my grandson for Christmas, and it is still working."
6590,"Interplak Dental Water Jet, 1 each",0/0,2.0,"I had a Waterpick that lasted over 10 years until the hose crumbled one day. The pump, etc., is working fine. So, instead of buying the replacement hose, I decided to purchase this inexpensive model. It worked fine for a while, but after a few months the pump lost all of its power. It still runs, but I would be better off using a water fountain at a park. Besides that and the small reservoir, which I expected, and the crow bar you need to detach the reservoir from the unit when you need to refill, it is fine. I will never buy this brand again."
6591,Wahl Heat Therapy Complete Heated Massage at Home,0/0,5.0,"Nice settings, nothing fancy. Perfect condition. Is not ultra lightweight, but is manegable. I can massage my back with this no issues."
6592,Spa In A Basket Wicker Chest Bath Items Massage Tools,0/0,5.0,my wife loves taking baths reading her kindle we have a lounging tub and after a hard you will find her there the bath set was great as well as the basket it comes in wich will be a flower arangement
6593,Explorer English World Globe,0/0,4.0,A nice globe. It shows a lot of cities and major structures over the globe. The mountain ranges nd other geological features are raised. My son finds it very useful.
6594,HALO Newborn Micro-Fleece Sleepsack Swaddle,0/0,5.0,"My son who is...11 days old always hated to have his hands wrapped around. He was getting his hands out of any blanket, no matter how tight it was around him (while the blanket was still wrapped around. Today I used this sack for the first time...leaving his hands out, and it worked really great. One thing though, don't dress him up to warm since the sacks keep very warm by themselves. I have my son in a long-sleeve onesie and some socks and he seems quite comfy....."
6595,Melissa & Doug Pirate Chest,0/0,4.0,"The Good:The chest is great! The bandana (he loved), which was deemed a &#34;flag&#34; by my 6 year old, is hanging on his wall. The secret compartment, is very useful for hiding pirate coins.Not-So-GoodThe coins and eye patch included could be a bit better made. They seem very cheaply made.Other than that, good item for the price.I would buy this again!"
6596,"BaByliss Pro BAB2590 Porcelain Ceramic Straightening Iron with Removable Comb, 1.5 Inch",0/0,5.0,"Loved this product. I bought 2...gave one to each of my younger daughters. At first they were not thrilled, not sure why. The second time they tried it they changed their mind and they really liked it. I decided to try it myself. I already have a very expensive AMIKA flat iron so I wanted to see the difference. I can honestly say that I like this BaByliss BETTER!! I LOVE the comb attachment!!! What a great feature! I know my girls are NOT going to like me always using their flat iron, but I just can't help it :)"
6597,"Ritter Sport, Dark Chocolate with Whole Hazelnuts, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 10)",0/0,5.0,i love dark chocolate and this product is sensational. It's not a very sweet chocolate and the nuts give it a nice crunch.
6598,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,I like it..... it's better and cheaper than the store. And I also like it because I can re-use the box.
6599,"Bellagio Holiday Spice Cocoa, 1.25-Ounce Packets (Pack of 25)",0/0,4.0,"Soooo tasty, unlike all the other hot chocolates I've had which seem to rely on a lot of sugar for taste. I've had this brand's chocolate truffle and just as good. Took off a point because of the list of ""what-is-that"" ingredients."
6600,Fisher-Price Triple Hit Baseball,0/2,5.0,Bought this for my 4 year old grandson and as soon as I had the 4 &#34;D&#34; batteries in it we were outside playing ball. We have used it every day since Christmas! My 9 year old granddaughter loves to play as well.
6601,Spry Chewing Gum 100 ea,0/0,4.0,I liked the taste of the gum. I would buy it again. Its good to chew something that is healthy.
6602,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,I like the collar and i felt like it did what it was supposed to buuuut... My dog hated it! he did everything in his power to get it off and i could not get himto just leave it alone! I had a much better time training him on a reg collar or harness then I did with this. I would recommed this product!
6603,"Tuli'S Double-Ribbed PRO Heel Cups, Regular Size",0/0,4.0,I like the Tuli's double-ribbed PRO heel cups. I purchased a pair in regular but I really need a smaller size to fit more snugly since my heels are small. Do they make them in small? Otherwise they are okay.
6604,Fashion Pet Suede Shearling Coat,1/1,4.0,Nice product in terms of looks and warm and weight. I did not give it 5 stars because the straps are way too long for the coat size--I had to have them shortened by 2&#34; on each side.
6605,Merry Pet MPS002 Wood Room with a View Pet House,0/0,5.0,"Item came packed very well. Very well made. It was easy to put together. Just the right size for indoors. I wish the stairs were a little bit wider , but it is a great item for a great price. I would highly recommend this pet house for a small pet.."
6606,Emergen-C Cranberry PomegraN/Ate,0/1,4.0,"Just what I expected in a timely manor. Also hard to find this flavor in regular stores, and it tastes good."
6607,"24, Faubourg Eau de Toilette for Women by Hermes",0/0,2.0,"I was SUPER excited to get this in the mail, and then I actually tried it on. BLEH I smelled like my mother in law. Which is fine if you are over 50 but it made me feel really old. The upside is it has quite a strong staying power. I had to take a bath and scrub up with soap to get the smell off. I wanted it to be elegant and but it was just gross."
6608,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,"I had some leaks with these and they have a strong smell. I am getting the LUV's instead which smell a little less, hold up just as good if not better and are cheaper."
6609,"Exotic Environments Incan Vase Aquarium Ornament, Small",0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my 10 gallon tank, which houses 6 neons and 3 peppered corys. It took them a couple days to warm up to it, but now theres almost never a time where there isnt a fish or two swimming in and out of it. It's extremely aesthetically pleasing, and the perfect size for what i needed."
6610,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,4.0,I am always looking for a perfume with a fresh scent. I feel that I have found it with Auric Blends.
6611,"Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce",0/0,5.0,Love it. It's perfect for my very very sensitive skin! I definitively recommend. Doesn't dry my skin. I'll buy it again.
6612,"Neutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, 4.2 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"I have used far too many products on my face trying to control what blemishes do arise. I have started to trust Neutrogenas products more as of late due simply to reviews from others.First, this is far better for your face than the other scrubs that might use walnut shell and the like. The microbeads in this product will be far kinder to your face in the long run. Second, this does have a hydroxy compound in it; this is often recommended by dermatologists in place of using salycylic acid products.This product does not burn and I use it almost daily in the morning. I recommend it highly."
6613,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,0/0,3.0,"That doesn't mean they're good though, just good for the price. The standard ear tips are hard plastic and rough on the ears if listening to breath sounds for too long, or anything for too long at that rate. The additional ear tips provided in the package aren't any better. Honestly, I would just fork out the extra $30/$40 and just pick the Littman Classic. I just picked these up because I wasn't sure how my paramedic school was going to go, and I just needed a quick replacement for the time being. I'm definitely going back, and I'm definitely going to buy a Littman Classic before then because this just doesn't cut it."
6614,Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers School Bus,0/0,4.0,"The bus is great, the only complaint is the door. It comes off too easily. I am constantly putting it back on. Design mishap."
6615,"Larabar Fruit and Nut Food Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)",0/0,5.0,"Excellent product! This is the best price you'll find and free shipping with prime. These are very healthy bars that you should keep in your car, gym bag, desk, etc. to snack on when you're having the urge for something sweet. Good taste with no guilty feelings."
6616,AMARIGE For Women By GIVENCHY Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,2.0,I purchased this for my wife. Her is her take on the product
6617,OMBRE ROSE Perfume by Jean Charles Brosseau for Women - @ Up To 55% Off,0/0,5.0,"A friend mentioned this as a favorite of hers since the early 80's. I, too, had used it some years back.Not sure if it was still available (as I hadn't seen it in the Department stores I used to buy it in), I looked on Amazon and found it. I was pleasantly surprised and ordered it as a gift.Needless to say, my friend was very pleased to have her favorite fragrance again.The bottle and fragrance are elegant and beautiful. The choices range from Cologne and Toilet Water all the way to perfume. Bath products also available.Anything I've ever searched for, I have found on Amazon."
6618,Bachmann Trains Digital Commander Ready - To - Run DCc - Equipped Ho Train Set,1/1,5.0,"The train set was exactly what we needed. Being new to model trains, my son received a DCC sound equipped steam engine for Christmas as well as some Bachmann expansion track. The problem was his existing model train set was an Atlas and didn't have a DCC controller.The Bachmann track is incompatible with Atlas and he couldn't use all the functionality of the new engine. So, we decided to switch him from Atlas to Bachman and we found that this train set was the best way to get into Bachmann and a digital command controller. It was available at a great price and works great."
6619,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Natural Cotton,0/0,4.0,"I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn't re-purchase."
6620,"Hohner Kids / 16"" Rainmaker",1/1,4.0,I bough this for my 3 year old and 1 year old daughters. I play with it more than they do. It's cool but it's pricey in my opinion.
6621,LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166),0/0,5.0,This was a nice starter kit. The box was great for storage and holds additional Lego as you build your collection. Lego is a great product for kids and adults alike. Everyone should own some.
6622,Haba Play Food - Ice Cream Cone,0/0,2.0,"This is ridiculously small, I love Haba toys and am not at all thrilled with the tiny size of the ice cream, the pear or the apple...bummed about only one in the package, as well as the lolli pops. incredible waste of money and shipping. I know my son will like em anyway, so I will keep them but not happy!"
6623,"Tetra 77847 Whisper Air Pump, upto 20-Gallon",0/0,5.0,"I've had a number of air pumps in my time and this is as quiet as it gets - which is the main feaure that I look for. I hate having a beautiful relaxing tank and being annoyed by the buzz of an air pump. Yes, there is a small hum to this one - but it is very quiet in comparison to others and I can only hear the hum if I'm listening for it, close to it and nothing else is making noise in the room. It's also putting out plenty of air for a 35 gallon hex. I would recommend."
6624,Power NO2 - 90 Capsules Nitric Oxide Muscle Building And Muscle Enhancing Hemodilator,1/1,2.0,"Only used this for a short period, never saw any real affect its practically a placebo. Get a pre workout powder shake it will be better, don't get pills they don't work as fast as a solution."
6625,Playmobil 3075 Rabbit Hutch,0/0,1.0,I paid $78.00 for this item and it was very small . My grand daughter said she would prefer to use that much money for something larger.

6627,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Montauk The End,0/0,4.0,"I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn't re-purchase."

6631,"Mens Designer Cologne By Giorgio Armani, ( Black Code EAU De Toilette Spray 2.5oz)",0/0,5.0,"I have been wearing this since college, so i knew i like the scent. The item shipped a little slow, but i am pretty sure that is because it is a flammable material. The fragrance was real and came in the same packaging i received when i purchased it in a department store. The price was pretty good, but not a crazy deal. This bottle will last me about 18 months. If someone is looking for a new scent i would highly recommend this one. I would say i get a positive comment on it about 1/3 of the time."
6632,Liquid Stevia Root Beer 2 fl. oz.,0/0,1.0,"was not good with taste, had to use a lot to get the taste. if you want the rootbeer taste not worth the money"

6636,Bags on Board Bone Dispenser with 30 Refill Bags,0/0,1.0,"I dropped my leash, which happens and the thing cracked and was un-usable afterwards. Poorly made and designed.

6640,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,5.0,"Great train so far. I ordered for my son for Christmas because he loves the Polar Express. It is great so far. The only small complaint would be the rear platform falls off of the last passenger car a lot. You will need to glue it to keep it in place, especially if you run the train at faster speeds. That definitely should not keep you from purchasing this train. We look forward to expanding this set."
6641,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,Works amazingly! Our family's last ditch effort at combating dog hair in the house with a crawling infant. The tool works like a charm!

6646,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,4.0,"Overall, I love this soap. It does have a somewhat &#34;medicinal&#34; smell, but I might add some mint to soften it. If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren't familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents."

6659,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,This thing is amazing. I got it for a Christmas gift for my niece and she totally loved it. Since she was born she had been sleeping with her parents in their bed. She had never slept in her bed alone. The first night that she took this home my sister told me she turned it on and set it on her dresser and my niece crawled right in her bed and fell asleep with no problem. My sister told me she never even got up in the middle of the night to crawl in their bed. My sister loves it as much as my niece does. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little one who just might have a problem sleeping alone in the dark. If i had more little nieces and nephews they would all have one.
6660,"PowerBar Performance The Original Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars",0/0,5.0,"Every morning for breakfast #1 (I eat about every 2 hours), I have a Peanut Butter PowerBar. I Love it and I cannot help it!! Perfect Peanut flavor, perfect texture, I love this bar!!! Nothing to do with nutrition really, I don't work out, I just eat these because they taste good.

6663,Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer,0/0,5.0,"I like this tweezer compared to my other ones because it can pull out the almost impossible hairs that my old ones could not.The tip is slanted and when closed, the edges touch perfectly making its grip on hair better.there is a little plastic piece that covers the tip to protect it from damage.so far, this is my favorite tweezer :)"

6666,HoMedics TheraP Hot/Cold Therapy Back Wrap with the Power of Magnets,0/0,3.0,I ordered this product for my husband but it was too little so I sent it back and promptly got a refund. I wished it had come in a larger size because it really looked like a good product....there is a removable gel pack that can be either heated or cooled depending on what you need......I will be keeping an eye out for this product locally to see if I can get it in a larger size. The only drawback was the cost I incurred to mail the product back

6671,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"We bought this so our 6-month-old grandson could join us at the table when our kids and spouses join us each week for dinner. It's literally a snap to use. It fastens securely to our chairs using the back and seat straps. We even took it to a restaurant and strapped it to their chair for him! As it's all-plastic, cleanup is a breeze.He's happy in it, which makes mom and dad happy that they can eat with both hands again.Highly recommended."
6672,Sole Softec Response Custom Footbed,0/0,5.0,Christmas present for my husband. He loves these insoles and uses them in his shoes. They work well for his foot problems.
6673,Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith,0/0,1.0,"Stopped working after short period. It sounded good at first, but then became distorted and stopped working. Certainly not a battery issue."
6674,EarLift Invisible Ear Lobe Support Solution,0/0,3.0,These really do work if you can ever get your ear ring through them. It was too difficult and time consuming for me.
6675,Safari LTD Wild Toob,0/0,3.0,"The animals are cute, but they don't stand up very well at all. Very frustrating for a 3 year old when her animals keep falling over each time she just breathes on them."
6676,Tyrosine 500 mg capsules,2/2,2.0,"Starting taking just a few days ago. A few hours after taking one capsule I felt a knot in my stomach. I'd read reviews about possible upset stomach and had hoped it would bypass me. Nope. So I started to dig a little deeper into metabolism of l-tyrosine only to discover that it is not water soluble. I did a little test and opened a capsule in (warm) water. The powder actually floated on top the water and a film appeared over the surface of the water as well. I stirred the mixture up and it would not dissolve. So - back to research. L-tyrosine does not dissolve in the stomach and is excreted in urine - so how in the world is this stuff supposed to be absorbed in the body? I'm not sure if I am experiencing a placebo effect with these. I cannot stand the ache in my stomach. I take on empty stomach as instructed, eat a meal, feel fine for a few hours but then when hunger pangs start so does the awful ache. Granted the stomach is filled with hydrochloric acid, yet I envision a clump of white powder settled in the pit of my stomach. Hopefully I can get through the bottle. Does anyone have a remedy? Next I'll try n-acetyl-l-tyrosine - supposed to metabolize better. The only reason this is getting an extra star is simply for packaging and speed of delivery."
6677,Snowman or Santa Stocking Stuffer Christmas Holiday Gift Set,0/0,4.0,Wife liked the surprise she loves snowman. Filled her stocking up and she enjoyed lokking through everything on Christmas morning.

6682,FUJIYAM Cologne by Succes de Paris for Men - @ Up To 55% Off,0/0,5.0,This is a surprisingly fresh smelling cologne. Got my first bottle for my birthday from a friend and bought another bottle just because. You get a lot for the price and it doesn't smell like other colognes that are being sold at this price.
6683,OCUSOFT LID SCRUB FOAM Size,0/0,5.0,"I use this daily to sooth irritated eyelids related to high-count pollen days and dryness. It is very soothing, non-greasy, non-alcoholic. It works and feels good."

6685,Tropical Green Tea 20 Teabags,0/0,5.0,"I had this in a very upscale restaurant and asked the server to find out what brand it was. Couldn't believe it was on Amazon. Best green tea ever. You will know that just by the smell when you open the pouch. I don't even need sugar in it, another plus in my book!"
6686,Melissa & Doug Basset Hound - Plush,0/0,4.0,"I was very pleased when I pulled this stuffed dog out of the box. He looks great. But then I started feeling the construction and became less than pleased, particulary with the head. Inside the head is a blocky form of very light weight styrofoam... it even has that styrofoam 'squeek'. For the price paid, it needs to be better than that!!!I'm not sure how long this will stand up to my 3 yr old niece. But at this point she loves it.I would not recommend it for a toy but if you collect bassets, it would be great in a collection or for sitting on a bed."
6687,HORIZON Cologne by Guy Laroche for Men - @ Up To 55% Off,0/0,1.0,"It's dissapoiment, It's really bad fragance. It is a product that seems rebuilt and really smells very badIt is a product that seems rebuilt and really smells very bad"
6688,"Reese Large Pearl Tapioca, 7-Ounce, 6-Count Units",1/1,2.0,"This Reese large pearl tapioca is the same size as my small pearl tapioca. Silly me, I thought it would be like the stuff I grew up liking. I was so looking forward to whipping up some large pearl tapioca pudding. I am very disappointed."
6689,Midwest Life Stages Double-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate,0/0,5.0,I ordered this kennel to sit on top of an identical one I'd purchased at the store several years ago for a previous dog we had. This is by far the toughest kennel we've had and now our two boxers have ample space to sleep without needing to stay curled up all night. Love the two doors and the fact that it folds completely flat. Great price too!
6690,"""Wally"" the Flying Pig",0/0,3.0,"The product is pretty much what it says it is. The band seems a little stiff for a young child, but at the same time probably makes it more durable."
6691,Heritage Products Castor Oil,0/0,5.0,I took some essential oil and mixed it with the castor oil and we used this for a massage oil. I also use this on my skin to moisturize in general it's great stuff.
6692,Liquid Calcium Magnesium Citrate Plus Vitamin D by Bluebonnet 16 fl. Oz.,0/0,5.0,"I would recommend this product to anyone who needs supplemental calcium, magnesium and Vit D.

6694,"Buttermilk Powder, 1lb.",0/0,3.0,I thought this was going to be a bigger bag. I think I will check out how much they sell the name brand dry ranch mix at the big box store because I was underwhelmed.
6695,Master Grooming Tools Fine/Coarse Steel Greyhound Comb,0/0,5.0,High quality item. I would buy this type of comb and this brand again. Seems to be very durable and goes through the coat of my mini poodle puppy very well.
6696,Enzymatic Therapy Acidophilus Pearls,0/0,5.0,"Does what it does. I'm glad this product exists, as it's great for people who are lactose intolerant, but still wish to eat foods that are high in lactose."
6697,"LB Jamison's Regular Soup Base, Chicken Flavored, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"You might think you have to be a culinary professional to need 6 jars of soup base in your pantry, but you haven't tried Jamison's yet. My kids are carbovores and eat a diet of pasta and rice; I add a spoonful of Jamison's to the cooking liquid. I make soup from leftover meats and vegetables and always make my stock with this product. I have tried other brands when I couldn't find Jamison's, but none compare. When I could no longer find any merchant who carried this, I tried to get my local store to stock it, but had no luck. Once, when travelling, I saw Jamison's Soup Base on a grocery store shelf and grabbed several jars. Not wanting anyone to steal them from my luggage, I put them in my carry-on. Sadly, maddening-ly, airport security called the contents liquid (trust me, it's a powder) and wouldn't let me take it on board. I had to leave it behind. It makes me sad to remember that.I suppose you think that you will not use 6 jars of soup base, but you might, once you see how versatile it is. It will keep for, well, I don't know, but a long time, and the best part is that is will make several times over what a heavy, space-hogging can of chicken broth can produce. (you hate those heavy cans, don't you?)Happy cooking!"
6698,Melissa & Doug Orangutan in Plush,0/0,3.0,"We bought a lot of the melissa and doug large wild animal plush...this guy has an odd expression and overall appearance...and he sheds a good bit too, leading to my kids coughing up fuzz"
6699,Essie Nail Polish (.5 oz) Like Linen #231 (Sheer French Manicure),0/0,4.0,"I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn't re-purchase."

6705,Starter Cards,0/0,3.0,These pictures are colorful and big. I am disappointed about the parts on the pictures are not all in the wedgits I purchased so some are useless and can not be used. My son has not used them since he opened them.
6706,ST 37 ANTISEPTIC LIQUID Size,1/1,5.0,"Like everyone else, my dad SWORE by this stuff and even my grandmother once used it on a terrible burn on her son in the 1930s. She was poor as dirt but would spend the money on the blue bottle of ST37 because it worked on so many things.I had my grandkids for four days the first week of January. I dabbed some of this on my one year old grandson's ezcema because it was so irritated and he was scratching like crazy. He seemed like he really enjoyed with I would apply it and I only did so maybe 5-6 times. My daughter couldn't believe how much improved it was when she returned. She said other products have only reduced the irritation but the ST37 actually healed it up!Researched main ingredient and see that it's used in age spot treatment. Naturally, I have been dabbing on a tiny bit each am and pm and no kidding, it is lightening these age spots I've had for YEARS. I'm going to buy some for each of my kids and their families!"
6707,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,5.0,This could not have been a better purchase. Helps so much on my dog with his shedding and keeping his coat shiny
6708,"Ware Manufacturing Hay Ball, Assorted Colors",0/0,5.0,"I use this for my rabbit's Timothy hay mix and it works great. I just load it all into the ball and clip it to the side- very easy and simple design. My rabbit isn't litter trained AND he likes to tip food bowls so I've wasted a lot of hay in the past and it was getting frustrating. This lets him have as much as he'd like without me having to worry about how much of what I put in is going to wind up getting peed on! It's a great price and the little bell is a fun toy option if your rabbit likes toys (my old man really doesn't care for them, lol.) Great purchase!"
6709,"Larabar Fruit and Nut Food Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)",0/0,5.0,"When you get tired of the other bars, try this one; can't think of any other gluten-free bars with this flavor/taste. Not quite as &#34;heavy&#34; as some of the other Larabar flavors, but still a dense snack."
6710,Gillette M3 Power Cartridges 8 Count,0/0,5.0,"These are excellent blades for shaving with high quality steel and long-lasting structure. I would highly recommend this for anyone who's looking for a descent, but high quality replaceable shaving blades."
6711,"Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Daily Scrub, 4.2 Ounce",0/0,5.0,This face wash works wonders on my face! It has lots of tiny beads that exfoliate your skin. I have a mix of both oily and dry skin and this face wash works great for both parts. It also takes off makeup very nicely so I do not need any kind of makeup remover.
6712,BareMinerals Eye Shadow,1/1,1.0,"While I love, love, love this product, placing an order with this particular vendor was a mistake. It did arrive in a very timely fashion, however it came in the small, sample size packaging. I could have gone to the store myself and purchased the full size version for a couple of dollars more. This was a complete rip-off & I am very dissatisfied due to the fact that no where in the description was it mentioned that this was the small size. Won't be placing an order with them again!"

6715,Viaduct Bridge,0/0,4.0,love that the part of the bridge that goes over the tract and has the tunnel cut out for the train to go over is one solid piece. Some other brands have that part of the bridge as two pieces and the bridge is always collapsing. what i don't like is the round plastic pieces that connect it to the rest of the train tract. If you're going to make a wooden train track make it all wood please. A friend of ours has this bridge and she's already lost one of the plastic round pieces that connects it to the rest of the track.
6716,North States Superyard Play Yard,0/0,5.0,"Amazing product I've had this for about an hour and I'm in love!!!!! super easy set up comes already put together just open the box and pop it together, if you're a parent and unsure on if you should buy this play yard I would buy this all over again and I would be willing to spend way more just for my sanity!!!!

6717,Melissa & Doug Wooden Shape Sorting Clock,0/0,5.0,I really got this for my little cousin who I thought would like it. But instead his twin sister took it and played with it all Christmas night. So it is not gender specific. (Little girls are move advanced-proves the point).
6718,Dohm-SS Single Speed Sound Conditioner by Marpac (formerly known as the Sleepmate/Sound Screen 580A),0/0,5.0,The best noise machine ever. I have 3 in my home and would recommend this product to anyone. Easy to take on trips too!
6719,"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack",0/0,5.0,"I've used this product in it's prescription form as well--which is merely 120 mg as opposed to 60. I lost 120 pounds 10 years ago (not with Alli or Xenical--I did it with Weight Watchers, but I did it in my own, never went to a meeting), and I use this as a 'preventative measure', if you will. The more unpleasant side effects do subside with continued use, and they keep you honest."
6720,Amco Rub Away Bar,1/1,3.0,"I cook a lot and onions and garlic are staples in my daily meals. I thought this would be a nice little gadget to get the smell out of my hands as the science behind it works. No such luck. I'll keep using it though, then rub my hands on the sink to get the rest of the smell out, just like I've always done before."
6721,Atkins Advantage Bar Chocolate Peanut Butter,0/0,5.0,This product is amazingly tasty and filling. It taste fairly similar but not exactly to an oreo. If you have a sweet tooth like I do this definitely satisfies
6722,Excel Double Clip Extra Hands With Magnifier,0/0,1.0,"I seldom write reviews, this is probably my first review on Amazon in the last five years I've been frequently using Amazon.When I initially opened the box, I found a small ""Helping Magnifier"" box that was already in rough shape. Upon opening the box, all the components (including the magnifying glass) were loosely tossed into the bag. (see pic)First thing I did; inspect the magnifying glass. It is definitely usable, but chips or simply poor manufacturing are evident all along the edges.Next up was the ""circular"" metal band for the magnifying glass (see pic). I managed to wedge the magnifier in pretty good but there is a noticeable crookedness to it. Perhaps the difficultly in assembling this component was on my behalf but the damage to the parts themselves is inexcusable for something ""new"".Lastly, assembling the actual unit requires a ""Helping Hand"" itself. Although relatively straight forward, there are no directions (but like I said, it's clear what to do.)I am giving this product one star for now but if it performs well despite the initial complaints, I may be willing to give it two stars for how cheap it was.EDIT"
6723,Beetle Juice (1988),0/0,5.0,"Of course my opinion, but you can't beat Michael Keaton as BeetleJuice. Very funny, and full of Tim Burton's style."
6724,Yves Saint Laurent Opium Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,This has been her favorite cologne for years and she has never mentioned noticing the formula change I have read other reviewers have mentioned.
6725,"Pledge Multi Surface Wipes, 25-Count (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love these wipes. I have three small children and a big house to clean...I can use them on the wood, leather, glass, granite, bathrooms, and they don't streak and clean really well. I have tried soooo many products and this is by far my favorite! Saves a ton of time...and paper towels!"
6726,Pet Carrier Fasteners - 12 Pack,0/0,5.0,Exactly what we needed for our K9 unit to keep cost down by not having to purchase new crates. Excellent choice going with you guys
6727,Ombra Mild Camomile Deo Roll On Deodorant 1.7oz roll-on,0/0,5.0,"I found this deodorant in Canada. For those of us who wish to avoid antiperspirants, this is a wonderful deodorant without any of the chemicals that block the body's ability to sweat out toxins. It is sweet smelling and effective. This company ships quickly and the products always arrive well packaged and ready for us."
6728,OXO Good Grips Grout Brush,0/0,5.0,Brought it and was glad I did when I attacked the grout for the tile in my bathroom. Worked great...
6729,Nature's Way Blessed Thistle,0/0,3.0,"I'm taking this with Fenugreek and More Milk Plus and Goat's Rue, When I added this into my regimen, I couldn't tell any difference. I probably will finish this bottle but not buy any again."
6730,"Ware Fleece Hang-N-Tunnel Crinkle Small Pet Sleeper, Colors May Vary",0/0,4.0,My ferrett loved sleeping in this tunnel. However it doesnt hold up to my rabbit chewing on the ends. Overall its a great product. Even the plastic clips held up.
6731,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Bug Jug Fill & Spill Soft Baby Toy,0/0,5.0,This toy is great. Small enough to travel with. So simple...just 4 stuffed bug toys in a plastic container. My daughter loves to take the bugs out. Hasn't figured out how to put them back in yet. Love this toy.
6732,Manhattan Toy Skwish Classic,0/0,5.0,i had one of these when i was a kid and i bought it for mine he loves it hell sit there and just bend it and twist just use his imagination its a great buy with a good price made out of wood and well crafted
6733,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,SO much cheaper than getting one at the pet store. I cannot believe what the big pet stores charge for these cages. It folds beautifully down and the tray at the bottom can be removed for washing. GREAT value.
6734,Radio Flyer Town and Country Wagon,0/0,5.0,bought two of these wagons for our granchildren for christmas. these were easy to pull our grandkids in and they really enjoyed the ride.
6735,Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet,1/1,5.0,"This product was for a newborn grandchild..the mattress can be raised, thereby saving the adult's back..comes with a mini mobile, good for baby's eye focusing..playard is sturdy and easy to clean. would definitely recomment it..good value, too!"
6736,Melissa & Doug Geometric Stacker,0/0,5.0,Good product made of real wood. Should last a long time in our household.Colors are bright and base is well constructed.
6737,"Joseph's Sugar Free Maple Flavor Syrup, 12oz",0/0,5.0,the best taste and texture of any syrups out here. i wish they would use stevia as a sweetner now.
6738,"Pretzel Salt, 1 lb.",0/0,3.0,"Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product. Glad to do business with you.Will do it again"
6739,Evolution Self-Cleaning Slicker Brush for Dogs,0/0,3.0,"I bought something similar a while ago, but the tines have gotten bent over time and I fear the cats (yes, I got this for cats) are getting poked by misalligned tines.The old one can lock in the retracted (cleaning) position, minimizing such bending, especially as my cats will chew on it if left within their reach. The new one retracts only when the button is pushed.Aside from that, it's quite satisfactory, great for removing excess hair. But a pain to have to put out of cat reach when not in use."
6740,K&H Thermo-Kitty Sill Seat,1/1,5.0,"Kitty loves to sit in the window. I had a little trouble snapping it together, but it has held up well."
6741,Premium Madagascar Vanilla beans 1/4 lb by JR Mushrooms,0/0,5.0,"I bought these beans from JR once before for vanilla extract and it was wonderful... The beans were long, plump (for vanilla beans) and flagrant, quality all the way... I thought I would try another brand on &#34;ebay,&#34; I purchased beans from France, great price. Very disappointing beans, everything JR's were not, wouldn't even waste vodka on them. So in the mean time I have plenty of vodka while I am waiting on my new order."
6742,Marina Floating Thermometer with Suction Cup,0/0,5.0,So far so good with these thermometers. I use three now and all work well. Easy to read most of the time.
6743,Melissa and Doug Basic Skills Board,0/0,5.0,Melissa & Doug have created a great learning tool that helps children develop their motor skills. The bright colors and great design make it very attractive and fun.

6745,"BodyTech - Whey Tech Chocolate, 2 lb powder",0/0,5.0,taste just like chocolate milk. mixes easily. I would recommend this for price conscience shoppers. It is as good as the higher priced brands.
6746,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my baby when she was 5 months old. She could sit up with some help but not crawl, and this toy was perfect for her to sit at and play with. When she got better at moving around we could take the face off and set it on the floor, and she could crawl to it and hover over it to play. She is almost 9 months now and still loves this toy. She pulls up on it, pushes it across the floor & plays with all the components on the front. She loves it, so we love it. One of the best toys I've bought."
6747,Melissa & Doug 60-Piece Standard Unit Blocks,0/0,5.0,Exactly what it should be a simple set of unit blocks with a container. Great for building things even with a smaller child who is learning.The container seems like it might be harder to use based on the fact that the blocks are packed so tight. That said it has extra space due to some foam at the bottom that you can remove. It has turned out to be quite easy actually to get these back in the box.
6748,Melatonin 3 mg 60 Caps,0/0,5.0,My Husband and I are very happy with this product. so glad to have found it here on Amazon.com.We take one tiny pill when we are ready to settle down for the night and within 30 minutes we are sound asleep.
6749,"Klein's Naturals Peanuts, Roasted, Unsalted, 10-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I love unsalted peanuts but sometimes without the salt they can taste stale. These were nice and fresh and of good quality. They shipped them fast and they were in good condition. I recommend them.
6750,"Hagen Living World Drops Hamster Treat, 2.6-Ounce, Yogurt",0/0,5.0,Hamsters love treats and they will love this item. Item is as described. It's perfect to give them these treats for snack time.
6751,"Duro-Med Foot Stool with Support Handle, Silver/Black",1/1,5.0,i work with elderly frequently. It's the greatest thing since curbs. which i would hit every time i;d come close to them. my elders say this one step makes the world of difference
6752,Irene Gari Anti-Feather Lip Base,0/0,5.0,"FINALLY found a product that works and is inexpensive! I have been able to wear dark lipstick colors with absolutely no feathering, which is something I have not been able to do in a very long time. In addition, it lasts all day long. Because it works so great, I ordered 5 of them. Wish I had known about this a long time ago."
6753,"Learning Resources Rainbow Bean Bags, Set Of 6",0/0,5.0,Exactly what we needed for extra activities for busy preschoolers. I would definately buy them again. They were all working and have not had any problems with them.
6754,Toy Vault Mini Black Knight Plush,0/0,3.0,"I still love this anyway, because how can you not love the Black Knight?? But it's smaller than I was expecting, maybe the size of a Barbie doll, which makes reattaching the limbs a little challenging. It's not worth the price due to the size, but it IS the only Black Knight plush I've come across!"
6755,Bora Bora by Liz Claiborne for Men,0/0,5.0,"... i wanted a cologne that is fresh and unmistakably male. got just what i wanted with this scent. very light, &#34;up-in-the-air&#34; spritz recommended."
6756,Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance (select option/size),0/0,5.0,It's one of the better products that I've found at this point in my life. It's moisturizing without leaving a greasy residue behind. My skin has a natural look glow without the dryness. I'm very pleased and would purchase it again..
6757,Unker's Medicated Salve,0/0,5.0,"This product really works... Not only for all the things it says on the label, but when my chest is hurting or my glands in my neck hurt, I rub some Unker's on over night, and the next day I am much better. I do this for a few nights to take care of any problems. When my mom was a young girl, they rubbed some on her chest when she had pneumonia ... It worked."
6758,Sunbeam 756-500 Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,0/0,4.0,The size of this pad is convenient for use on a knee or shoulder yet it's still large enough for ones lumbar region. The low setting is warm enough for me. I suppose the other two settings are suitable for warming meals or beds.
6759,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,I normally don't like to curl my hair but this is a great curler for big bouncy curls. Great buy
6760,Uncle Milton Radio Control Tarantula,0/0,5.0,"Birthday gift for an 8 year old grandson. He loves it, uses it mostly to startle/scare his sisters. Thank you."
6761,"Americare Ultra Waterproof Sheet Protector, Colors May Vary, 34"" x 36""",0/0,4.0,"This product provided peace of mind when a very young grandchild came to visit. It was easy to use and by putting it under the sheet, the child was not offended."
6762,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,the best diapers ever!!!! i use them with my first baby and they are the most amazing never had any liking or rash on the kids body
6763,Rubik's Cube,0/0,5.0,"My son, now 42 y/o, used to work this Rubik's Cube within a minute. He instantly went into &#34;I can do this!&#34; mode, but is now so used to quick satisfaction with today's technology that he sat it aside after a few minutes. His wife then picked it up. Perhaps I should have given it to the granddaughters, but they too are spoiled to technology at ages 5 and 2. Hopefully they will try again."
6764,Opi Nail Polish - Mrs O'leary's Bbq #W44,0/0,4.0,"I love OPI nail polish because the colors are very opaque and the brush is thick which makes application easier. I love this nail polish, unfortunately it does not look a lot like the color shown in the picture. On my nails, it is a bit darker. Only when I put my hand right in front of your face can you see the burgundy tint, otherwise it just looks dark, almost black. In bright sunlight it does look closer to the color pictured, but not in artificial light or cloudy weather. I still give this color 4 stars because when you can see the color good it definitely looks like a dark bbq sauce, hence the name. Either way it is a nice color and OPI nail polish is better than most."
6765,Nite White Excel 3 ACP Z 22% Teeth Whitening 3pk Kit (Latest Product),0/1,5.0,Nite White Excel Z 22% Teeth Whitening 3pk Kit did the trick. They whitened years of coffee and tea stains and left my teeth a beautiful white.DO not wear for long periods of time or some sensitivity will occur.
6766,Zodiac Flea and Tick Collar for 5-Month Dog,1/1,2.0,"My senior pekingese's eyes suddenly got very weepy with alot of crusting from excess discharge.As she has never had this issue before,I thought it might be connected to the zodiac collar I had recently put on her.Sure enough,a day after removing this collar,all of her eye irritation ceased.In all fairness to the company,this was her first and only experience with a flea/tick collar,so she probably would have reacted that way no matter the brand.My only point is that sometimes a flea/tick collar just might be too harsh for some dogs to tolerate them!"
6767,"Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, White",0/0,3.0,I plugged it in and it wont come on at all. Not working and I really wanted this type of dryer
6768,Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,0/1,5.0,Best Xmas gift ever! Can't wait to use it over and over. Don't know why I didn't have one sooner!
6769,Sennheiser BA151 Rechargeable NiMH Battery,0/0,5.0,You never go wrong with Germany made products.The other brands won't keep the charge long enough and after few months won't charge at all.This battery is ORIGINAL and works great.
6770,"Pair of Thermoskin Wrist Brace, Hand Brace, Carpal Tunnel Brace with Dorsal Stay, Right and Left",0/0,3.0,They are okay but after an hour become very uncomfortable. I do not feel it helped my problem with carpal tunnel.
6771,Beaver dog toy,0/0,3.0,"I gave this to our Australian Shepherd, Emma for Christmas 2012. She loves it but quickly tore it apart, pulled out the squeaker holder and tore that apart, too. I have 3 more squeakers but will have to figure out another way for her to play with them. She still plays with both pieces though. I had hoped that with the Kong brand it would have held up better."
6772,Bissell 2102-B Sweep Up,0/0,5.0,was given as a house warming gift I was happy with the product of my own and as far as I know the gift was one that was wanted
6773,MopAway High Quality Twist Mop,0/0,5.0,"I have used a lot of mops, this is by far the best. The only fault I found with the mop is the twisting mechanism it's made of plastic. As you know over time plastic will loose the ability to stay the same way... BUT for $17 bucks if the mop will last one year it would have only cost me $1.42 a month to have a mop that works and clean. Not bad.. not bad at all."
6774,"Now Foods, Sweet Almond Oil",0/2,4.0,This was a product that I ordered to make some things with the grandgirls. We haven't used it yet but the smell is great and it was a great price.
6775,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,This product gives u the best feeling during usage after usage this definitely save u a trip to the dentist. This product really gets down in ur gums for extra cleaning. I use water and mouth wash mix to clean this comes with accessories also. After daily usage it's still going strong I keep my setting on 10. For first time using do not turn up high or it will hurt. Go slow. You will feel the difference after time u use it. This product makes ur mouth feel so good after u use it! I love it gets a high thumps up from me. I had this product over a year and it still works great!

6777,Buf-Puf Reusable Facial Sponge (Pack of 6),0/0,5.0,"I've been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge for 20yrs now, since I was 15 to be exact and I LOVE it! This product exfoliates my skin and always leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. My kids, 21 & 11 are now growing up using it and NEVER deal with any acne problems. I can't go without having this product, it is a staple in my home."
6778,Active Green Bar,0/0,5.0,"The protein bar has a good taste and excellent nutrition. The fiber helps mitigate the 18g of sugar, none of which is processed sugar. The 22g of protein provide a steady source of fuel for any activity. On this listing, there is a label showing a bar with 22g of sugar, which was the content in an earlier version of the protein bar. Check out the Active green bar, which has 30% more sugar."
6779,Barnett Bandito Toy Blowgun,0/0,3.0,It certainly shoots the darts a long way and without a great deal of effort. The only down side is that the sucker part of the dart does not stick to anything...even glass. But the kids love it.
6780,"Larabar Fruit and Nut Food Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)",2/3,1.0,Food Safety Recall
6781,Hartz Pom Poms Cat Toy,0/0,4.0,Not what I expected. They have a texture and noise that's hard to explain. My cat likes to carry things around in his mouth and this has become his favorite.
6782,"Pretzel Salt, 1 lb.",0/0,1.0,"This is not pretzel salt - it is closer to table salt. I was expecting large, white grains. This salt is nothing more than clear grains that are slightly larger than average table salt."
6783,Eros Original Bodyglide Silicone Lubricant,0/0,5.0,"When my friend was getting married, I spent hours researching the world's best condoms and lube etc. (Best condom"
6784,"Ricochet Mints with Xylitol, Lemon-Lime, 100-Count Mints (Pack of 6)",0/0,2.0,"When I purchase a ""lemon"" or ""lemon-lime"" mint or gum, I expect some level of sour, lemony-limey flavor! These have almost none! There is a faint lemon-lime flavor at first, and I mean FAINT but almost immediately they turn into a sugary-sweet powder on your tongue.There is absolutely ZERO relief from dry-mouth, they last for less than a minute and IF you pop several in your mouth hoping for better results, you'll have a clump of sweet sugar paste.Truly a disappointment! I really don't get the point of these little sweet powder drops!?The person who commented here on their strong flavor must be an employee of the Xyla company!!!!!!!!!!"
6785,Eden Eau de Parfum for Women by Cacharel,0/0,2.0,"I have used &#34;Eau de Eden&#34; by Cacharel for over 15 years. It smells like a fresh spring/summer day and made me feel happy! Because I can no longer find &#34;Eau de Eden&#34; I decided to try &#34;Eden&#34;. I thought, same manufacture, similar names could not be too different, right? I couldn't be more disappointed. &#34;Eden&#34; (I am very sorry for those how like it) for me smells like old lady, old things, makes me feel depressed and gives me a headache."
6786,Flower Le Parfum Perfume by Kenzo for women Personal Essential Oils,0/0,4.0,Bought as a gift for a good friend and she loves it tremendously. I would recommend this fragrance to all who are looking for something different.
6787,Zippo Lighter Fluid 12OZ.,0/0,4.0,So Pretty much the title says it all the cap need to be sealed better and spout easier to pull up besides that fuel is great.
6788,Elite 6-Inch Mini Thermostatic Heater,0/0,5.0,This was a perfect fit for our 10 gallon aquarium. We've had no problems. It did take a couple of days of monitoring to get it at the right place and I had to readjust when a cold front moved through. It works as it says and isn't too much trouble.
6789,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,0/0,5.0,Item just as described works great and arrived quickly. I Will order again when items needed. No problems very happy.
6790,Step2 Real Projects Workshop,0/0,5.0,This product was a big hit with my grandson. The parts gave us instant projects to build and can be taken apart to build again.
6791,Double Thick Nylon Deluxe Dog Collar in Hot Pink,0/0,5.0,It is the EXACT color I was looking for! And the 20 inch collar fits my 35lbs lab perfectly! Very happy :)
6792,Walk-About Spiral Tie-out Stake,0/0,5.0,A great addition for my dog. Make sure you purchase the the correct wire to go with the tie down.
6793,PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack),0/0,1.0,Wrong size battery.- does not fit in the battery recepticle. Very obvious mistake. Supplied batteries arthin and round and needed batteries are long and thick.
6794,"Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen, 3 Ounce",1/1,5.0,"I haven't really tested it against the sun because it hasn't been sunny since I got it but as a lotion it is great. It feels and smell good when applying it and it really has a dry touch even after 2 layers. My skin did not react violently against it. It did not form balls, on top of my light lotion and underneath both my light and full-coverage foundation. It didn't clog my pores either. Basically fantastic for me. I am now scouting for the next Neutrogena product!"
6795,Tommy Hilfiger Tommy Girl EDC Perfume Spray,0/0,5.0,"This is one of my favorite colognes, and I've been wearing it off and on for the last ten years. I tend to switch between this and David Beckham's flagship cologne. I like this one a lot more than the Beckham because the scent lasts pretty much all day.It's a fruity scent with hints of spice and cinnamon, and my wife says it smells great -- and her opinion is gold to me!So, try it out, it's really inexpensive, but still one of my go-to's. You won't be let down."
6796,Bright Starts Soothing Safari Mobile,0/0,5.0,One of the few toys that my baby is actually entertained by. i'd tried several other mobiles this is the first one that's actually caught his attention.
6797,Radio Flyer 32S All-Terrain Steel and Wood Wagon,0/0,5.0,"The wagon arrived on the day it was promised, and the assembly was straightforward. It seems very sturdy, and we really like the big, soft wheels. The fact that the handle folds under the wagon makes it easy to load in the car. The two little boys easily fit in the wagon, and the high sides keep them secure. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, solid wagon for their children."
6798,Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this product not expecting much at all and was even less impressed when it arrived. Ikea has better furniture than this.Just to make it clear, there is NO wood parts in this furniture, it is all pressed wood except for one support beam in the back. The wood feels flimsy and scratches very easy. There will be a dent if you put something heavy on top of it. I am a very handy person and it took me over 4 hours to put it together. The way the item is arranged is very disorganized and they need to learn from Ikea because I can put together Ikea Furniture in about an hour.IMHO, I would pass on this. I know the price is good and it looks decent in the picture but you can find something better. I am going to keep it only because I spent so long putting it together that I don&#8217;t want to waste another 5 hours taking it apart."
6799,Lambert Kay Linatone Plus Skin and Coat Revitalizer Daily Food Supplement,0/0,5.0,"This is exactly what happened...meow by meow. A few weeks ago, Mumzy found a stray dog. He was in a most horrible condition. He had been terribly neglected. When he was taken to the pet doctor, the pet doctor stated that the pup's skin and fur were in an atrocious state of condition. His skin was dry. His fur was dull, and not pleasant to the touch. The doctor recommended this product. Now, this new member of the household absolutely loves this product. Mumzy just mixes the appropriate amount with his food. It apparently tastes delicious, for one should see his coat now. It is almost as if,...this is not the same dog! His coat of fur is shiny and soft"
6800,Fisher-Price Winnie The Pooh,0/0,5.0,"I got this for a nephew, and he digs it with a golden shovel. He loves to bounce around with Tigger, so it is exactly what the doctor ordered!"
6801,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,2/2,4.0,Dogs like it. I wish it were a little thicker padding (but then I wish it were free and I was Queen). I think it is very good for the money.
6802,"MAALOX Advanced Maximum Strength Antacid Antigas 35 ct. Chewable Tablets, Assorted Fruit Flavor",1/1,5.0,"If you've sat through the past long dry spell since the Fall of 2011 when Novartis, the makers of Maalox products, among others, ""temporarily"" shut down production of many of their OTC products including this one, you may know how desperate I've been to find a replacement for the only product that worked for my GI upset. At first I bought the Maalox Advance tablets wherever I could find them, including here at Amazon & eBay, at ever increasing prices, rationing my consumption. I paid as much as 10x the original price to vendors who had clearly cornered the remaining supply. There is no other way to account for the price for this item. $88 for one bottle?! But about 6 weeks ago I refused to pay $85 for two small bottles on eBay. Novartis told me when i called them that production would be resumed ""soon"", but when?What to do? Once again I began a search for the two active ingredients in the tablets"
6803,"Galvanized Oval Wash Tub, 3.7 Gal",0/0,5.0,This washtub was just the right size to fit about 12 bottles of beer and soda. We used them for our picnic style wedding reception. They were well made and really cute!
6804,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,"We got two of these sets for our grandsons. Later the one came to our house and brought his along to demonstrate what he can do and make with it. After making something, he gave me a hug and said, &#34;Grandma, thank-you so much for this; I just love it!&#34; His mother was not there to prompt him to express his appreciation. Oh, I felt so gratified for having purchased this.The dads of both boys were really excited about this gift, as well.This is an educational toy and will keep them occupied and challenged for a long time."
6805,"Solaray - Ginger Trips, 60 wafers",0/0,5.0,"Great for at home or in traveling, both as an alternative to chewing gum or mints and as an aid to help with digestion."
6806,New England Patriots Premium Large Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,My dog weighs about 55 pounds and this collar is huge on her. I love it and she still wears it but it's definitely for large large dogs!

6816,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,"My cat seems to really enjoy this new fountain and it excels in all the important areas:* Holds a large quantity of water. For my 9-pound cat, I probably only need to refill it every two weeks.* Features a replaceable charcoal filter to keep the water clean.* Operation of the pump is quiet and the water doesn't continuously make a loud ""splashing"" sound. It is audible periodically depending on the wave patterns inside of the bowl but it's actually a pleasant sound.* Straightforward to disassemble and clean and comes with detailed instructions on how to do so. I've taken it apart once so far and it took about 10 minutes to give it a thorough cleaning. There is also a set of brushes you can purchase to make cleaning a bit easier although they aren't required.* Downloadable instruction manual on manufacturer's web site if - like me - you hate keeping piles on manuals in a closet somewhere.Overall this is a nice fountain and I'm hoping it's reliable and lasts for the long haul."

6818,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased this in September of 2012. I was extremely excited to get the unit as I had read all the reviews and I wanted to see how my 3 amigos would react. The unit was simple to set up and I had the unit running in no time. Oh, I highly recommend the Drinkwell Platinum fountain matDrinkwell Platinum Fountain Mat, MAT-D2for this unit. I did purchase the mat the day I purchased the unit and I can tell you it is a lifesaver. My kittehs took to playing in the water and some did spill out. The mat caught all the water and kept my laminate flooring from being damaged in any way at all. The mat also fits the unit perfectly and looks like it belongs with the unit. Ok, back to the 3 amigos. They simply love this fountain. At first they were typical kittehs. They walked around for a bit and would stare, and then act as if it were not there. Finally they would get close, and then jump back when one of my kids made a loud noise. Once they got over the newness they tried it. They have not looked back since. They all love it. I have one kitteh who thinks he is a raccoon and brings his food over to the fountain to be cleaned. Ok, ok, it is to play with the food in the water, but cleaning it sounds better. I have another little dude who uses his paws to draw the water from the waterfall to his mouth, and this is how he drinks. My other kitteh just likes to lap the water out of the bowl area. So I do have a little bit of experience with 3 different types of drinkers. Here is a rundown of things that may be of concern for those who are considering purchasing this fountain.Will the cats use it? I was concerned about 1 of my kittehs. He is kind of looney and I was worried this may be something he would have nothing to do with. My concerns were without merit as he was the first to try it out. All my kittehs love this fountain. Now, when I clean it, they follow me around and meow until I put it back on the floor for them to use. They have claimed their fountain and do not like me taking it away. They won't bother with a simple bowl anymore.How long do the filters last? I have 3 kittehs with the habits I listed above. My filter changes run around 4-6 weeks. I tried cleaning the filter, but it did not work. I watch amazon's prices and purchase filters when they are on sale at a decent price. You can either purchase them in packets of 3Drinkwell Fountain Premium Replacement Filter 3 packor in bulk where you get 4 packets of 3Drinkwell Platinum Premium Filters, 12-Pack. Prices vary so you have to watch. One day it is cheaper to purchase just one pack of 3 and on others it is cheaper to purchase 4 packs of 3. Keep your eyes open. As far as the filters go, if you don't change them then the water simply runs over the top of the filter and into the basin. You can still use the unit; it just won't filter the water.What are the filters made of? The filters are a formed trapezoid of fibrous material which is likely what is used for fish tank filtration. The filters will only take out foreign material such as hair or dirt so it will not circulate into the water fountain continuously. The filters will not take out any heavy metals or minerals. It is a basic sediment filter only with a light carbon backing and some carbon granules between both the front and back to remove odor. How much odor is removed, I cannot attest to, as I have a filter on my sink and do not use straight tap water for the fountain. However, from my experience in fish tank filtration I would say it is adequate.Ease of use? I have had absolutely no problems with the unit. It is very easy to put together. Once you understand how to change the reservoir it is a snap. Just remember that the reservoir cap has the plunger on it so you do not spill any water when you put the full reservoir back on the unit. You must hold the plunger out as you are tipping the reservoir over so it does not spill. Once you have it over and you are lowering the reservoir onto the fountain the plunger will be pushed up as it is lowered and then the water will be able to flow from the reservoir into the fountain basin.Cleaning? I have not had any of the problems cleaning that others have mentioned. I went to Wal-mart and purchased a dish cleaning brush that was to be dedicated to cleaning this unit. I have not had any problems reaching every area except one. The one area I need a long small cylindrical brush for is the tube from the pump to the top of the filtration basin. However, you can clean that area with a paper towel and a thin Phillips screwdriver if you had to. So cleaning really was a breeze. I would recommend that you are careful when cleaning the reservoir. Do not drop it or it may crack. By drop, I mean do not drop it from a standing position onto a hard floor. Dropping it in the sink won't crack it. The plastic is thick and seems to very durable.Water Noise? Noise has never been an issue. We keep the unit in our kitchen, which is near our living room. We have never had any annoying noise from the unit that disturbs us in any way. If you are a person who has to have utter silence at all times, then you would not like this anymore than another item that has running water. You can turn the unit up to the highest setting and you may think the unit sounds like a small running brook. If that is annoying to you then do not purchase this unit as it is a fountain with running water. Not sure what you would expect from such a unit?Motor Noise? I have never heard the motor at all, except on one occasion. The reviews mentioning the motor noise are either running the unit dry or have a bad motor. You should not hear a motor like this running. If you do then you have something wrong. Also, check your plastic pre-filter. I did hear an odd noise from my motor one time 6 days after I had put the unit down. The problem was that my longhaired kitteh, who loves to put his paws in the water, had clogged the pre-filter with his hair. It was causing the motor to have to strain, thus the noise. I simply cleaned the pre-filter and all was well.Leaking? This unit is molded as a single reservoir that sits upon a molded basin. Unless you have a crack in your unit, it should not leak. The first time I Put the reservoir down I was not careful and I allowed water to run into the unit before I put the reservoir all the way down. As I already had the basin full, this caused the basin to overflow and to stay high until the reservoir emptied. My mistake and I never made it again. Thus, I never had water over the sides again, unless my kittehs are playing in the water, which is kind of the point of having this. That brings up another point. How many of the people complaining about leaking have simply not realized their kittehs are now playing in the water which in turn has the water coming over the sides looking as if the basin is leaking? The whole point in purchasing this type of fountain is to encourage your kittehs to drink more water. I also purchased this unit as a way to allow the kittehs to play in the water more. Many cats in the wild prefer to drink from running water. There are different theories as to why, but the fact remains that they do. It is part of our kittehs past to seek out running water. Only when we domesticated them did they have to settle for sedentary water dishes. By giving our little friends these fountains we give them one more natural way for them to act. Once they get used to it, they will enjoy it more and more, and likely make more of a mess. If your unit does leak, and you know for sure your kittehs are not enjoying the fountain in a playful way, you likely have a crack.I highly recommend this pet fountain to anybody who has small to medium sized pets. I purchased a second unit from Amazon.com's Warehouse Deals when I saw the price of a used-like new unit drop to 33.00.Enjoy! And as my 3 amigos say, ""Meow, meooooooow meow, and mrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreow!"""

I will be able to find something at the hardware store to fix it, but this is not as sturdy as it was advertised.

I've had them about 2 years, and they have still maintained their form, and I don't have any pain anymore as long as I wear them. I wouldn't mind having inserts that feel a bit better on my feet in terms of the material. It's not bad, but it doesn't have ANY cushion. So I'd probably recommend considering the same inserts with the cushion. But, these have worked well in terms of providing better arch support."

6843,Philosophy Microdelivery Purifying Peel,0/0,2.0,"I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars at the dermatologist to try to repair the damage from my youth and to hold off aging. The good reviews for this product far outweighed the bad so I thought I would try it. I have used it 4 times now with no bad side effects like some have mentioned with break outs and such. It does feel a bit warm going on which me me hope something good was happening. At the dermatologist office, your skin can get so hot you need a fan while they are working on you. With this product, you get no actual skin peeling afterwards as the stronger products do. Maybe this stuff is good enough to use in between office visits but it does not replace what the professionals do if you want to see serious changes. I would never buy this again due to the price alone."

I am in central Connecticut, and the skies are not the darkest here, but even so, my first evening of viewing was very rewarding - with clear skies and no moon, once I got Jupiter into view, it was wonderful. What was otherwise just a bright object in the sky was now clearly visible with multiple stripes and four or more moons lined up. I have not yet connected the electronics - looking forward to that! Assembly was easy - maybe 45 minutes or so. It was a little tricky aligning the finder scope with the primary optics - I wish that had been a bit easier and I'm still not thrilled with the correlation, but I'm still learning. The clarity of the image and ease of use are outstanding."

6867,Neckpro Cervical Traction Device - Adjustable Door Bracket Model - Cervical Traction,0/0,1.0,"I not only suffer from neck pain for the past few years. I was recommended traction by my doctor and spent several months at PT. The therapist did traction using her hands while also assigning me exercises to build the muscles in my neck. Overall, the muscles become better but I continued to suffer from vertigo and have pain. I started to investigate these gadgets for doing traction on my own. Of course the ultimate are the $300 electrical machines. Considering what I paid for in PT, maybe that would have been a better investment. This model had good reviews so I took a chance. I read that some users with TMJ had difficulty. Some users also tweaked the unit to reduce jaw pain. Following this advice I purchased a few parts at a hardware store. This reduced the pressure on the side of the jaw. That said, the unit is holding on to to the back of your head and under your jaw as it lifts up your head. I'm sorry to say that even with my tweaking of the machine, I was having pain in my jaw. It does help the neck. Can't say it is a night and day difference. I proceeded to use the units several nights and worked my way up in weights. After 1 week my TMJ was flaring up. Bottom line"

6869,Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"Performance-wise, this is probably trimmer on the market. The stock blade is sharper than any other blade I've used as is. However, this is NOT a beginner tool by any means. This blade took me several attempts on several different occasions to properly zero-gap, meaning to get it to a point where it won't break the skin and won't compromise performance. Even so, after all that frustration, it requires a very very light touch. I probably would not recommend dragging this blade along your skin, right-side up & zero-gapped, as you will probably injure your client. I'm sure this will get a little better after the breaking in period. If you are a novice, I would recommend another trimmer, probably an Andis Outliner II since the blade is a lot more manageable while zero-gapped, while still giving you a sharp line. If you have several years of experience and a light touch, I think you should try this trimmer as this blade is a HITTER out the box. However, prepare to tinker with it repeatedly."

More so, if you have a long haired dog because of the necessary snug fit, so that they will stay on. However, I found it very much worth the effort.

Coupled with his Hurtta Overalls, the only body parts that required drying off were his tail and head and it was raining pretty hard."

6872,Manhattan toy Baby Stella Doll,0/0,4.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 month old daughter. I thought it would be the perfect 'first doll' for her. The look on my daughter's face was priceless when she saw Stella. Her face lit up and she had the broadest smile ever. She hugged her and could not stop giving her 'kisses'. It was so worth it. Stella stays in her crib until she falls asleep. She used to cry herself to sleep but now she just babbles herself to sleep with Stella listening. The dolls face is very intriguing to my daughter. Something about the face puts a smile on my daughter's face each time she sees her.My daughter, if she could, would give this product a 5 but as a parent I gave it 4 because of several factors. The velcro on the doll's dress opens easily by a 9 month old. Also, whenever I get the doll out the crib after my daughter falls asleep, strands of her hair come undone from the ribbon. When Stella begins to look unkept, I loosen the string holding the hair, tighten and neaten her hair and then feed it through the ribbon which does not loosen. the ribbon is fixed in a loop and bow so a child can't undo it and potentially choke on it.All in all, it's a very cute and soft doll. I can teach my daughter about body and face parts. She's become very protective of the doll especially when her twin brother tries to fling her around the room."

6880,Optimum Nutrition ZMA,1/1,5.0,"I never write or recommend supplements to others but after trying this I had to say it works pretty much as I expected it to work. Immediately after taking this, I found my sleep to be deeper and as many described a little more vivid in the dream department. The weird dreams only lasted a few days.I cannot say whether this boosts testosterone but I can say that I am not tired and worn down like I had been for several months prior to finding this. I have been a gym rat for almost 20 years and usually workout at 5:00 a.m. Being in my mid forties, I have slowed down a bit and with a regularly moderate to heavy workout I was feeling completely exhausted. My 'T' was checked on my last physical and was within the normal range and so I won't attest to a miracle with this and claim my 'T' got higher. Maybe on my next physical I will get a comparison and post the variance (if any) back here.In my opinion the greatest thing that this product does is let you rest which overall increases your workout. I give this a 5 because from day one I saw a difference that I am still receiving over 4 months later. I am definitely not tired as I once was."
6881,NO Shotgun MHF-1,0/0,2.0,"Tried it doesn't work for me. I get the tingle in the skin, but no extra energy. Cant seem to get a good pump either. Mixes grainy. The grape bubblegum flavor isn't bad."

6884,Savogran 10622 Trisodium Phosphate (TSP),2/2,5.0,"Just wondering what the difference between these two are:STPP - Sodium TripolyphosphateTSP - Trisodium Phosphatelooking for the best product to add to dishwashers and washing machines.I have read that STPP is ""food grade"" meaning that it is used as an additive to foods.I am NOT an expert, but I found a post that says this:------------------------------------------------------------TSP (TriSodiumPhosphate) is NOT the correct additive. It forms a precipitate ... basically dust in the water.The correct additive is STPP (Sodium TriPolyPhosphate), which does not form a precipitate.TSP could prematurely wear parts in your dishwasher.It's easy to get confused ... STPP ... TSP.TSP is used in third world countries because of cost not superior results vs STTP.[...]-----------------------------------------------------------I do not know if this is TRUE or FALSE, asking for help from others here that might know!Thanks."

6887,"Moen DN7005 Home Care Multi Grip Tub Safety Bar, Glacier",1/1,4.0,"Purchased this safety bar for my mother, who has mobility issues due to hip surgery. Bar is lightweight, but very sturdy. Installation was fairly easy with the included tool, but the instructions could have been a lot better. Plastic caps that cover adjustment screws break off easily, but this does not interfere with the bar's performance. Neither of these issues is a deal breaker, but that's why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. Still, I would definitely recommend this bar."
6888,Halloween Perfume by J. Del Pozo for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,"I have a hard time buying perfume that I like on my wife. We were at a Mexican grocery store and smelled a nice scent on one of the other shoppers. We didn't speak Spanish, and she didn't speak English. Somehow we figured out the name and look of the bottle. After some Internet searching, we found it. Her reaction to the name wasn't great.When it arrived, the packaging and bottle are very nice. After applying the scent, it took about 5 minutes for the scent to really develop. This was a great purchase, and I am sure we'll buy more."

6893,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"Marshmallow is a really common name drop around nail polish blogs, especially when it comes to combining it with glitter and making glitter sandwiches and the like. That's why I purchased it, and it didn't disappoint. Application is smooth, color is... delicious and marshmallow looking..? Keep in mind it is a jelly and takes several coats to become opaque, but I knew and expected and desired this going in. And Essie, as a more fancy brand than your average drug store polish, still holds a not-too-steep price point."

I wish I could have returned it but it was already half put together by the time we realized it was crap and we couldn't take it back apart without completely ripping it up..."

6915,Digital Video Recorder,0/0,2.0,"picture quality is terrible. Grainy doesn't start to describe it. You need batteries and an SD card, which is not included. My daughter had fun with it today, but I have a similar style flip camera that costs about the same right now, and the quality is FAR superior (internal memory, rechargable battery, pretty solid picture) to this. Seems like more of a $9.99 item, which it probably will be on clearance soon."

I will use this all the time and the big size lasts for months which will help me save money in the end because i wont go buy five packs of makeup wipes. Overall I love this product, although a slight amount of it did leak, it was not too much and it was in a bag to begin with so it didnt get all over anything else that i purchased at the time! Would highly recommend it!"

A third of the little ""beads"" are missing from the ends and many of the plastic bristles are bent at 90 degree angles. I'm having to throw it away because it pulls my daughters hair out when we try to use. I loved it initially, but gave it a 3 because 18 months later I am again searching for a vent brush with good reviews. I may end up buying this one again knowing it has a 1 year lifespan."

We were excited, until we tried to blow it up. It had not one but *two* leaks, and one of the leaks someone had clearly tried to fix already. This was packaged as new, but the globe is useless. I still think it is a good idea and want my kid to be able to play with it, but we're going to look elsewhere to buy it."

6928,Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Handyman's Toolbox of Treats Gift Bag Tote,1/1,2.0,The basket had a great appearance online and looked to be &#34;larger&#34; than it was especially for the price. The contents were very small and individually priced. I bought this for my brother the portions were appropriate for a child. The same held true for the second basket of equal value I sent to my mother- in law. The only saving grace was the discount I received with applying for amazon credit card and receiving 50% discount.

I don't think there are safer products available for your pets. Oddly enough, there aren't many low fat products available for dogs. I have an over-indulgent Doxie. I cut back on treats as much as I can, but when I do give one, I like it to be as low fat as possible. I've been buying their products for at least three years."

I've had it about a year now and I'm a little disappointed because one of the cardboard pieces on the inside has bent, so now the scratcher doesn't sit level inside the box anymore. I've tried to straighten it back, but it keeps bending. I gave it 3 stars for the durability."
6935,"The Gluten-Free Pantry All-Purpose Flour, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I've tried mixing my own gluten free flour concoctions, which is expensive and a bit cumbersome. Also, this last summer, when it is was so hot, ingredients straight from the bin at the Coop went rancid. The store owners explained that to avoid the possibility of bacteria in those bins, it is safer to use packaged material. When I tried this flour, it did the trick as well or better than anything I made on my own, and the cost, actually, is about the same. Just easier on me. I don't have to add any other ingredients to make it work as &#34;regular&#34; flour in our recipes for pie dough, shortcake, etc. Haven't tried making bread with it, because I just buy frozen gluten free bread."
6936,"Zoo Med AquaSun T5-HO Double Light Linear Fluorescent Hood, 30-Inch",0/0,5.0,"This light works very well on my 29 gallon aquarium and the t-5 bulbs on a timer deliver enough light for aquarium plants to grow. I do wish however that this fixture used 24&#34;L. bulbs instead of 22&#34;L. bulbs, since it seems there is extra space in the fixture which would accommodate longer bulbs and perhaps more even distribution of light to the sides of the aquarium."
6937,Sentry HC Groom'n Comb/with Catnip Pouch,0/1,2.0,"I like these in general, have had one before. But the brand I got (Groom n' Comb, not the one pictured here) the comb part comes loose when the cat rubs against it. It should be all-in-one."

6951,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,4.0,"We gave the Drinkwell Platinum fountain to the cats for Christmas. We sprinkled catnip all over the box before wrapping it, thinking that would tip them off to the box of awesome awaiting inside. No dice. They walked up to it and rubbed against it, but wouldn't unwrap it. So we tore the paper open a little bit and dropped some tuna in there. They went for the tuna, but couldn't figure out how to peel the wrapping paper back to get the rest of the tuna out. So much for that experiment. We just decided to unwrap it for them so we could set it up.The fountain was easy to fill and set up. A few other reviewers have complained about charcoal dust from the filter getting loose and settling in the bottom of the fountain, even though they followed the directions and rinsed the filter. So far, we haven't noticed any such problem, but I think it depends highly upon how you rinse the filter. If you just hold it under running star, very little water will go through--most of the water just goes around the filter. Instead, hold the filter right up against the nozzle on your faucet, so the water has nowhere to go but through the filter.One of the cats seemed scared at first. He kept walking up to it, but seemed kind of freaked out and walked away. Maybe he just didn't understand what witchcraft could put a small stream and pond in the living room where there was previously no abundant source of fresh water. Within a few hours we saw him licking water from the top of the stream, but he didn't drink much. I think he likes it to the extent that it's his water bowl, but he doesn't seem to care whether he's drinking from a luxury $50 pet water fountain or a $5 ceramic bowl.The other cat was immediately intrigued by the fountain. He stared at it for a little while, then started drinking from it. He drank...and drank...and drank...and drank...for about 2-1/2 minutes. Then he left for a minute and came right back to drink some more. I'm not sure if he drank so much because he doesn't usually get to drink water in the living room, or because of the fountain, but either way, he likes the fountain. He seems to prefer drinking from the pool rather than the stream.One thing we had kind of hoped was that the fountain would be enough of a novelty that the cats would want to drink from that instead of any other water source they find around the house. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have any effect on that. Now that the fountain is in the ""cat room,"" it just can't compete with the convenience of having water in the living room (in my drinking glass) or the novelty of a big porcelain bowl of water in the bathroom.Overall, I guess the Drinkwell fountain is nice because it holds quite a bit of water and you don't have to change it out every day. But with the added cost to operate (electricity + filters), it really is just a luxury that your pets may or may not care about. If you want to get your pets a water fountain, this one seems to be a pretty decent one. I guess we'll see how long it lasts. If it runs for several years without any problems, I'll be happy, but if it dies in less than 3 years as some people have reported, I'll probably bump it down to 1 star.It would be nice if they added a timer so it would run for a few hours, then turn off for a few hours--I'll probably get a separate timer at some point and plug the fountain into that. I also wish they had a porcelain version instead of plastic, but I'm sure they would charge at least 3x as much for that model."

6953,Hitachi Magic Wand Massager,1/1,5.0,My wife will never go on holiday without packing 'Michael' first. She is on her 4th or 5th one now. Took some getting used to but now she reaches the strongest orgasms ever. Use a lot of oil down below and you will not be disappointed.
6954,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Jungle Friends (Safari) Jumbo Knob,0/0,5.0,"I used these Melissa and Doug puzzles for early intervention speech therapy sessions and they are the right size and amount of puzzle pieces for the under three crowd. They may not be as exciting for very long to older kids but definitely for 1-3 year olds it is a great toy that helps with cognitive and language skills, of course always within the context of adult-child interaction."
6955,Hot Tools Ion Ceramic Steam Flat Iron,0/0,2.0,It didn't work well. Not enough heat or steam. Hair got stuck in it. I sent it back. They were excellent on the return and my credit. Thank you!
6956,Red Folding Soft Sided Carrier Crate for Pets up to 25 lbs.,0/0,5.0,Light weight but sturdy. Was surprised to see pet adjust to it immediately. Was able to accommadate a 16lb cat easily.
6957,Claudia Stevens Cover That Gray Temporary Touch-Up Color Stick,0/0,4.0,"I got this rather quickly after I ordered it and I must say for the price, it's a fabulous product. It is not too greasy and gave me good coverage until I need to color again. I did not notice any rub-off on my clothes either so I much appreciate that. I have black hair so the black blended in quite nicely - no one could tell that I used the stick. It's also small like a lipstick so I can take it in my purse whenever I need it. For the price and the gray coverage it provides, you can't go wrong."
6958,Omega 172 Chrome Shaving Brush Stand,0/0,5.0,This little guy stands about 2.5 inches tall and is the perfect size for my Art of Shaving brush. Very stable and sturdy.
6959,Duro-Med 4 Ply 28 x 36 Quilted Reuseable Bedpad,0/0,5.0,Very well made and most importantly; very absorbant. Going to order two more now!! Great product for the price. Thanks!

6962,"Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I tried this tea on a whim after reading reviews and using a gift card so I felt I had nothing to lose. I am so glad I did. This is now the only tea I drink. I even had to buy a tea kettle and tea pot to complete my tea experience. This tea is nice and strong, meant to stand up to milk and sugar. It is never bitter. A large mug of this and a good show on the tv= heaven!"
6963,"NorthShore Premium Green Super-Absorbent Underpads, Ultra Large Size 36 x 36, Pk/10",0/0,1.0,"It is too easy to rip apart when try to hold the pad to move patient on the bed, not what I expect."
6964,"Old Mother Hubbard Crunchy Snacks for Dogs, 20-Pound Box",0/0,5.0,"I was initially going to but a bulk box of the large dog treats, but decided against it considering that other reviewers complained about a large quantity of the big treats arriving broken. So, even though I have a 100 lb dog, I got a box of the smaller treats (which survived the shipping process).I ran through a 'taste test' with the dog and he seems to approve of all the assorted p-nutty flavors."
6965,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,4.0,"I was interested in trying out the various scented versions of Bronner's well-known &#34;Pure Castile Soap,&#34; so I ordered the hemp almond. It smells a little more &#34;Bath & Bodyworks&#34; than I had anticipated; it's got a decidedly girl-ish (as in the type of young teen who buys that fake vanilla scent at the mall - bleh) scent to it straight out of the bottle, but it mellows out and the scent doesn't linger. Despite that, I won't be using it as a body wash -- this bottle will be delegated to dish duty and the like.I think I will try the Lavender scent next -- I hear that it smells more like the actual Lavender plant, as opposed to the chemically-formed, mall-bought version."
6966,Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,0/0,4.0,Purchased 2 and a half years ago and have lent this out to friends. Works great and our little one loved it. I would recommend

6969,Crystal Stick For Men 1 Unit Crystal Body Deodorant,0/0,5.0,"This is one of the best deoderates i've used. It will 100% keep you dry.The only downside is, it's got no smell what so ever. Not that, that's a bad thing.No smell is better then a bad smell. But a little Irish spring would be nice.All in All is a great product, No harmful chemicles.Win Win if you ask me.P.S. They make a liquid product too which I now own...Easier to apply. But both are Great !!"
6970,Ginger Drink -Gold Kili 40 Sachets Packed in 2 Bags,0/0,5.0,I am a tea drinker and this is a wonderful addition to my cup of tea. I let other friends try it and they all wanted more.
6971,Home Health Facial Herbal Cleansing Gel,0/0,5.0,"This removes every speck of makeup. I tried to do the olive oil routine after first trying this product and the olive oil really doesn't work this well- despite all of the great reviews online. I am kicking myself for not just sticking with this because changing caused a breakout. I have hormonal acne plus sensitive skin, and this doesn't get rid of every last spot, but certainly keeps it under control. A little goes a long way, it is affordable, and seems to be pretty natural."
6972,Skwish Color Burst (Boxed),0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my second son because my oldest loved his friend's skwish so much when he was an infant. This is perfect for the 2+ month stage when they are learning to grab things. It is crazy light and has lots of spots where tiny hands can grab and hold, and the toy makes a pleasant hollow rattling sound when shaken. It is great."
6973,Carex Carex Sitz Bath,0/0,5.0,"Sturdy. Works for me perfectly. Compared to other brands, this one seemed to have better quality. I use it everyday now."
6974,Dickinsons Dickinsons Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner,1/1,3.0,"The smell was wired, more like alcohol, not very pleasant anyway. And after using it, my skin became very dry and I don't know why."

6977,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",2/2,5.0,"My dogs fur is so thick that the shock collar was less then ideal. My dog use to bark continuously all night. We tried the bark collar but were unhappy with the results. I am so glad I gave this a try, works like a charm. All it takes is one bark from her when it is on and she gets the idea. It is so nice having bark free nights.Cons"
6978,North States Superyard Play Yard,0/0,4.0,Great product for the price! The North States Superyard is sturdy enough that the infant/toddler can pull up on. Shape can be changed to a rectangle as well.

6982,Nature's Way Selenium,0/0,4.0,I got what I expected - what can really be the surprise with pills. Yes the pills were in the bottle.
6983,Flowbee Hair Cutter,0/0,4.0,The Hair Cutter works fine. It is easy to use for my butch haircut. The only thing is the attachment to the vacume cleaner. The vacume creates too much vacume and pulls on some of the skin areas making that spot shorter than areas around the affected spot. I now know not to turn on the vacume cleaner until I am through using the unit because the Flowbee has it's own vacumebuilt in to the unit.

6987,"Aquaclear Foam Inserts, 3-Pack",0/0,4.0,"I have the aquaclear 70 and I bought this 3-pack extra foams since I don't use carbon, I want my filter to have 2 foams + ceramic media.The original media included with AC 70, is denser, this 3-pack has bigger pores compared to the original media. The physical size of the foam is the same.I still recommend this item specially if you want to double the foam if your not using carbon in your filter."
6988,"Marshalls Creek Spices Soul Seasoning, 18 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I was so happy to find this.. You used to be able to buy this in the store but no longer sell it. I was so happy to find it ,"
6989,Do A Dot Art Marker Rainbow 6-pack,0/0,3.0,I bought this for my niece because she loves arts and crafts products and my mom thought she would love them. My mom used to teach at our church's daycare and said her kids (age 2) loved using them and making pictures with them. My niece is 4 and she did not quit like the dot concept. she kept wanting to write with them as regular markers. in terms of the product itself it arrived as described. it does take awhile at first to get the ink flowing but after that it comes out fine. they do not work so well as regular markers so i think this product depends on the kid.
6990,Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads,0/0,4.0,The shaver itself has the advantage over rechargeable of a lighter mass. The replacement heads worked fine but worked noticeably better at first than after a few shaves.
6991,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"I was looking for some fun and different toys for my dog for Christmas and I came across this brand. I instantly thought this was adorable and after reading the reviews had to have it. I have an 85lb goldendoodle and he just loves this toy. He doesn't play with it as actively as the other dog in the video review does, however he gets all the squirrels out and carries them around and lightly chews/plays with them. I'm sure if I continuously put the squirrels back in after he got them out it would seem he was playing more actively with it, but I just do it once then let him have the squirrels. My dog always chews soft toys to shreds very fast, but for some reason he takes ""care"" of these squirrels and the stump is very thick and well made. I am very happy with this toy and my dog is too! And I recommend the platypus and the squirrel mat by this brand as well. My dog loves all three of these items!"
6992,Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue,0/0,5.0,"The first time I smelled this, I knew I had to get it for my wife. It is such a fresh aroma, not overpowering. Love it"

6994,Lionel FasTrack Outer Passing Loop Add On Track Pack,0/0,4.0,i was about to say 100% satisfied until I tried to use the manual switch actuator. It was worse when my grandson tried to operate the actuator. he normally has a light touch with most things but these lasted less than ten minutes. Plastic is not the answer. these parts need to be metal ! Offering an electric actuator would be a great option also.
6995,Bible Big Deal Mad Gab Card Game,0/0,5.0,This is really a family and friends fun game. I tried it on everybody and they love it. Someone is always asking try me...

6997,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Dogs and Puppies,0/0,1.0,"On October 26th 2012 I ordered the same exact Frontline Plus I order from Amazon every 6 months. I have ordered my Frontline direct from Amazon LLC (never a 3rd party vendor) for over two years and never had a problem, until now.When I initially opened the package I found the blister packs were different then normal, not necessarily a big deal as manufactures regularly change their packaging. However, when I cracked open the vile the smell of the product was noticeably different so I decided to contact Merial directly and see if they had changed their packaging. The Merial rep said they had not and asked me to confirm several other aspects of the packaging. The serial numbers actually matched correctly for the US product however she agreed the blister pack sounded odd so she asked I mail them the remaining viles and box for evaluation; Merial case # 12-117630 for any doubters.On January 10th I was contacted by Merial and they confirmed that the product is counterfeit and a very good one with matching serial numbers! To be fair to Amazon I contacted them today and they have refunded my money however there could be many other customers that have made this purchase and received fake product putting your dog at risk of flea infestation. I put my dogs on Comfortis as a precaution and will continue to do so until I can again find a reasonably priced supply of Frontline Plus that is not counterfeit.It is important to note the Merial rep said they do not have a direct working relationship with Amazon and the supplier is a 3rd party. It seems Amazon needs to step up its quality checks on its 3rd party suppliers!I have said my piece, caveat emptor."
6998,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,0/0,5.0,Bought this for a 6-month old pseudo-niece as a Christmas gift. In the two or so hours she had the gift she seemed completely engrossed in the toy and entertained. She had no issue comprehending what to do with it and was playing within a minute of first touching the toy.
6999,Rearview Spy Glasses Mirror Vision - See What's Behind You!,0/0,3.0,The work but are a little difficult to use. Your heads needs to be in the exact correct position in order to see whats going on behind you. Fun spy gadget for kids. My kids like it and they are ages 7 and 9.
7000,La Cross Tweezer Tini Point Tip # 71928,0/0,5.0,"My wife bought a pair of these tweezers once on vacation, and they became her favorite tweezers. She used them for several years, but then lost them. She went through several sets of other brands of tweezers until I found these for her through Amazon. She says the point tips on these are great, strong, and out-perform all other brands that she has ever tried. AND, they have a lifetime guarantee!"
7001,Epi-Otic Ear Cleaner 16 oz.,0/0,5.0,This is a good deal and the order was shipped to me quickly. This cleaner is vet recommended and really works.
7002,Energizer ECR2450 6 Batteries,0/0,5.0,"I thought I was only ordering 1 battery, and at that price I was happy. After it arrived I saw 6 and had to recheck the listing and found out that was correct. Excellent price and shipping was fast. I use these for my Harley security system fob, and having extras is only a plus. Highly recommended."
7003,"Solgar - Vitamin B6, 25 mg, 100 tablets",0/1,5.0,The brand is excellent. I will continue to purchase my vitamins online from this company as they are gluten free.
7004,Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard,0/0,5.0,"We have a 2008 home one screw outlets. These fit great -- they cover the entire area that the old outlet covers did (no worries about touch-up painting needed) and the little covers slide smoothly (but not do easy that my child could move them).I was worried that big plugs might fall out of this, but so far the only time a plug has fallen out was when the vacuum cleaner cord was plugged in and the cord was stretched too far.These look nice - they do not look like you baby proofed your house. And, they eliminate the need for plug covers that could become choking hazards if your child was able to pull these out (we have exclusively these in my child's room for that reason)."
7005,Passion Perfume by Elizabeth Taylor for women Personal Fragrances,1/1,5.0,I have worn this product for over twenty years and I still get compliments each time i have it on.
7006,"Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box",0/0,5.0,These cherries are great. They are fresh and so good. They arrived the next day. I have eaten this companies cherries for almost 10 years. They are consistently of the highest quality. They are completely organic and cost much less than those in the health food stores. I would recommend these to all.

7009,Tend Skin,1/1,1.0,"As other reviews have stated, this product did not work at all for me. Zero results whatsoever. I gave this a fair amount of time (3 weeks) to work before I posted a review. This product was a complete waste of time and money for me. I regret the purchase and I do not recommend it."
7010,Herbavita - Hair Color,0/0,5.0,"I am so happy with this hair color. It was easy to apply (need to supply own application bottle) but it wasn't as runny as some reviewers made it out to be. It wasn't messy at all and I was able to go about my daily business while I waited to wash it out. I should note that this does not make your hair super soft like the chemical laden ones to. In fact, before I put the conditioner on, I was worried my hair was always going to feel like hay. The conditioner softened it up a great deal. I will be using this again as it covered all my grey!"
7011,Kwik Stop Powder,1/1,5.0,This will help stop the bleeding fast if you hit your dog's quick by accident and I love that it says it numbs the pain of the cut as well. Many professionals use these products to minimize pain and maximize the clotting time when a dog gets it's quick cut.

At first I was a skeptical, complaining and nagging to her, I thought it was going to be really gross with a grimy taste but it was the complete opposite! I finished the 3lb bag and as a teenager I forgot all about it. Now as a young adult I remembered how lovely this product was, I ordered it having Amazon Prime"

7015,Herb Pharm Stone Breaker Compound,0/0,5.0,"After having two kidney stone attacks, and lithotripsy done two times (nearly $50,000 for those) I have found that using the drops twice a day at least, and more if I eat anything like spinach or kale. My stones are calcium oxilate based, so the great greens I love are harder on my body. But with an extra dropper of this I am fine. Have really tried the diet modification between the episodes, and diet alone did nothing. Going for my checkup in Feb and I will be eager to see what my x-rays show at that time. I certainly passed tons of gravel after the last lithotrispy procedure."
7016,Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash,0/0,5.0,"Great face wash. I have combination skin and have tried everything from Pro-Activ to Clinique. But I started using this and my skin has never been better, exfoliating but still gentle enough to use everyday."
7017,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"Been buying it a lot lately. The larger barrels are a better value if you can find them. The taste is very smooth and as far as protein goes, it's the biggest bang for my buck where it doesn't taste terrible or upset my stomach."
7018,DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail,0/0,5.0,This crib is amazing. It is very well made and extremely beautiful. All parts were received and assembly was a breeze. I highly recommend this crib!!!!
7019,"Dwarf Powderpuff Pre-Bonsai Starter Plant - CALLIANDRA - 4"" Pot",0/0,3.0,"It was healthy when I received it. I spent the rest of summer outside in a reasonably shady spot. It was not hardy to a Utah winter so it cam into the house and lived under the lights. Part way through the winter, it up and died. I don't know why. I kept it adequately watered. It was a pretty tree while it was alive."
7020,Sinclair Australian Shepherd,0/0,5.0,The attention to detail in this piece is incredible. I expected most of the colors to be painted on but low and behold the different patches of fabric come together to make a great looking piece. The Merle is great!
7021,"Buf-Puf Reusable Facial Sponge, Extra Gentle, - 1 ea",0/0,5.0,I've used these as my go-to facial cleanser for years. The Extra Gentle is best for sensitive skin. There's no need for facial masks or a cleanser with &#34;grit&#34; when using these as they slough dead skin without abrasives.
7022,Crystal Body Deodorant Crystal Stick For Men,0/0,4.0,The stick arrived from AmericaRx bouncing around in a too-large box with a tiny bit of padding; of course the crystal stick was broken in half. Makes it hard to use..... has anyone found a way to glue the stick back together? Leave me a comment if you have.The product works fine; no stinging or rash so far (1 week). Odor controlled without a perfume smell - nice. We'll see if it prevents yellow pit stains on white shirts.

7024,Multidophilus 12,0/0,5.0,I have purchased these probiotics several times and like them very much. Other than tending to float when I try to swallow them they are very good.
7025,Nature's Answer Slumber,1/1,5.0,"This product works pretty well. I had difficulty finding alcohol-free night time products and so I was happy to find this. Prior, I had tried Valerian by itself and well, for a few reasons that didn't work. But for some reason, this does. I know it has valerian in it but the taste is better and I pair it with an alcohol free California Poppy (found here on Amazon) and I think they compliment each other. My sleep has improved quite a bit and I don't wake up drowsy.Like many sleep products, I did have to try different amounts to find which worked best for me. After waking up too tired, or waking in the middle of the night, I found that 4/5 drops works just right in my water. If I do wake (infrequently) in the middle of the night, I still drink from the water that has the drops in it and I fall back to sleep within about 10 minutes. I'm quite happy with this product.I have already recommended this to a friend, and I continue to buy it for myself.*I'm not sure why but the cap frequently leaks. When you shake it, just hold a tissue over the top so it won't run."
7026,Calcium Vanilla Malted Milk Balls - 180 - Chewable,0/0,4.0,This item is good. The taste is not bad. But I dont know why every time I take it I feel sick.
7027,Grapeseed Oil 4 Ounces,0/0,5.0,Of all the oils I've tried this is the lightest and fastest absorbing. The Now Company seems to make quality products. I have already repurchased this item. I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions at all.
7028,Manic Panic Semi Permanent Hair Color Cream Electric Banana 4 Oz,0/0,2.0,"Product came in a box properly packed with bubble wrap, but it was open and there was dye all over the box!

7030,Cocoa Chocolate Lab,0/0,5.0,"Bought as my five-year-old sister's Christmas present. Fluffy, soft, cute--I would buy it for myself. Note that it's darker than pictured, but not by much. That said, the picture does not do it justice."
7031,Motherlove,0/0,5.0,"Got Milk?After adding this to your milk maid tea, regular tea, or just some hot water, you will be producing again! My milk was nearly gone, and I usually use this in combination every other day with Milkmaid tea. You will be able to determine after a few tries how often and how much to take. My milk is back, and my 5 month old is growing big and strong.It tastes awful, but giving your baby breast milk is worth a bad taste in your mouth for 30 seconds! This is great stuff."
7032,"Gold Edible Glitter, .25 oz",0/0,3.0,"The glitter is nice, but it is more yellow than gold in color when added to white frosting on my cupcakes."
7033,CholestOff,0/0,5.0,Very fine product for people trying to lower cholesterol. The price is excellent. I've only found CholestOff at Sam's Club at this price but it isn't sold there anymore.

7036,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,Something safe yet encourages interest and creativity. Glad I bought the upgrade kit at the same time. My 9 year old grandson found this to be one of his favorite Christmas toys.
7037,Midwest Quiet Time Pet Bed,1/1,1.0,"these beds shed really bad. i have to vacuum it daily. Anytime my dog lays on it, he comes away covered in splotches of white fuzz balls from this pet bed."
7038,Panasonic Ladies Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads,0/0,2.0,"Does not grip hair well, ended up buying the silk epil again. I only used it in the dry. Overall the length of the head is too narrow, not efficient."

7043,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,we have a siberian huskey ..he four yrs old. i started to notice around the age 3 that he had some small black spots on the top of his teeth closest to his gum. i started buying these from pets mart and they started going away. he loves them! we give him them about once or twice a week during the week days.
7044,PALOMA PICASSO For Women By PALOMA PICASSO Eau de Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,"Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor."
7045,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,"These diapers have a weird high-cut fit, and our 2 1/2 year old has peed through them ENORMOUSLY both of the first two nights he wore them. Wet down to his feet. They just don't seem to have enough absorbency for the job."
7046,You & Me,0/0,4.0,Lots of little knick knacks for the kids to play with but I feel it is overpriced. My daughter loves to play with all of the toys so I guess that is all that matters!
7047,5-Piece Tote Set - Lemon/Chocolate,0/0,4.0,"This is a great set, i LOVE it! But the color is not how it looks in the picture, it is almost a neon green, very bright! While it is a fun color, you definitely wont lose it, i was hoping for a more neutral color. I am going to exchange it for a different color."
7048,Sulcabrush Replacement Tips,0/0,4.0,LIke I said. I like the sulcabrush handle/tips and I will purchase a set for my daughter. I feel lucky to find this product.
7049,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,This product is great.. My 2yr old LOVES it she falls asleep with it everynight. She even had to carry it on our trip out of state to visit her nana. I would def. recomend this product for everyone that has toddlers or even younger children.
7050,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure,0/0,5.0,"The product arrived as advertized, on time, and in tact. This Jojoba is precisely what it is supposed to be, a quality carrier oil at an excellent price."
7051,Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac with Insert and Strap,1/1,2.0,"This pad is not that great. I was looking for back support, but it pushes you forward so far that the rest of your back cannot rest on the seat. While it does leave your lower back supported, the top of your back can be overly stressed on long trips."
7052,"Kong Catnip Cat Toy, Squirrel",1/1,5.0,"It has survived three fully clawed cats, and that's enough. They have 'killed' this squirrel so much that they keep walking away catnipped and confused, but pounce on it again the next day and start bunny-kicking again."
7053,Jobar Plaid Dust Mop Slippers,0/0,4.0,"My daughter has a tendency to lay on the hardwoods with a sweater or jacket on and scoot around, so she's gotten a certain amount of teasing for being the human dust mop. These slippers made a great novelty gift at Christmas, and they came with lots of laughs. She actually wears them from time to time and skates around, but their value as a household cleaning item under these circumstances is probably negligible."
7054,"Can You Imagine Pocket Plasma with Clip, Blue",0/0,5.0,"I have the ""big brother"" of this light and this one is just as cool!! It's neat that you can operate it with batteries and carry it around with you at night! Again, I cant wait to go to camp and show off my toys :-) My dear sis bought me this for Christmas, and I fell in love with it, and ordered another one so I would have two! :-) Enjoy"
7055,American Crew Fiber,0/0,5.0,i have been using the fiber for years and love it. it is the perfect balance between shine/hold/feel. Make sure hair is almost dry to get the best combo.
7056,"Swiffer WetJet Spray, Mop Floor Cleaner Starter Kit (Packaging May Vary)",0/0,4.0,"I have three young children and my house is constantly getting dirty. At the end of the day, once kiddies are in bed and dinner is cleared up, all I want is the quickest and most efficient way to get the kitchen and dining room floors clean. I had the swiffer for a year, and didn't like the streaky residue on my dining room so I then tried the reveal.Pros -- That microfiber really picks up the little dirt particles and the floor dries with a smooth finish.Cons -- The microfiber didn't do well on stuck on grime - it would simply glide over the blotches on my kitchen floor. The spray nozzle is several inches above the floor and ejects this fine mist that doesn't have the same ooomph as the swiffer. And most of all, you have to constantly pump the handle to spray... At the end of the day, I just want to get the job done, and the constant pumping was tiring and annoying. I'm quite OK having batteries do the job for me!Solution"
7057,Colgate Colgate Full Head Toothbrush Classic Soft,0/0,2.0,"The product I received had irritating grooves along the brush face opposite the bristles. This caused a nasty canker sore to develop on the inside of my lower lip. If you think you would be sensitive in this area then this brush will rub you wrong way. Due to Amazon's inept product descriptions and inaccurate low-resolution graphics, I've resorted to buying toothbrushes the old-fashioned way at the grocery store."
7058,Roux Fanci-full Rinse #41 True Steel,0/0,4.0,"I had used Roux color before and liked it. Now my hair is all white, I need to put some color in it to make it look fuller. I chose #41 True Steel and love it. I do not like to permanently dye my hair, so this is the product for me."
7059,Pet-Tabs Plus Supplement for Dogs,0/0,2.0,Was very disappointed that the vitamins were expired when I received them. Would not recommend purchasing this particular item to anyone.
7060,Match It,0/0,5.0,"According to his dad, ever since the gift arrived the birthday boy and his brother have played with it daily and love it!"
7061,OPI Brights!,0/0,5.0,"OPI is a great polish, and this is a great color! I love it, and wear it all the time!"
7062,"V.SmileTM Deluxe TV Learning System, Console, 2 Joystick, 1 Smartridges & Adaptor",0/0,1.0,"I remember when I bought this how angry I was that it did not come with a power adapter. What kind of a company would do that? Then, the power button did not work. I returned it two times. Same thing! I'm sure other parents had the same problem therefore. Indeed, reviews bear this out. This toy or company won awards I think. I couldn't believe it! Several years later, I just tried using it again for my younger children. Now, even the controllers do not work well. The games themselves also have a very low budget ""feel"" to them. The whole thing is junk. As a result, I decided I will never buy any vtech product again, phones included, and have not since. Too, bad, the toy had potential to be a good learning tool."
7063,Bump Fighter Refill Cartridge Blade - 5 Ea / Pack,0/0,5.0,I love the product. It is unfortunate that the local stores no longer carry the product but I am glad that I can obtain this item via Amazon.com at a economical price. The product is an excellent product that keeps bumps from appearing on African American Men that have to shave daily. I highly recommend it.
7064,RID-X - Septic System Treatment 1-Dose Powder 9.8 Ounce,0/0,5.0,"After moving from the city & having a life of a city water supply, & no worries using the garbage disposal, I move to the woods...now I have a septic system. I had MANY mishaps the first few years...& after numerous & quite expensive &#34;dates&#34; with my plumber, I heard about Rid-X. I started using it, & felt very comfortable that my system was happy...only one problem,I'd forget to buy it every now & then, or the store didn't carry it, & I wasn't as reverent with the process as I should have been.Then Amazon.com came to my rescue. I now have a monthly delivery right to my door & the day it is delivered is the day it's putto use. Now, I never miss a month, I don't worry as much about my septic system, & I've been able to lose the plumber!"
7065,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,im not much of a red girl but i saw this and thought it looked nice when i received it and tried it on i fell in love! it is the perfect red i want to buy ten of them so i never run out!
7066,"5 Second Brush On Nail Glue, 54006, IBD / Nail Treatments",1/1,2.0,"was excited to get this product in and was very disappointed. I dont know if I just got a bad one but it would not stick. So I decided to try to feel out the glue with my fingers and it wasnt even sticky!! Like I said I must have gotten a bad one. Wont got through the trouble of returning, just gonna count it as a loss."
7067,"Innotek UltraSmart Remote Trainer, 300YDS",0/0,5.0,"We learned our lesson the hard way with our first beagle. When we purchased our newest miniture beagle puppy, we knew we needed to purchase this Innotek UltraSmart Remote Trainer, 300YDS, before our first trip to Vermont. This unit has never given us a problem."
7068,Pure Purple Perfume - EDP Spray 3.0 oz. by Hugo Boss - Women's,0/0,4.0,"Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido. Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones"
7069,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,This came quickly is made to fit well into all Cylinder based meals carriers like the Bento meals from Zojirushi or Tiger. definitely makes regularly cleaning much simpler and faster if you pack your meal carriers a fair bit like I do. nothing defective or cheap about the brush. Good cleaning tool.
7070,Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea - 3.53 oz. Loose Tea Tin,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love strong tea in the morning. This Irish Breakfast tea does the trick. I use it in the refillable k-cup of my Keurig and it comes out perfect, even after adding a little frothed milk or creamer."
7071,Sinus Buster Classic Formula by Sinus Buster - .68 Ounces,0/0,5.0,I bought Sinus Buster Classic Formula and Sinol M with Capsaicin. The Sinol M did not help. The Sinus Buster does help. It helps a lot but only for a few hours after 4-5 sprays. I like it because decongestants and antihistamine don't seem to help at all. Saline spray is helpful but nowhere near as good as Sinus Buster. It burns a little; I'm starting to enjoy the burn.
7072,Herbal Magic Roll-On Deodorant Jasmine 3 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I've tried Crystal Essence Pomegranate Roll on Deodorant and that works OK, as well as Kiss my Face Sport Deodorant. Both of these don't even compare to Herbal Magic! It works the best so far...goes on well and isn't sticky, seems to cover odor very well but I'm sure if I were to workout I would need to reapply. Wish there were more scents, but the Jasmine does seem to do a good job at covering odor. It fades throughout the day too so after a couple hours it's a very mild but good smell."
7073,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,0/0,5.0,I love the seventh generation wipes- good density in the wipe and plenty of cleaning fluid to work. Never irritated my son's skin and I feel secure that the wipes are safe for him and the environment. I also was able to get this box of 350 count for around 11 dollars which is a snapping deal. I particularly like that they come in packs of 70 wipes so that the packs can be used without drying out straight from their resealable top.
7074,"Blistex DCT, .25-Ounce Pots (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I've been using DCT for years and years. I like that it's got sun protection, as well as vitamin A, vitamin E, cocoa butter and aloe. Feels good. Goes on smooth. What's not to like?"
7075,"Zout Triple Enzyme Formula Laundry Stain Remover Foam, 22 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"It happens not so often when promising product keeps its promise. This one does. If you don't like stained clothes - it will work for you. Using Zout I was able to remove even very old (probably years)oil spot from the clothes. Fix everything! May be I just luky and did not have the real stain yet, but I have been using Zout for 5 years at least including baby and kids clothes... Smell? Yes, but not worse than your Windex and better than Clorox. Never smell Zout after washing."
7076,Softheat Softheat Heating Pad Moist Or Dry King Size,0/0,4.0,"I had ordered a different brand, but this is simular. Not a soft as the one I had. It shuts off after about an hour which is perfect. very happy with it."
7077,Ring-a-Links by Infantino,0/0,5.0,"Nothing else to say except I love them. We had 2 other brands and this one was the most colorful, and the soft rubbery parts on the oval shaped pieces were really nice for baby's gums."
7078,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,0/0,5.0,"I love the rainforest jumperoo!! I got it just a few days after ordering. Very easy to set up. My daughter has been using this for a month now. She is now four months. It has a great head support. Very bright, colorful and just super cute! My daughter has loved it since day one!!"
7079,"Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Indoor Adult 27 Formula, 15-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"I've been feeding my Bengal this food his whole life. I notice a major difference if we run out and he eats other food. His litter box stinks to high heaven, this is supposed to be easier to digest and stink less. The little domestic shorthair I adopted has had much improved fur quality"
7080,Petmate Pet Porter 2 Kennel,0/0,4.0,"Based on the many dog kennels out there this was a good find at an average price. We had a pup flown to us and it held up well in the cargo area, meeting all flight stipulations. We have continued to use it with no complaints at this time."
7081,Herb Pharm Lobelia Skunk Cabbage,0/0,5.0,"This was prescribed for me back in 1995 for a seizure disorder and it worked great. I decided to search for it again and once again use it in combination with my medicine. Take their word for it, it is HOT due to cayenne being in it but it does work. This product is hard to find and when you do find it, the prices is usually higher than this merchant. Many thanks."
7082,Fun-to-Know Puzzles,0/0,5.0,"Almost-4-year-old loves this puzzle. I like that it has the picture and the word on the other side, so it's good for older children, too."
7083,Aspen Mulling Spices Eggnog Mix (1 carton),0/0,5.0,Better than the PDQ eggnog crystals I have been missing. Stir and let sit a bit to thicken. THICKENS! Add a little nutmeg and guzzle.
7084,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,Great gift. The quality is pretty good especially for the price. Each of the squirels looks a bit different and the tree is cute.
7085,Hugo Boss Hugo,0/0,3.0,"never really got a chance to wear it ,box was damage with the product before i could open it ...im sad because i wanted to know wht it smelled like without the box smell taking over it"
7086,"Precision Pet SnooZZy Sleeper Mat, Black",0/0,5.0,My Australian Shepard/collie mix likes this crate mat a lot. I bought it as I wanted something for him to sleep on that fits the entire crate floor so he would be comfy but not too warm. It fits perfectly in his intermediate crate and he hasn't chewed it yet which is great. I will definitely buy it again for his other crate.
7087,Apple Cider Vinegar by American Health 200 Tablets,0/0,5.0,I was having horrible foot cramps during the night and started taking these Apple Cider Vinegar tablets (2 in the morning and 2 with dinner) and the foot cramps have disappeared. I praise the Lord for this miracle and the product is an excellent buy!
7088,Natures Gate Conditioner Moisturizing Aloe Vera 18 oz,0/0,5.0,"I bought this in a store once and since then, it is my every day conditioner.It leaves your hair smooth but not heavy.It's natural.I recommend this product."
7089,Rat-A-Tat-Cat,0/0,5.0,This is a great game for a family...I enjoy playing with my 6 & 8 yr old... Great for a family game night activity
7090,Beetle Juice (1988),0/0,5.0,Great Movie and Great Buy! Excellent quality and a wonderfully funny movie. Definetly worth the money I paid for it.
7091,Trivial Pursuit,0/0,4.0,Came in good condition even though it was used. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to buy this game used and not pay a lot of money.
7092,Radio Flyer 32S All-Terrain Steel and Wood Wagon,0/0,5.0,"Purchased this for my son for our grandson, works very well and on all terrain. Would recommend this product in the future."
7093,"Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, 3.0 - Ounces Tube (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,I have been using Cetaphil products for the last 15 years. These tubes are great to carry around and fit easily in my purse. The cream can be used on face or body. It is unscented and is very easy on my sensitive skin.
7094,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,5.0,"The color is absolutely wonderful. This stethoscope is well made and durable. As an RN, I have been using it for about 3 years now and it is still like I just bought it. Cleans easily and sound is clear. Would recommend."
7095,Red Bull Energy Drink (Pack of 24),0/0,3.0,This is by far the best tasting RedBull and buying it this way is cheaper than buying singles or even a four pack from the store. Not sure why they are so much more than the Sugar Free though...
7096,Moisturel Moisturel Therapeutic Lotion Fragrance Free,0/0,5.0,I've been using Moisturel for many years due to exzema. It's the only lotion I can use on my skin that doesn't irritate my skin. It's a great product and I save money buying through Amazon.
7097,"Cats Rule Fish Watering Hole Fountain, Blue and White",0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my cat since she is always bugging me to turn the faucet on so she can drink out of it. She loves the fountain and drinks way more during the day than she used. Easy to set up, works great."
7098,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/1,5.0,"I was looking for a Dandelion Root tea that I could stand to drink sans cream or sugar without gagging. The Traditional Medicinals brand is way too strong tasting, but Alvita has a lovely mild taste, slight bitters but not disgusting. I recommend it if you are looking for a good dandelion root tea."
7099,Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,0/0,5.0,My son has been collecting stuffies since he was a baby and he doesn't like to part with them. This is the best solution for the both of us. He gets to keep (most) of his stuffies and I get them off the floor!
7100,"Duro-Med Aluminum Reacher with Magnetic Tip, 26 Inch",0/0,5.0,"all good the grabber is handy, not much to say its a simple devise, easy to get to hard to reach items"
7101,Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,0/0,5.0,"I have a new baby and a two year old, this stroller is all we need. I own a Combi double as well but use the Joovy all of the time. My toddler prefers to stand instead of sitting. It is small enough to go through aisles or smaller places. I use it with my Chicco car seat and it fits perfectly. Wonderful stroller for aby and older child. Well made. Holds enough down below but not a huge bag. I highly recommend. Easy to put in trunk but my only con is that it does not stand up alone when folded and no cup holder."
7102,Runts Candy Bulk By Wonka 5lb,0/0,3.0,"The candy was ok. Not great, and not the original (missing the strawberry and blue flavors!) I didn't think the flavors were as good as the originals, either. I am trying to order another listing, that is by 'Runts', to see if it better. The picture on this one is accurate, I hope the new order will be accurate to the picture as well, as it includes the two missing flavors in the picture as well as the original Runts name. Beware, and check it out, I am sorry I missed doing so."
7103,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"I've been searching for an X-Large bed for so long! Most of the &#34;X-Large&#34; beds that are being sold are just too small. I have a 165 lb. German Shepard and before this bed the poor guy had to pick which part of his body he would put on the bed. He ended up using most of them as pillows for his head. He fits on this bed with room to stretch out and has a bit to spare. Wonderful!! But if your dog is not an &#34;X-Large&#34; you might want to go a size smaller. My dog can easily rest his head on the kitchen counters, you do not have to bend over to pet him, and occasionally grabs the couch by an armrest to drag around the living room for fun."
7104,TIGI S-Factor Smoothing Lusterizer Defrizzer & Tamer Hair Styling Serums,0/0,5.0,"This product is awesome, I use it in my wet hair (short pixie-style cut) every morning after I shower. It keeps the frizz at bay and holds a style while I blow-dry. Highly recommend!!!"
7105,"Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Case of 6)",0/0,2.0,"I really wish I could love Mrs. Meyer's body products. I think they smell amazing, but good grief, my skin has never been so dry than when using these products. I have tried the hand soap in Basil, Parsley and Lavender - all smell great, all leave my hands literally cracking and peeling from dryness. I have also tried the bar soap for use in the shower - same thing - Smells great, leaves my skin ashy, white and flaky. I don't have sensitive skin either, it's just something in these products that strip my skin down to nothing. Maybe you'll have better luck, but I don't recommend this product to anyone with dry or sensitive skin."
7106,"Heath Candy Bar, Milk Chocolate & English Toffee, 2.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 18)",1/1,1.0,"I received this product and every individual piece was broken into dozens of little pieces. It was not the packaging (box was not crushed at all), and Amazon's packing was fine. I think Heath sells this as seconds. They really should let people know before they sells them that these are seconds."
7107,Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS Game,0/0,5.0,"I totally remember this game from when I was a kid so I was excited to get it for my boys, hoping they would love it. I was very happy when they started playing with it right away. It was easy to put together and they were able to start pounding away at it right away. The only downside to it is that it doesn't fit back into the box once it's put together. Great game though."
7108,Classic Wood Folding Chess Set,0/0,5.0,Exactly what my grandson ordered. He loves it as he is an avid chess player and likes to take ithe chess set wherever he goes.
7109,"A + D Original Ointment Jar, Diaper Rash and All-Purpose Skincare Formula - 1 lb",0/0,5.0,"Really great product, better than cream. A lot easier to clean from hands and keeps the baby dry and happy."
7110,ROYALL SPYCE by Royall Fragrances AFTERSHAVE LOTION COLOGNE 8 OZ for MEN,0/0,5.0,"My hubby's favorite, and one I enjoy on him. This has the same great quality we've grown to expect thru the years."
7111,"Versus Blue Jeans By Gianni Versace For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5-Ounces",0/0,4.0,My hubby mentioned he used to love this back in the day. I'm glad I found it. I gave it to him for Xmas and head has worn it everyday since. Lol
7112,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,im not much of a red girl but i saw this and thought it looked nice when i received it and tried it on i fell in love! it is the perfect red i want to buy ten of them so i never run out!
7113,"LEGO Duplo Green Building Plate (15"" X 15"")",0/0,5.0,"We bought a little end table that's only a few inches larger than this square. I'd planned on velcroing it down so we'd still have the option to use the table for other things, but the kids (ages 18mos and 2 1/2) never had any trouble with leaving it on the table. It's come off occasionally, granted, and has seen it's share of mild abuse--still in great condition for all that."
7114,Romeo Britto Britto Man Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Item was exactly what I wanted, arrived fast and was the best price I could find it anywhere. Now I smell awesome lol."
7115,ZOOBMobile Car Designer 76,0/0,5.0,These are so easy to build and so fun to play with. Follow the directions or build you own. Best part is they are guaranteed. If they break you can send them back. We love these things!
7116,Double Nine Dominoes,0/0,2.0,"I can't fault the advertising, they are double-nine dominoes, and they are wood. They are also very small, about half as big as what I would consider normal dominoes. Not what I was expecting, somewhat disappointed."
7117,Penthouse Secrets Collection Golden Nugget 5X Body Massager,0/0,1.0,This is NOT as advertised. These 'massagers' are cheap for a reason. It says it is a 9V battery and that it is included. It doesn't even take 9V battery -- takes 2 AA which = no power. Don't waste your time.
7118,"Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)",1/1,1.0,"Rich dark chocolate but not sweet at all. If you like hot chocolate from restaurants or theme parks like Disneyland, avoid this. As a person who loves Ghiradelli Ice Cream and chocolate candy, I was extremely disappointed."
7119,Bausch and Lomb Folding Pocket Magnifier,0/0,5.0,I have used these as stock magnifiers in the coin business since 1987. It is a workhorse and meets my needs perfectly!
7120,DMAE (130mg),0/0,5.0,This is just great! It was exactly what I was looking for and at a fair price as well. I highly recommend this product.
7121,Small World Sand & Water Toys (Bucket) - Colors May Vary,0/0,5.0,"they love it!..played endlessly in the sand and waters' edge...good purchase, good value, and I'd do business with them again"
7122,Star Wars Princess Leia Keepsake Ornament,0/0,4.0,"I got this as sort of a gag gift for my husband, but he was obsessed with it and really loves it."
7123,"No Pudge! Fat Free Fudge Brownie Mix, Cappuccino, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"These are a delicious treat made with yogurt, that makes it healthy. If you can manage to not eat the whole pan it is a good way to have tasty brownies with out feeling bad. I have also had these made with black beans and thery tasted great and that would probably fill you more than the typical brownie treat. The cappuccino taste is not overwhelming but pretty subtle."
7124,"Nature's Plus - Animal Parade Acidophikidz, 90 chewable tablets",0/1,1.0,"My kids spat them out immediately. I expected that from my 3 year old, but my 7 year old isn't picky at all."
7125,100% Whey Protein - All Natural,0/0,4.0,Tastes o.k. and seems to provides the supplemental protein that I need. The price is good for whey protein powder and milk without added hormones is used.
7126,Explorer English World Globe,0/0,5.0,"My husband wanted a simple, not-too-expensive globe - especially for those times when we're watching Jeopardy. This globe is just right. The size of the globe is perfect, it is well-made, was well-packaged, and is exactly the item for which we were looking. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this purchase. We aren't."
7127,"Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ounce",0/0,5.0,it just what i wanted from a face cleanser. it even removes tough makeup and keeps my oily face without shine. would recommend this product to anyone.
7128,"The Gluten-Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This cornbread was very tasty, considering all of the modifications that I had to make to accomodate my son's food allergies (Wheat, Diary and Eggs). I made by own buttermilk by adding cider vinegar to unsweetend almond milk. I used Earth Balance's Olive Oil butter in place of the butter required. Lastly, I used Ener-G's egg replacer for the egg required. It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked so the next time I make it I will increase the sugar. It also was a tad dry. Notwithstanding, it still tasted very good. I will definately buy it again."
7129,Badger Basket Canopy Doll Crib With Baskets Bedding And Mobile - Pink/White,0/0,2.0,got it around August and a few months it was already falling apart. My girls use it alot but have been careful science they had one similar before. I hate paying alot of money for something and it fall apart so soon. I have already used super glue and clamps on this. don't waste your money.
7130,California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Jelly,0/0,2.0,It's too hard and the vibrator made me feel uncomfortable. The vibrator can not been controlled. I don't like that.
7131,Nature's Answer KID Catnip,0/0,5.0,I brought this to add to homemade skincare concoctions. I add it to h20 in a spray bottle and it's very refreshing in the summer. It's basically glycerin and chamomile and it was a good price. I assume that it is of much higher quality that cosmetic grade glycerin because it marketed for internal use by kids and babies. Worked well for my purposes.
7132,Burberry Touch For Men,0/0,5.0,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! He's obsessed with burberry touch but didn't think I would get it because of the price but this price was amazing! Super happy with this purchase :)
7133,"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory",0/0,4.0,"I have back issues pre-pregnancy, and struggled to find something comfortable enough once I got a belly (received this at 23 weeks). I do have a tempur-pedic mattress topper, so I haven't gotten the hip pain other women have complained of, but I needed something to support my knees AND ankles. I originally bought the Snoogle mini and it just didn't work -- would go between my knees, but then my ankles weren't separated so I could feel the pull on my spine.This Snoogle is great for my purposes. I can sleep on my side with the lower leg either bent or straight, and the top leg either bent or straight, with pillow support the entire way. It also feels great to have the back support and tummy support.Yes, the seam is crazy tight and hurt my shoulder at first. Then I snipped a few holes in it and it was totally fine! The cover is itchy and I didn't want to chance getting it back on correctly, so I bought a super-soft body pillowcase and pulled it over the top curve for my head. Perfect.Also"

7137,"Tortuga Caribbean Six-Pack Mix, 4-Ounce Cake (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Recently went to the Bahamas and saw these cakes in the airport. I would like to have brought some back for gifts, but was really out of room in the suitcase. Did a search on amazon and found these for less than what I would have paid there, so ordered them and handed them out for &#34;souvenirs&#34;. Much better than carrying them back! Kept one for ourself and it was very good and fresh."
7138,"KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Red",0/0,5.0,"Every night, I fill the body of the kong with dry kibble and then stuff some canned dog food in the opening and place the whole kong in the freezer. In the morning, the kong goes into the kennel with our 40lb cattle dog mix, and slowly unfreezes during the day (it is always all eaten when we get home!). We got the large for our dog, and it works perfectly for him and for our friend's 65lb Golden Retriever mix who comes over and steals it sometimes.We have also used the kong with peanut butter and other treats in the past. I find that large treats stuffed inside just frusterate the dog when he can't get it out, while peanut butter can be high in fat and non-nutritious which is why we switched to using a comination of dry and wet dog food."
7139,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Poor Lil' Rich Girl,0/0,5.0,"It was so easy to find on amazon.com. My manicurist had this color, and I loved it and wanted it for touchups. Sure beats driving all over to find it. Looks better on than in the bottle."

7148,"Purina One Cat Smartblend Salmon and Tuna Cat Food, 16-Pound",0/0,5.0,This is a review of Amazon more than a review of cat food. We are fulltime rv'ers and work in Yellowstone National Park. It's 150 miles to the nearest grocery store and Amazon has this cat food in stock. We have it shipped to us using our Prime account. The kitties really like the Purina Brand and I thank Amazon for not making me drive 300 miles.
7149,Rope Bone Dog Toy in White,1/1,5.0,I read online that you should only buy 100-percent cotton rope toy since it's digestible in your dog swallows a small bit so I was glad I could find this on Amazon. It's white so it gets dirty quickly but you can just throw it in the washing machine.
7150,"Sherpa Original Deluxe Pet Carrier, Medium, Black",0/0,4.0,Have a well behaved dog and was able to unzip the top so the dog could see me and her surroundings.
7151,Remington Tangle Tamer Wet/Dry - Cord or Cordless Convenience W/ On/off Switch,0/0,5.0,"I have very thick hair that gets tangled even when I put it up in a bun or pony-tail. I dreaded washing my hair because it was such a painful process with taking out all the tangles with a brush--which would pull out a lot of broken hair. I was amazed by this product! It saved me so much time (which I have very little of with my 3 boys running around!) The price is a steal too. Just days after using it, I had sent a couple to my family members. I'm going to bring it with me to my next salon visit--It will save my hairstylist some time too!"
7152,Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"My hair felt softer and less dry, but not oily, using this product. I have untreated well water and recommend this product if your hair has gotten dry and strawlike."

7156,Kikkoman - Instant Tofu-Spinach Miso Soup Mix (3 Pockets) - 1.05 Oz,0/0,4.0,"There are three small packets in each of three larger packages. I initially thought there was only three servings but had to open a big package to find out different.I wanted a big bowl of soup so I made two at once, with 1&1/3 cup of boiling water. Great flavor and decent consistency. The tofu is tiny little pieces. I'll add some mushroom chunks next time.Anyway, very good and if you're not worried about sodium, a no-brainier. Good stuff indeed."
7157,Tresemme Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray,1/1,5.0,I love this product so much that I can't travel away from home or spend a night without it. This is by far my favorite heat protectant that I have ever used. It also smells really nice and makes your hair feel soft wtihout the sticky gritty feeling.
7158,Small World Living Toys Peel 'N' Play,0/0,5.0,"Both my boys enjoy playing with the food. They love cooking with me, but they are too young to use knives.

7160,"Source Naturals GABA Calm, Orange",1/1,5.0,"The Orange flavor is MUCH more pleasing than the mint flavored gaba calm. These really do work for me. After a long stressful day is when I feel the most affect. I usually combine with 5 mg of melatonin before I go to bed. Recently, I used them after a few of the NFL playoff games...definitely took the edge off. The sting is still there though."
7161,Care Bear Hi Pile Blanket,0/0,5.0,This blanket passed my expectations. I was worried it wouldn't be good cuz its so cheap in price. But this blanket is soft and wonderful
7162,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,"I am Asian, Light-Medium skin with a yellow undertone, and I have to say that I have finally found the natural nail polish color I have been on the search for in the form of Zoya's Grace. The application is wonderful (no streaks!) but it does take up to 3 coats to get, not bottle color, but some opacity. Anyway, I still love Zoya and their mission of non-toxic nail polish."
7163,Graco DuoGlider LX Stroller,0/0,5.0,This stroller was ready to assemble. It is very roomy and easy to adjust. The seats recline to a comfortable position and can be done with one hand.

7165,Wella Color Charm Liquid Permanent Hair Color,0/0,5.0,"I had read so many places that YOU MUST TONE AFTER BLEACHING, but I didn't think too much of it. I thought that purple shampoo would be enough to give me a cool-toned look. But I've used this once now, and I know I'm hooked for life! This makes my blonde the perfect white-blonde I've been looking for. It TOTALLY surpasses any purple shampooing or conditioning, or anything else you can think of to make your hair the color you really want.JUST BUY IT ALREADY!"

It was a very tough and fatty piece of meat.I have ordered and purchased lamb hundreds of times and this was by far the worst. I am so disappointed and upset by this.It ruined our holiday because we were all so excited about have this leg of lamb and it was so tough and fatty, that no one wanted to eat it. I threw 95% of it out.I will NEVER order from this company again.Don't waste your money."

7174,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 10-Piece Alphabet Nesting and Stacking Blocks,0/0,5.0,We got these blocks as a gift for my sons 1st birthday. My son loved stacking them and nocking them down. The nesting feature is great because the blocks are easier to stack for a 1 yr old and they are very compact for taking anywhere you go. The blocks are pretty sturdy and have taken a beating from my son and held up great. We have only had a rip on one the letters because my son had gotten really good at peeling stickers.We recently just purchased a set for my best friends 1yr old son and would recommend them to anyone.
7175,Pete the Repeat Parrot,0/0,2.0,"Not very good quality. The Parrots voice is garbled, doesn't really seem to work properly. I bought this for my grandson but am disappointed with it. Seems to work hit and miss."
7176,Hot Wheels Monster Jam Truck Case,0/0,5.0,"Great case! Love the way it holds the truck. Wish they would make a bigger one or a double sided one! It holds about 15 trucks, but that is only about 1/4 of the amount of trucks my son has. Not enough for the fanatics!"
7177,NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"I picked this up being it was rated well, I also picked up the well rated Nautica Blue at the same time to compare and all I can say is WOW, stay away from Blue and stick with Voyage, world of difference!This stuff smells great, but is not in your face and lasts all day easily. Highly recommend."
7178,Step 2 Up & Down Roller Coaster,0/0,5.0,I bought this coaster for my grandson for Christmas. He is age 2 and his brother is 4. They spent hours taking turns riding this. It was so heartwarming to hear them &#34;giggle&#34; and &#34;belly laugh&#34; as they rode down the hill. This is a great buy!!!

7181,Atkins Endulge Bars,0/0,5.0,TThese are really good. I even froze one and it is like a Mars Bar. I especially like Atkins Bars as they are very low in sugar if they have any at all and this is important to me since I have Diabetes.
7182,"Hodgson Mill Wholesome White Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I made this bread for Christmas gifts, and asked for true opinions, since this was the first time I'd used this mix.

7184,"Conair Hot Air Curling Combo, 1.5 Inch",0/0,5.0,"I bought it to replace my previous one that gave up one me after couple years of working hard for me. After returning the one bought in the store since it's curling iron & not what I can use, I started to look online and found exactly the same one I own before. I can't use styling products since they give me pimples on my face so I need to curl my hair while it's still damp and traveling between countries, I need dual voltage. This is the only one available but I'm pleased with the previous one so I'm glad it's still around."
7185,Kyjen Outward Hound Sling-Go Pet Sling Carrier,1/1,1.0,I have a 7lb maltese/terrier mix and this was way too flimsy for my dog. This would be good for a teacup breed or a small dog with very short legs. I returned this purchase.
7186,"simplehuman Under-Counter Pull Out Can, 30 Liters / 8 Gallons",0/0,5.0,It was so very simple to install and it works great. Add to it the very reasonable price and you have yourself a good bargain.
7187,Woodkins (Tiffany) 3,0/0,3.0,"When I ordered this I expected to get and African American woodkin. This was so pale, it might as well have been white. Nothing like the one in the picture, which I had previously owned and was replacing. Very disappointed."

7193,Solgar Formula VM-2000 Tablets (Multinutrient System),0/0,5.0,"I have used this multivitamin for quite sometime. It has vitamins, minerals, amino acids and sundry other micro nutrients. I take it to get a bit of every every possible thing that would be good for my body. You get what you pay for. I know tests have been done on other cheaper products by other vitamin vendors and their products have been found to be missing the advertised components."
7194,J.L. Childress MaxiCOOL 4 Bottle Cooler,0/0,3.0,"This cooler is fine if you need several bottles, but if you just need 1 or 2, look elsewhere. Now that our baby is older she only needs one bottle for most outings, so the bottles just tip over and leak in the cooler bag. You could put several ice packs in to hold them in place but that just adds to the weight. I have stuffed a dish towel in there to hold the bottle up but again, but it's really just too big for one or two bottles. This would have been great for a newborn who needs multiple bottles a day but for older babies, not so much."
7195,Sleep Pretty In Pink Women's Earplugs 7 Pr,0/0,5.0,This is 7 pairs. They work fabulous to block out my husband's snoring and the train (about 3 miles away) throughout the middle of the night. Would recommend!
7196,Bamboo Back Scratcher Massager Therapeutic Body Massage,0/0,5.0,"Don't know how this could go wrong, but it works fine. The back scratcher hasn't broken. Have no complaints about it."
7197,"Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black",0/0,2.0,"Out of the package it is a near perfect sleep mask. Exceptionally comfortable and blocks light except for a little bit around the nose area.Sadly, it is not washable or long lasting. OK, you could wash it but it will just fall apart more quickly. Less than three months passed before the fabric started separating away from the foam core. Now, it is useless.Too bad the mfg doesn't do something to hold the layers together because it is otherwise wonderfully lightweight, effective and comfortable. Decent price if it lasted a full year. For a throwaway however, it is overpriced."
7198,"Salerno Butter Cookies, 16-oz. box (Pack of 12)",3/3,5.0,"Hello, My name is Michael and I work at the Niles Historical Society. We recently became the recipient of most the items from the Niles Bakery, Salerno.The Grandson and Grandmother brought in a ton of memorabilia of the Salerno(Butter)Cookie company that was on Caldwell, in Niles. It has long since been sold, and the memorabilia came from the Uncle who recently passed on,and who never married.The Salerno - Magowan Cookie company, as it was first known, was famous for the EQUIPMENT Mr. Salerno made to create the cookies. We have a multitude of patents on files for making Windmills, Butter Cookies, and even a few machine patents that were very old and were granted by the Third Reich of Germany (Complete with swastika!)Later on Mr. Salerno was persuaded to stick with the cookies and crackers. Many a morning as I was growing up in Niles I would smell the baking of the cookies just a few miles away! Yummy!If you can get your hands on the cookie, please be advised that it is nothing like the original. At all.Salerno Cookie company is gone forever. If you remember the taste and quality cherish the memory!"

It is Shelly Shenbei by other brand (&#38634;&#12398;&#26376; instead of &#26106;&#26106;). They try to trick you with similar product. Same thing happen to the ""Want Want Big Shelly Senbei Natural Flavored Crispy Rice Cracker Biscuits Family Value Pack""."
7200,"Bob's Red Mill Arrowroot Starch Flour, 20-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"I started using arrowroot when I went paleo and ditched corn from my diet. Even if you aren't paleo, I would highly recommend this over regular flour or cornstarch as a thickener. It works just as well (if not better... I find it has a very light texture that dissolves well). It's great for making gluten-free baked goods crisp as well, and can be helpful in breading fish and chicken. The price is right as well, as I find most recipes and uses don't require much of the starch at all."
7201,BD DigitalThermometer,0/0,3.0,Ordered this thermometer thinking it would beep and let me know if my kids had it in the right position when I was taking their temps. However the beeping must only be a feature on the basal thermometers because this thermometer does NOT beep. I could have gone to the local drugstore and got a digital thermometer that does the same thing for cheaper.
7202,Wel-Pac - Saki Ika Hot (dried squid) 2.0 Oz.,0/0,5.0,I got the six pack of regular and then I got one pack of the hot...

7204,Hawaiian Islands Pineapple Waikiki 20 Tea Bags,0/0,3.0,"I bought this tea for my husband since I learned that pineapple can open up the breathing passages. He drank it, however, I would rather get pineapple juice and pour it in the cup of tea. I did not get much of a pineapple taste to it. I will not order again."
7205,"Ettore 71140 Professional Brass Backflip Window Cleaning Combo Tool, 14-Inch",0/0,4.0,This cleaning tool works well but I wish it were a couple inches smaller as my house has a couple windows that this tool does not fit into well. I was able to rig up a universal extension pole by drilling a hole though this tool and through the pole and then bolting them together. Would have been nice to just buy an extension pole that fit this tool but I don't think one exists.
7206,37 Key Day Care Durable,0/0,3.0,"The over all is ok. I do not like the keys you have to hit them hard so they make a sound. If you hit them like a normal keyboard or piano it will not work. good for kids that like to pound on them. Also the bench the only thing you have to assemble the holes for the bolts are to small and you cant get the bolts in, i am going to have to redrill the holes bigger. NO QUALITY CONTROL.The finish is nice."
7207,Soft 'N Style Clear Spray Bottle 16 oz. (Pack of 6),0/0,5.0,I make my own hair and skin tonics. I love this sturdy plastic bottle. The nozzle is perfect for spraying water solutions in my hair.

7211,"Syntrax Nectar Whey Protein Isolate, Powder",0/0,5.0,This product is very good. Reminds me of my childhood drink Tang but with protein. Wouldn't know your drinking protein at all.
7212,Sunbeam 732-500 King Size Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,0/0,5.0,"Our previous Sunbeam pad had electronic controls-with printed circuits, etc. which went bad. Keep it simple with the simple switches like this pad has for fewer problems and longer life. You don't need complicated electronic circuits for controls for Low, Medium & High to turn on and off simple appliances like this. More parts to go bad. So far this does the job really well - time will tell if it has just one crappy component made in China that was made poorly and will make our pad an early candidate for the landfill. Got this item from Amazon in 24 hours - as usual, impeccable service, delivery, etc. Now I'm spoiled because we expect no less."
7213,Now Foods Lemon Oil,4/4,5.0,"This NOW Foods Lemon Oil is a great essential oil to use singularly with a carrier oil, (I most often use almond oil as my carrier), mixing with other essential oils to create a custom scent for your skin, room freshening/deodorizing, and for making your own homemade cleaning products that leave a fabulous scent behind.The lemon scent itself is clean and bright with no heaviness or odd undertones, and is a great scent to help perk you up. I enjoy mixing this with orange oil with almond oil, and dab on pulse points (that will not be exposed to sunlight, as these essential oils can cause skin irritation for many when exposed to sunlight).In case you don't know, this doesn't come with it's own dropper, so you may want to have one ready. The quality, strength, scent, value and ""multi-purposefulness"" of this lemon oil has made a wonderful addition to my essential oil stock and I highly recommend it!"
7214,"Neutral Regulator, 500 g / 1.1 lbs",0/0,5.0,"This stuff is great. Not only does it keep Ph right around 7, it removes chlorine and chloramine from tap water. Seachem seems to be a good company as well."
7215,"Rainbow Light, Multivitamin",1/1,5.0,"I ordered "" RejuvenAge 40+ Multi"" which requires 4 pills per day. I have a hard time taking vitamins in the past. Either I get a migraine headaches or an upset stomach. My head would be pounding so hard that I had to lay down or the nausea so strong I felt a need to vomit. I would watch my urine go from almost clear to a ""deep orange"". I could smell the dreaded stench vitamin smell in my urine.I tried GNC Women's Mega, I got the same results. I thought if I paid more for the vitamins the quality was better.I haven't had any of these negative reactions from these vitamins.( RejuvenAge 40+ Multi)"

7225,"Cotton Balls, Non-Sterile, Medium, 2000/Bag",0/2,5.0,"I mean, heck, if bunny tails are anywhere near as heavenly as these cotton balls, then I now know why they must breed so fast. Upon delicately opening the plastic bag with precision shears, the smell of freshly minted cotton balls overwhelms the olfaction, producing a rapture seldom witnessed on this mortal coil. The fingertips' first brush with these spheres of heavenly delight quickens the heart rate, producing a fire in the loins and a blush of wicked modesty in the cheeks.Not recommended for those with little self control."

7229,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Sodor Dairy Cars,1/1,3.0,I got these for my son. They are really cute trains but they came not working. I had to change the batteries and they still didn't work properly. When I get a new item I shouldn't have to change the batteries. When we did change the batteries the moo wouldn't go off every-time expected. We return and go a new one that worked fine but did have to change the batteries again.

7231,JW Pet iN Action Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,My two Siberian Husky girls love to play with this toy. If one picks it up to chew on it the other will come by and grab the other end and they growl at each other and play tug of war until one gives up. The product is made very well and looks like it well last a very long time.

7234,"Mary Meyer Flip Flops, Perry Penguin, 12""",0/0,5.0,"This stuffed animal is a good size, but not huge. Floppy, very soft, and cuddly. I gave this to a young family member for Christmas, and it got carried around for the whole rest of the day. I think it was a hit!"

7236,OPI NLW42 Lincoln Park after Dark,0/0,5.0,This is one of OPI's most classic colors for a reason. There is just something so sophisticated and classy about this color. Application was great - a one-coater for me. Beware that it does look very close to being black.
7237,Sun-Dried Goji Berries,0/0,5.0,"These make for a great healthy snack. Super convenient as you can eat right of the bag. There's a lot of berries in the package even though it doesn't look like much. They last me for quite awhile, I usually eat one big handful at one time."
7238,"Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray, 7/16- Fl. Ounce Box",0/0,5.0,"I love this stuff. It works great. The more you spray, the more numb you get, it really works. It does take about 10 minutes for it to really work, so make sure you do it ahead of time. It lasts for quite awhile so you don't really have to worry about it wearing off too fast."
7239,Trustex Flavored Condoms 12 Pack,0/0,5.0,"These are really quite tasty. Makes oral even more fun! They are a bit tight, so if you're large in girth, you might have a bit more pains to roll these suckers on.Favorite flavors - chocolate and mint."

7242,Opium by Yves Saint Laurent for Women - 3.3 oz EDT Spray,0/0,5.0,Why YSL ever stopped producing this fragrance is way beyond me. It is by far my favorite and I have received compliments on it for decades. Not everything &#34;old&#34; should or needs to be discarded.
7243,Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100,0/0,5.0,"It's hard to find toys that hold interest, are well made, teach your kids, and are a fair price, this is all of that. My husband who has some knowledge of electricity has been working with my six yr old son on these projects. He can't believe how easily my son grasps the concepts in this kit. He asks so many questions about other electrical devices around the house, car etc. The instructions are easy to follow and prior electric knowledge is not required. I purchased this smaller package to test it out, and now we will definitely be moving up to another. Great product!"
7244,Schick Schick Quattro For Women Razor,0/0,1.0,"I wish I had a good experience with this razor; I was giving it as much credit as I could, but it simply does not live up to its supposed reputation at all. It barely cuts hair, let alone gives a close shave. True it doesn't cut my skin, but I'd rather that than waste my time with hair that isn't even cut. I thought maybe the default head was faulty or didn't have as sharp of blades, so I replaced it. I had the same result with the new head. I would not recommend this at all. I would just buy a men's razor. If it's good enough for a man's face, it's good enough for my legs and other regions."
7245,Bed Wedge From Your Authorized Core Distributor. We Guarantee Your Satisfaction on Every Core Product!,0/0,4.0,"The wedge pillow met all the expectations that was promised. It helped relieve my GERD almost overnight. The only negative for me was this pillow was a little to long, but it still works great and I use it everyday."

7248,Cloud b Sound Machine Soother,0/1,1.0,"I bought this sleep sheep hoping it would help my special needs grandson. There was no soothing for him or me. When it arrives in the box, you can test the sounds and volume before you actually remove it from the box...which I did and it worked just fine. BUT where the timer is located is covered with plastic and cannot be tested before removing the sheep and sound devise. It is a tight squeeze getting the sound device into the back of the sheep. I'm thinking all is well and I would use it at his nap time. I set the timer for 45 minutes. It stopped in 23 minutes. I tried many times to get this soother to play the ocean sound for 45 minutes. I tried different sounds and volume and it always played for only 23 minutes on the 45 minute setting. That was not going to work for the baby or me. As you might have guessed, I had torn down the box for recycling. I put all the pieces of the box and the sheep and a post it note and shipped it back to Amazon. I give Amazon 5 stars. They issued me a complete refund for the defective sleep sheep. I appreciate Amazon for doing the right thing. Amazon is my place to shop and will continue to be so. Just stay away from the sheep in wolves clothing."
7249,LifeSign QuitKey Smoking Cessation Computer,1/2,1.0,"We bought two of these. One didn't light up correctly and the other worked, but it was so confusing on what was suppose to be going on and when, it was impossible to use."
7250,Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - 1.25 Ounce Tube,0/0,4.0,"Got a sample of this at Sephora. Dawn dishwashing liquid removes oil from skin as well as dishes, so my hands had become very dry and rough. The tips of my fingers were the worse. I could tell a big difference after only one treatment. A little goes a long way. Will buy more when sample runs out. I don't notice any strong smell."
7251,"Plush Sable Ferret 8""",1/1,5.0,This stuffed animal is so soft and cuddly!ut it also is so realistic looking. I like using it for educational purposes. And the kids love it!!
7252,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 50-piece Wooden ABC/123 Blocks Set,0/0,1.0,"These Melissa and Doug blocks were one of the most popular wooden alphabet blocks on amazon, so I purchased them expecting a standard set of alphabet blocks. The problem? The letters and pictures do not match up! For example, one block has the letters O,K,B and the number 2. Its pictures? A pineapple and a cow! What? none of those start with any of the letters on the block. Another example"
7253,Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"We actually use this treat toy for our cats. Our cats are pretty petit. One is 5 lbs and one is 7 lbs, and they have no trouble with the small one. The small is large enough to put a small kibble meal in, so we have used this to give part of our cats breakfast in the morning when we leave for work. We have owned the product for about 2 years, and it has held up really well. We are not feeding any dry kibble at the moment, but still use it for treats, and it is nice that it is so adjustable for different sized kibble/treats. I don't love the rubber smell, and I have to say it has really only faded a little in the time that we have had it, but it wipes clean easily and it's nice that it's not noisy if they start rolling it around on a hard floor surface. I would recommend this for both dogs and cats!"
7254,"Truth by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray",0/0,5.0,"its smells very nice.i think everyone should try it, a good mens cologne..i will order more next time i need a cologne"

7258,Sing Along CD Player,0/0,5.0,The Sing Along CD player was purchased for my 3-year-old grandson. He loves it and the singalong volume is just right not to bother others in the house. Still teaching him about handling of CDs. Unit finctons perfectly so far.
7259,MB9910T Slim Line Reader in Metal Tube with Spring Hinge and Clip,0/0,2.0,Have three pair of these. Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces. All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case. The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart. On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right. Wish I could find something better in this style.
7260,Harrison's Organic Pepper Lifetime Coarse 5 Lbs.,0/0,5.0,"We've been feeding our 20 year old cockatoo Harrisons (at the advise of our avian vet) for 18 years. He likes it. He is healthy, happy and and doesn't look a day over 5. He's eats about half the food and the other half is in his water dish. He always dip his food in the water before eating it. We call the water after a day of dipping Harrison's Soup."
7261,"Jobst Relief therapeutic Knee High Support Stockings, 20-30 mmHg Closed Toe",0/0,5.0,"I work for a factory that requires me to walk 8-15 miles a day picking customer orders. My feet would constantly hurt, my ankles would swell slightly, and my legs would be tired and achy. I got these socks after my mom (who is a nurse) told me they would help with all that. They are absolutely wonderful! No more tired achy legs, no swelling, my feet still hurt a bit but that's to be expected with this job. I will keep buying these socks because 1. they work 2. they hold up very, very, very well and 3. they are just perfect!"
7262,PlasmaCar Red,0/0,4.0,"We were looking for pedal riding toy for our child. However what we found were all too small for her, motorized and very expencive. One of our cousin had those and we knew she liked so we ordered. It was good riding toy, and now she cruising around the house. If you turn the handle 180 degree, you can go backward. That was very neat than idea of turning around somewhere to go back!"
7263,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"I ordered my white diamonds on here for a great price and bottle size is big too, I got it quick and it smells blissful as always. I've been wearing this powerful perfume for years it's my favorite.Thanks Amazon.."

7265,Infiniti by Conair BC173 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Wet Dry Straightening Hot Air Styler,0/0,5.0,This is the second Infinit I've owned in the past 10 years. It's an awesomely quick way to dry out and smooth my hair after shampooing. Perfect for those straight styles - shortens blow drying time considerably.
7266,RangeMaster Molded Rubber Handle Overhead Shoulder Pulley -Metal Door Bracket,0/0,4.0,"I liked this product. It served all my purposes. I love how it feels in my hands too and the way it hooks over the doors. The book was fair. For the price, the book could have been more informative. But I do like the shoulder pulley!"
7267,"Walk Over Wooden Gate (30-44"" W, 18"" H)",0/0,4.0,Bought this gate to keep my teacup chihuahua from going down the stairs. The concept of just being able to step over it is great. It does have a door panel so they pet can pass thru with no trouble. My only con is the adjustable twisting things on the side to expand or contract are some what uncooperative and time consuming to adjust just right. The quality is also a tad flimsy...but all in all great concept and design.
7268,"Fashion Pet Classic Cable Dog Sweater, Red, X-Small",0/0,5.0,This sweater in an xsmall fits my 5 lb chi perfectly. most of his sweaters have a little more room for him but this one is my go to sweater when its cool in the house because my big dog picks him up by the neck of his sweaters and they come off him and so this one while being comfy enough not to hinder his arm movement (some sweaters are too tight by the arm to allow full range of motion so i always check that first to be sure they are comfy) this is fitting him well enough that my dog can pick him up by the neck of this sweater but it wont come off so i dont have to worry that while im asleep the poor little guy is cold. It is medium weight..much thinner than most of his sweaters though.
7269,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,5.0,"My daughters and granddaughter all agree that this is the best disposable diaper around. On boys....no odd angle outside of the diaper accidents....on the girls more comfortable and form fitting! On either one, best coverage and protection. With no blow outs, and the design coloring does not bleed onto their outer clothes as in Huggies! All had sensitive skin, and outside of food acidity caused diaper rash,....there was no diaper rash for my grandchildren nor my great granddaughter!"
7270,Tongue Sweeper Model PRO,0/1,1.0,I've been cleaning my toungue via toothbrush for years. Tried both gentle and rough scraping and it does very little. Doesn't even get close to cleaning off what a toothbrush does
7271,OPIUM For Women By YVES SAINT LAURENT Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,Why YSL ever stopped producing this fragrance is way beyond me. It is by far my favorite and I have received compliments on it for decades. Not everything &#34;old&#34; should or needs to be discarded.
7272,"SweetLeaf Chocolate Liquid Stevia, 2 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased this thinking I could get my kids to drink it instead of their chocolate or strawberry powdered mixes in their milk. I wanted to get away from the sugar and other ingredients in those mixes. They wanted nothing to do with it.So I started using it. I personally did not like it in my coffee, but I use a few drops to offset the bitterness of my apple cider vinegar water I drink every day.After multiple attempts (like, 20 or more) with my kids, they now request different flavors of stevia drops for their water or milk. And we no longer buy the drink mixes. :) Yay!So this has really been a great help with steering the fam away from sugar overload. And it's nice to be able to have to offer to family and visitors who are diabetic. I'm grateful for its availability online since I am far removed from any health food stores."
7273,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,Flea treatment can be so expensive. It was nice to save some money for a change. It came on time as expected.
7274,Jarrow Formulas Curcumin 95,1/2,3.0,"It dsoesn't contain any black pepper or other substance to boost tumeric's effects. I take it only with food with pepper in it, otherwise I feel that I'm not getting any effect. I am currently looking for a product with another substance included to get the full effect."
7275,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,0/0,4.0,Nice that it is cordless and rechargeable! The blue tip in ours snapped and broke while inserting in and it does leak just a tiny bit but as long as used over the sink its good!
7276,Melissa & Doug Puzzle Storage Case Single Wire,0/0,4.0,Really like this puzzle holder. Keeps all our wooden puzzles together and it's easy to take them in and out.
7277,Petego Jet Set Pet Carrier,0/0,5.0,"This carrier is like a good piece of luggage. It is well designed and well-made. I was hoping it had a small storage pocket for a leash or other basic necessities, but the pockets are too small to fit anything."
7278,"Sebamed Moisturing Cream, Sensitive Skin, 2.6-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"This is what I call my first grown up moisturizer. The fact that it is Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic for sensitive skin works perfectly for my acne prone, oily and sensitive skin. I will use this cream only in the winter as my skin is dryer. The smell is something to get used to. The first time I wore this creme, the smell irritated my nose all day. Then after 4 days, I didn't notice it as much. I would definitely recommend this product. A++++ all around. My skin is soft and non greasey and this cream does not break me out at all. Goes well under my BB cream."
7279,Melissa & Doug Farm Maze Wooden Puzzle,0/0,3.0,"Our toddler enjoys the appearance and movable pieces. She tries to pull the pieces off and eventually gets frustrated and loses interest.The puzzle would be more suitable for young children that understand the knobs don't come off! For toddlers it's okay but not something they'll enjoy without getting upset.As with other M&D; products I purchased, they ALL are sticker/paper and NOT painted on the wood. There was flaws and chipped/peeled off areas on the puzzle picture. Our toddler would peel the image off if not supervised!These products NEED to be made in U.S.A not China!"
7280,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,"After reading a few of the circuit designs to my 8-yr-old son, he has had no trouble figuring other circuits out. It's very simple for kids to do on their own, but it's nice to give them some background/understanding of why the circuit is doing what it's doing. My 10-yr-old daughter enjoys playing it too.All the reviews were right! I am so happy with my purchase. I love toys that are fun AND educational too!"
7281,"Creative Nail Solaroil Cuticle Oil, 2.3 Fluid Ounce",0/0,3.0,"I've been using this SolarOil for a couple months now and I really haven't noticed a difference. I've still gotten a few hang nails. I'm going to keep using it though. Nails take a long time to grow, so maybe there's still hope. I do like the smell & the brush applicator."
7282,OXO Good Grips All-Purpose Squeegee,0/0,3.0,All in all I like it. the holder is strong and never falls off in the shower. I think the problem is the blade is made of very soft rubber and its hard to keep a line on the edge of the shower door or wall. all in all i like it though.
7283,"Nylabone Dura Chew Value Pack, Regular",0/0,5.0,Bought for a French Bulldog. He loves chewing on these. Doesn't leave them alone for the first several days and still goes back to them till I trash them. Last for about a 6 to 8 weeks with lots of use. I replace them and he's stoked when I get another out for him.
7284,IRIS Airtight Pet Food Storage Container,0/0,5.0,"Wheels were very easy to put on, took maybe 30 sec. I buy the largest bag of dog food available in my puppy's brand and the whole bag easily fit with enough room for a scoop. Latches securely and manuevers easily on my hardwood floor."
7285,Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,5.0,"This mineral makeup is, by far, THE best on the market. The coverage is exceptional. The first time I came across it was at my hair salon. My young stylist used it, and she was living proof. Her skin and makeup always looked flawless, so I decided to give it a try. Being 'older', I was a bit reluctant, thinking it would make my skin look dry. Not at all. It covered up all my imperfections without having a caked on look. It's like magic. Any pigmentation, freckles, unevenness in tone, all vanish with Youngblood. It works exceptionally well at covering up ACNE so much so that my SON used to ask me to apply it to his face before he went off to school. I once went in to my local spa, walked over to the makeup counter to see if they had any of this type, and they didn't. When the woman at the desk asked if I needed any help, I started to explain that I was looking for a certain type of mineral makeup that they didn't have, and how much I thought it was the best on the market, without giving her the brand name.She then said 'is it youngblood?&#34;.. I thought i'd die! I immediately responded by saying a big YES! She said, &#34;I know, but we don't sell it here&#34;. I looked everywhere in my area, and couldn't find...so I tried Amazon, and sure enough, they have it!!!!!"
7286,Penn Plax Baby Hide-Out Breading Grass for Aquarium,0/0,5.0,"Thank goodness Amazon offers Prime Accounts! These arrived within hours before my first mama guppy delivered and the babies are snug and safe in these little hide-aways! I fear they would not have lived at all without these as I had no good hiding spots small enough to keep the adult fishes out.They work, excellent all around."
7287,Nature's Way Echinacea Root Complex,0/0,3.0,I would not have bought this if I knew I had to take so many capsules. Look around for stronger stuff.
7288,Miracles Of Jesus Pre-cut,0/0,5.0,We like the quality and educational value of Little Folks visuals felt cut-outs. It's a great tool for teaching. I like that is also comes with a story sheet.
7289,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,Item was just what I expected and works great! I love it and everyone who has used mine has loved it.
7290,Sircuit Skin X-Trap 4 oz.,0/0,1.0,"I was so in love with this product, until they changed the formula. It use to work great on my sensitive skin. This new formula has left my skin red/irritated and the smell is horrible. I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. The thought of have to find another facial cleanser is daunting. &#60;Sigh&#62;"
7291,Fish Colors Mix N Match Peg Puzzle,0/0,5.0,"Love it! Such a good item to help my toddler, who loves puzzles, learn colors. I would definitely recommend any mom of a toddler to get it!"
7292,Melissa & Doug Queen Puppet,0/0,4.0,"My kiddos LOVE these puppets, but were not thrilled that the queen puppet is almost exactly like the king puppet. It isn't clear that this is a female.Otherwise, the quality of the puppet is excellent, and we have a ball pretending with them. This was the second year the kids asked for more puppets. They are 3, 7 and 9. They pull them out several times a month, and that is saying something when the puppets compete with the ipad, etc."
7293,Halston 1-12 Cologne by Halston for men Colognes,0/0,4.0,"When I received this cologne I was shocked that the bottle had no labeling on it at all. I thought it must be a knock off trying to pass for Halston. I used to wear this cologne sometimes when I was younger and going out to the clubs, and I don't remember it being an unlabeled bottle. However, I recognized the scent when I put it on, plus all the photos of it on Amazon that show the bottle have no labeling on them either. Personally I feel that it suits a more mature gentleman and, looking back I remember the store clerk at Macy's saying that the first time I bought it."
7294,Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Counter Top Spray 16 fl oz (473 ml),0/0,5.0,This spray cleaner smells wonderful and it does an amazing job cleaning stove and counter tops. It really cuts grease!
7295,New Chapter Zyflamend Liquid,0/0,5.0,This is a marvel if you don't mind the bitterness. I eat this with a banana or Kefir as I cannot swallow pills. It does take a month to get into your system.
7296,Angelina Ballerina Mini Doll,1/1,1.0,"This is horrible. It is MAYBE two inches tall and came without packaging and inside a plastic grocery bag, covered in dust. What a waste of money and a horrid seller with no return policy. Just gross. This is the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon. Could not be more disappointed."
7297,"Hamilton Beach 70670 Chef Prep 525-Watt Food Processor, Black",0/0,5.0,"A recipe website suggested this model as an inexpensive model that would grind meat. Hamburger in the grocery store is now coarsely ground, but I like the fine texture of Swedish meatballs. First I ground bread into crumbs for my recipe, then added the eggs, liquids and seasonings, then pulsed a few seconds to mix. Lastly I dropped in the pound of hamburger and pulsed a few seconds for a nice fine texture for meatballs and meatloaf. It worked beautifully. It also did a great job mincing onion, slicing celery and grating cheese. That's all I've tried so far, but it's worth the price for that. Another rater said the middle stem broke and it could not be replaced. One might be tempted to grab the machine by that stem to move the machine, since it is very lightweight. Being forewarned, I never grab the machine by the stem."
7298,Spry Chewing Gum 100 ea,0/0,3.0,Fine for a Xyitol gum. Flavor doesn't last very long which seems to be common to the Xyitol Sweetened gums.
7299,Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light,0/0,1.0,"I've used several bedroom humidifiers, and this is my least favorite. This unit was more difficult to clean than others I have used, and it had to be cleaned more often. I also felt that this unit was less convenient to fill up than other designs I have used. I understand why a pinch of salt is needed to operate this device, but I have never used any other humidifiers which required me to add salt. When it was full it never lasted more than about 10 hours, even though the description says 18-24 hour operation. This unit felt very cheaply made compared to other units I have used and stopped working after 2 months. There are much better options out there, choose something else."

7308,Cabin Kennel Pet Carrier #060 - Tan,0/0,5.0,"After much searching online for suitable in-flight, hard-plastic carriers for my two rabbits for an international flight, I finally came across this one. It perfectly matches United Airlines travel requirements for ON-BOARD travel (as stated on their website, ""The maximum dimensions for hard-sided kennels are 17.5 inches long x 12 inches wide x 7.5 inches high (44 cm x 30 cm x 19 cm)."")I ordered two (one carrier for each rabbit) and they arrived within ~3 days. The actual brand I received is ""Aspenpet"" cabin kennel for pets up to 10 lbs. It also came with a 5-year warrantee sheet, which is nice. These carriers are each roomy enough for my two rabbits (one is 5 lb. mini rex/lionhead, the other is a 4 lb. lionhead). These are medium sized/small-sized rabbit breeds.It comes with a thin but flexible cardboard sheet/board inside, which measures 15 inches long by 10 inches wide. This is important for me because I want to buy appropriate absorbent liners so if my rabbit pees/poops on the long flight, the smell/liquid would be absorbed and keep them clean. I am still looking for appropriate liners. The hinges are metal reinforced with plastic, and look very durable.You slide the dark charcoal handles inwards in order to OPEN the carrier. Press down the top of the carrier if it's getting stuck; this helps the handles to slide smoothly outward or inward.I also like that there is a small opening on the metal part (top of carrier) that slides in and out, so you can have access to give your pet food (i.e. pellets or greens) or pet your animal to soothe/calm it. This opening measures ~4 inches by ~4.5 inches. This is convenient.Now, my quest to find an appropriate attacheable water cup and food cup...!I plan to update my review after I put my rabbits in and take them on the international flight."

7313,Tire Biter Paw Track Dog Toy in Black,0/0,5.0,"With my last girl, this was one of the few toys that lasted through her puppyhood. It looks like it will be the same story with my new boy. He loves the feel of it on his teeth and it is one of the few toys I allow him to keep in his crate overnight. To me, this is a must-have for any chewing/teething puppy! While it isn't overly exciting for him as he can't really get it to roll or move on his own, for straight up chewers this is hard to beat because of the different textures."
7314,"American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo for Normal to Dry Hair & Scalp Hair Shampoos, Package May Vary",0/0,4.0,"The shampoo works great as an everyday shampoo. Without this shampoo, my hair is rather dry and brittle without the shampoo."

7318,"Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula, Cream Soap Bar with Vitamin E, 3.5 oz - 1 ea",0/0,3.0,"I found this soap pleasant but probably not worth the price. It does have a &#34;slimy&#34; texture, but I actually found it felt good. The odor is very similar to bitter chocolate--not unpleasant, but it may not be your cup of tea, and it tends to become unpleasant in areas of the body where sweat accumulates."

This formula, with aloe and green tea, is perfect for my sensitive skin, as is the lower BP %. Leaves my skin soft and clean.This cleanser may not get rid of acne completely, but for me, it's a great product for all around skin health and softness. And as far as I can tell, it's the only one like it without a prescription."
7325,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"We use Subscribe and Save to purchase our baby's diapers. What a great service!

7326,Youngblood Loose Mineral Foundation,0/0,5.0,"This mineral makeup is, by far, THE best on the market. The coverage is exceptional. The first time I came across it was at my hair salon. My young stylist used it, and she was living proof. Her skin and makeup always looked flawless, so I decided to give it a try. Being 'older', I was a bit reluctant, thinking it would make my skin look dry. Not at all. It covered up all my imperfections without having a caked on look. It's like magic. Any pigmentation, freckles, unevenness in tone, all vanish with Youngblood. It works exceptionally well at covering up ACNE so much so that my SON used to ask me to apply it to his face before he went off to school. I once went in to my local spa, walked over to the makeup counter to see if they had any of this type, and they didn't. When the woman at the desk asked if I needed any help, I started to explain that I was looking for a certain type of mineral makeup that they didn't have, and how much I thought it was the best on the market, without giving her the brand name.She then said 'is it youngblood?&#34;.. I thought i'd die! I immediately responded by saying a big YES! She said, &#34;I know, but we don't sell it here&#34;. I looked everywhere in my area, and couldn't find...so I tried Amazon, and sure enough, they have it!!!!!"

7328,"Blue Lizard Australian Suncreen, Face SPF 30+, 5-Ounce",3/3,1.0,"The product image is misleading because it shows two bottles. Because of this, I purchased this item when otherwise I would have purchased a different item. Only one bottle arrived in the mail."
7329,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Montauk The End,0/0,5.0,"This basically gives a &#34;your nails, but better&#34; look - it is a sheer and ladylike pink. Good for everyday or work wear as well as for more formal occasions. Easy to apply, goes on smooth, dries pretty quickly, and reflects the light beautifully. Recommended."
7330,"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Black",0/0,5.0,I have always used these Kongs for my dogs large and small. The extra large I used for my pit bull and it lasted a good while before she tore it up. I bought this one for my German Shepherd and it has outlasted her and my Lab is now happily chewing it. I love the way you can throw it and it bounces like crazy. The dog loves that too. Also you can put treats or peanut butter inside it for a great long lasting treat. This is a great item and I recommend it to everyone.

7336,The Original Anxiety Wrap,0/0,3.0,"My spaniel, &#34;Lil'Richard&#34; is a beautiful, wonderful companion, but he is terrified of storms, visitors, or anything that he can't identify with. This wrap has gotten him through a few storms that made me shake. I do wish that it had a thicker, more sturdy material over the elastic wrap. Our golden lab thinks that it is something that he should be able to drag Lil'R around with, and has managed to rip a few holes into it. I find it still serves is purpose, but I don't know if I would buy another, until they find a way to devise &#34;stronger&#34;!"
7337,"Now Foods, ADAM Superior Men's Multiple Vitamin",0/0,5.0,NOW Foods really has their stuff together. Vitamins should be derived from proper sources in order to have the best absorption. NOW does an excellent job at following the scientific literature for the optimal amounts of nutrients. Always remember to take a 'holiday' from your supps every couple of months.
7338,Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Wet/Dry Straightening Iron,0/0,4.0,"While this flat iron does dry your hair while straightening, it works better on damp or slightly dried hair, as opposed to wet hair. When used just out of the shower it took longer to dry, required more applications and made my hair more straw-like, then when I waited to use it on drier hair. I love that there are tempurature settings and the large paddles cut down on flattening time for thick hair."
7339,iCellTech Size 312 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,5.0,This is a the best price so far that I have found for these batteries. They have an auto order function that saves you money.
7340,LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,0/0,4.0,"I gave this four stars because my son really likes it. He is 10 months old and loves to stand up, walking along the perimiter, pressing different keys and turning the book page. He likes to press the keys, and when the ABC song plays he dances.We ordered this and it came and would not play. The lights came on for a second, then fizzled out and made a weird buzzing noise. Returning to Amazon was very easy. We simply printed out a return label, put it back in the box it came in, and took it to our local UPS store. No hassle returns, very true...I appreciate Amazon for this!This product doesn't really seem worth the price to me. It is kind of short, and it doesn't adjust, there is only one height. The legs also seem kind of flimsy. It slips on hardwood floors, and sometimes even on the carpet if my son pushes into it just right. It is smaller than I expected. I wish the legs were sturdier and maybe had some grips on the bottom of the feet or something.My son really does love this though...but for the price I was expecting it to be a little sturdier."
7341,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TMNT Action Figure Splinter,0/0,3.0,"I bought this for my nephew who wanted the entire collection. it cost me 50 and i think its overated, its very small, its only like 4 inches tall."

7343,Uncle Milton Moon In My Room,0/0,5.0,"What fun! Seemingly great quality, lights up bright, but not so bright it can't be used as a nightlight. My daughter (10) likes the auto setting, which phases through all the moon's phases as you fall asleep, then turns off automatically after 30 min. Great buy! Lots of fun."
7344,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,"My 80 pound Lab/Border collie spends a lot of time on our screened-in porch. I wanted her to have a bed out there so that she wouldn't have to lay on the hard floor (she's 12 years old), and needed to find one that wouldn't be ruined by the elements. All of the outdoor beds I found were quite expensive, until I came across this one. My dog isn't allowed on the furniture, so it took me a couple of days (and a lot of treats) to convince her that she could actually get up on it, but ever since then she has absolutely loved it. My 2-year-old cat loves it, too, and there is room for both of them to sleep on it at the same time. The bed is super easy to clean. I've had it for about 6 months now, and it's been out on the porch in blazing heat, freezing cold, and pouring rain, and it still looks as good as it did the day I bought it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good outdoor pet bed."

7347,Joico K Pak Deep Penetrating Reconstructor (select option/size),0/0,1.0,"I'm not sure if this was a scam or what, but I do not think the actual product was in the container I got. It smelled awful, it was runny, and had an odd color. I've used Joico products before. Maybe this was expired or maybe I got taken, but after one use I threw the rest of it away, Lord only knows what was in there that I was putting on my hair! NOT at all pleased, a huge waste of money! Buy these products at a licensed retailer, not on here!"

7356,Erector Motorized Racing Car & More - 643 pc Metal Construction Set,0/0,5.0,My nine year old son received this for Christmas and is having fun building one of the models. I could sense the frustration he was having so I helped him out a little. I also became frustrated and realized I had to re-adjust my attitude because even putting the battery case together is a challenge!Then I realized that's the point - this is delicate work and much more advanced then the hardest Lego models. You have to use your brain and be patient to build this - great life lessons and a really good toy.
7357,"Hostess Cup Cakes, 12.6 oz",0/0,5.0,Too bad these are gone now. I received them fast and they were obviously fresh. The vendor didn't charge too much of a premium considering the announcement of the closing of Hostess had already been made.
7358,Playmobil Security Check Point,58/59,3.0,"Generally, this is a good product for teaching children to obey people who say you should obey them, which of course is how to be a good citizen and everybody knows it.Unfortunately, the plastic is a lower grade than it should be. When my daughter was unable to make one of the terrorist passengers confess and applied a heated piece of coat hanger wire to the terrorist traveler's face, instead of divulging the lies he was withholding, his face melted. Very disappointing given the strength of other plastics on the market. If we are going to use this as a teaching tool, we need to think in terms of the future here.We also quickly became aware that the nice security agents needs to give out audible voice commands to help children learn the cues for future submissive behavior. For example, when the TSA agent gropes the old lady in the extended pack, he should shout, ""Either you do it, or I will have you arrested! Do you want to fly to see your children or spend tonight in a cold cement jail cell?!!""There were other areas lacking realism, but that one seems an easy fix for later upgrades now that batteries have gotten smaller and speaking dolls are common.I'd also have preferred not to pay so much extra just to get the working handcuffs and the holding cell for the traveling terrorists our children help apprehend to make the collective better."
7359,Digestive Advantage - Daily Probiotic,0/0,5.0,Recommended by our doctor to take some sort of probiotic... works much better than those nasty yogurts and is in a convenient pill form. Tied several other brands but this one seems to be the best.

7365,Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer,0/0,5.0,"OK I admit it is a wee bit smaller than I thought it would be but either my old tweezers really sucked or else this one is a high performance one. I love how precisely it grabs hair and pulls it out, and leaves nothing behind. I used it for eyebrows and above lips and love the performance. I am so glad I decided to throw away the old tweezers. Great performance, thank you Tweezerman! So far, you got a customer for life!!"
7366,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 24-Piece Princess Elise Magnetic Dress-Up Set,0/0,5.0,"I love the way these are made. They are sturdy--like a board book, and little ones cannot tear them. The only problem is the usual with sets of toys--pieces get lost--but that's nothing new!"
7367,Beautyblender and Blendercleanser Combo,0/0,5.0,"I had avoided liquid foundation as an adult because of horrible memories from high school of looking spackled instead of dewy. But after a makeup consultation at Sephora, I ended up purchasing Make Up Forever water-based foundation, which matches my skin perfectly and goes on extremely light (it also smells faintly of rosewater, making it extra lovely!).Next I needed a makeup sponge, and was loathe to buy those little white round or square ones -- I hate the way they become so discolored from use and everything about them just feels &#34;not fresh&#34; to me. When I saw these, with their nice egg shape and hot pink color, I thought I'd give them a shot, and they are wonderful.The cleanser is amazing, and gets the foundation right out, so the sponge stays a nice bright pink and never feels dirty. And the sponges themselves are fantastic. I use one wet for overall coverage, and then use the dry one to dab a bit extra under my eyes or anywhere else that needs a bit more attention. The end result is great. They're totally worth the money, and the little plastic container they come in makes it easy to pack for travel as well."
7368,Nature's Way Krill Oil 500mg,0/0,4.0,"As far as I can tell, these are pretty good krill oil supplements. Krill oil can be a good way to get omega 3s without risking exposure to the trace amounts of mercury found in fish higher up the food chain (cod, tuna, etc.). Another added benefit to this particular brand is near-complete avoidance of the infamous ""fish burps"" that are all too common side effects of fish oil-based pills.The only drawback -- and it's a fairly significant one -- is the smell of these supplements. They reek, and they'll leave a foul stench on your hands. It's bad enough that you'll want to wash them after handling the pills (Fortunately, this smell doesn't seem to have any effect on your breath!)."
7369,Solvit PupSTEP Plus Pet Stairs,1/1,5.0,"I have a little Chihuahua that jumps off the bed at night. The bed is too high from the ground and she can not jump back up. She is a little princess and will whine and cry until someone wakes up and brings her back in the bed. These stairs were the solution to our problem!!It took some training, but we got her to use them. The stairs are great for medium to small sized dogs. They are plastic and kinda sturdy, but I would not recommend them for any dog over 40lbs. I am afraid the stairs will topple over if a larger sized dogs runs too quickly up them"
7370,English Double Devon Cream - pack of 3,1/1,5.0,Tastes just like it was made this morning! Amazing on everything from crumpets to baked potatoes. It has lasted in the fridge longer than the recommended time. Buy it----you won't be disappointed!
7371,Lionel Trains Polar Express Train Set - O Gauge,0/0,5.0,Ever since I was a little girl I always wanted a train set. I've always loved Lionel Brand train sets. I chose to buy this as a gift to myself after Christmas time. I am so glad that I did! Solidly constructed train set. Very easy to assemble. (my hubby set it up in less than 20 min. Let's out a little train whistle and puffs smoke. Includes adorable little figurines from movie this set is based on and a lovely large jingle bell (also part of Polar Express movie). Adorable little details like toy shadows painted on the windows of the passenger car. All in all I am SO glad that I chose this set. I love everything about it!

7375,LEGO Education DUPLO Brick Set 779027 (144 Pieces),0/0,5.0,"While not fancy like the licensed character packaged Duplos sets, you get more building blocks for an economical price. Our three year old can build castles 'til his heart is content with this box of Duplos!"

7377,L'Oreal Excellence HiColor Red Hot 1.74 oz. Tube,0/0,3.0,"So I had done loads and loads of research on how to get my hair from dark brown to bright red (well, deep red like Ariana Grande) and this product kept popping up everywhere. It had great reviews so I decided to get it, when I realized you can't get it here in Ireland i ordered it. Now I knew a couple of people in reviews were saying that it doesnt really work on dyed brown hair but i thought, why not. My hair is naturally dark brown but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times. When I used this the first time, I can't lie I was disappointed. It made my hair red, but not vibrant enough. It really will only be bright bright if your hair is virgin hair. Nonetheless, it is a great idea and a good product, you just have to make sure its going to work. I have another box here that probably will not be used."
7378,Hermell Products Dual Position Bed Wedge,1/1,2.0,"I don't know why the sides are curved. It makes it tight and hard to read in bed, It's very hard as well. I'm sorry I purchased it. will try to find a box to ship it back."

7383,Sole Softec Response Custom Footbed,0/0,4.0,"Gives great support to my arch. First day my feet were a little sore but they felt great after that. Good cushioning for its size, though not as much as the thicker Ultimate version. They last me about a year before the fabric on top starts to wear out.This is my third pair and I'll probably get more when I need them."

7386,Herbs Etc. Deep Sleep -- 120 Softgels,1/1,4.0,"This product reliably helps me sleep. I have found that it does need to be taken as directed, which involves some forethought. It is relatively expensive, but I've tried nearly everything on the market and this not only makes me sleepy (but not groggy, I could wake up and function in case there was any need to) it does seem to help keep asleep through the night."
7387,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,1.0,Purchased about 6 1/2 months ago and the spring just went out on it so it will not close to hold the hair.

7396,TheraNeem Cream - Original - 2 oz - Cream,3/3,5.0,"I received my Theraneem cream last week and it is now my favorite face cream. It indicates that I can use as often as needed. However, I really only feel the need to reapply around my eyes & lips due to mature skin. I actually like the scent which is not overpowering. :)"

7402,KONG Stuff-A-Ball Dog Toy,0/0,1.0,"I don't like this toy. It's an odd shape, doesn't roll and a weird space for treats. You have to break the treats up to get them to fit then they just fall out! Don't waste your money!"

7405,Fisher-Price Walker-To-Wagon,0/0,4.0,"My 13-month old used it once he learned how to stand up on his own and walk between furniture. He would use this to race around the living room, as it moves VERY fast and cannot be adjusted. He used it on carpet and it seems it would be a lot slippery on any other flooring.He still likes to use the walker feature vs the wagon feature, he'd rather push on it than have to drag it. He is 16 months and will sit for 1-3 minutes playing on the attached toys."
7406,Thera Cane Massager,0/0,5.0,My physical therapist recommended the Thera Cane to me so I can reach the knots that I tend to get in between my shoulder blades and back going up into my neck.

7412,"KONG Puppy Kong Toy, Small, Assorted Pink/Blue",0/0,5.0,I just gave this Kong to my dog several minutes ago and I can already tell that it's money well spent. It hasn't left his mouth since we gave it to him! I put some of the pepperoni Kong paste inside and he thinks its the best thing ever. He is a 17 pound standard Dachshund puppy (Weiner Dog) so this size works great for now but he will soon grow out of it. I will be sure to buy one of these toys when he does! Only complaint is that he likes to squish all of the paste out of the toy and smear it into the carpet. It is worth the mess though if it makes him this happy.
7413,"Bean-zyme Anti-Gas Digestive Aid, 100 Capsules, Food Enzyme Dietary Supplement",0/0,4.0,"What can I say. I take these and I don't f@rt. Am I allowed to day f@rt?Beano works great too, but I think these might be more effective for some reason.Your gas mileage may vary."
7414,Ecco Bella Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil,0/0,5.0,"It's true, it takes longer for this stuff to dry than traditional mascara, but as long as I dont squeeze my eyes tight right after applying, I don't have a problem and I'm happy to have something without a crapload of chemicals."
7415,Slumber Pet Thermal Cat Mat,0/0,3.0,"Our kitty cat couldn't get to use this mat because the gray-and-white cat on the display picture wouldn't get off the damn thing! Seriously though...We bought this mat hoping our kitty would enjoy sleeping on this thermal mat instead of our bed that she loves so much, as she sheds a lot. Our small cat grew up quite timid (definately not abused, that's for sure!) and highly strung. No idea why she turned out that way, just seemed to be a personality trait. Anyway we thought she'd like this but at the time we didn't know it would make scrunchy noises when touched (the mat, not the cat) lol. As soon as our curious kitty got onto the mat to check it out it made the scrunchy noise and she very nearly bolted off it so fast it made her heads spin!Needless to say she wasn't too impressed with it. She prefers quieter mats that don't threaten to attack her with noise when she lays down.After several months we eventually found her sleeping on it quite comfortably by the window in the sunlight which surprised us, but it was quite rare she would use it after that, she just never cottoned to it. Yes....she still prefers the bed. This mat is probably suitable for some cats but not for skittish kitties like ours."

7419,Sally Hansen Lip Inflation Sheer Pink,0/0,5.0,"This Sally Hansen Lip Inflation lip plumper works as expected, looks and feels great on, and smells wonderfully sweet. The effect of the plumper is, of course, temporary. Nothing lasts forever.It works by way of two of its ingredients, Peppermint and Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, which cause increased blood flow to the lips in effect plumping them up. It is also what causes the tingling sensation you get when you first apply the plumper.The Sheer Pink is my favorite. It is just slightly tinted and seems very natural.FYI -DIRECTIONS"

7421,"ChuckIt! Medium Ultra Balls 2.5-Inch, 2-Pack",0/0,5.0,"My Golden Retriever loves these. They're sturdy enough for her to chew but small enough so she can actually carry it in her mouth. The only downside is that they don't squeak (which she loves), but that's an upside for me and my neighbors."

However, Leonardo was sold out just about everywhere.. so where do I turn? Amazon!

7430,"Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Whole Grain Penne Pasta, 12-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Don't be concerned that whole grain means it will have a rough texture or objectionable taste. We all love it. It cooks up great, either al dente (slightly firm) or really soft for the kids. The flavor is mild, meaning that you won't think you are eating a piece of 9-grain bread when you eat it. We love that we can feel this to our kids and know that they are getting all the great health benefits of whole grains, as opposed to refined grains in typical pasta. For our 2-year-old twins, we cut the cooked tubes in half, just to be sure they don't choke on the longer pieces of pasta. Everybody perks up when Daddy says, &#34;How about if we have pasta today?&#34;"
7431,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,4.0,"I was a little worries about this clipper because the price is so low. There were a few ratings on here describing it as cheap and easily breakable, but in my experience I couldn't disagree more.It's made well, has any attachment you'd need, holds a charge for quite a while, easy to brush or blow clean and is just an all around amazing deal.If you're looking for a nice little clipper to keep in your bag and use here and there or even every day for yourself this is a great buy. I would highly recommend not paying more for the others and trying this one out first."
7432,"First Aid Only Outdoor First Aid Kit, Soft Case, 205-Piece Kit",0/0,5.0,The kit had everything I needed for a first aid kit. Good for home or for camping great kit. Going to get another one for the car.
7433,DURACELL C12 PROCELL Professional Alkaline Battery,0/0,5.0,"I ended up buying these batteries instead of the Costco pack of AAA batteries that I usually get. They were a little less expensive and seem to work about the same.What I LOVE about these batteries over others I have purchased is the packaging. They come in very small boxes of 4 batteries each. My occupation requires me to carry a ton of stuff and the small size and convenience of how these are packaged makes it just that much stuff I have to carry. I can grab a 4 pack and throw it in the gear and it barely takes up any room.They came in a regular, long envelope. I was wondering what the envelope could be and had no idea it would be batteries until I opened it! They were packaged that minimally!"
7434,Natural Pickled Sushi Ginger,0/0,4.0,I needed this item to make a new recipe that I will make again and again. It is delicious. I cannot image life without sushi ginger.

He has so much going on it will give your baby at least an hour of fun everytime she picks him up. The lady bug pouch is the greatest treasure find. The squeaker toy is also a cool find they are not expecting.
7436,Malem Ultimate Bedwetting Alarm - Blue 1 Tone w/Vibration,3/4,5.0,My daughter is 9 years old and has always had to use a pull up as she had always wet at night. She is a very deep sleeper and never woke up to go to the bathroom. Within 2 weeks she was waking up dry as it was waking here up! Couple more weeks and she's done! Now sleeps in underwear and has not had an accident. This was important for her self-esteem too. Great product! Highly recommend!
7437,Chuckit! Plush Ball,0/0,5.0,"I bought one from a pet store some time back, and after it got dirty I washed it and it was not the same. But my dog still loved it.It was time to get ride of the old one and when I saw them at this great price I bought two of them. She loves it its her favorite toy."
7438,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,2.0,This took way too long to get. It took weeks to finally arrive by mail. It would have been faster to walk there and get it.
7439,MTL Polishing Cloth Kit,1/1,5.0,"I am a watch collector, and a large portion of my collection consists of watches built from stainless steel. Over the years many of my watches lost their shine and built up dirt so I decided to search for a product that would be great for cleaning and also polishing so I can bring out the beauty of the time pieces again. After doing hours of research and speaking to other watch collectors, majority recommended me this Item. At first I did not expect much due to the low price, however once I cleaned and polished my time pieces using this product, I must say it brought out their true beauty again, removed dirt and even some little scratches around the body of the watches. This product is absolutely incredible and a must have for anyone who is in need to polish items that are crafted from stainless steel. The best aspect of this item has to be how strong the pre moistened polishing cloths are. I cut about two little pieces off one polishing cloth and that was enough for me to polish 15 watches. Since we are provided with twelve 4"" x 6"" cloths, I can estimate that this amount will last me for years, so for the price it is a phenomenal buy. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I highly recommend it to everyone."
7440,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,My beautician told me this iron was like the professional ones they use. As iome types of hair fine shaft like mine was hard to hold a curl. It gets very HOT. So you must test the right heat to use on your hair. It works great and I bought two sizes.I will buy from this company again. The shipping was great and the packaging very protective.
7441,Essie Nail Polish .5 oz.-Silver Bullions,0/0,5.0,"This seller is probably one of the best I've ever bought from. I ordered the nail polish color Sole Mate, and got it in a very timely manner. Also it was wrapped to where it wouldn't break.The color isn't actually what I thought it was be. I thought it would be more of a maroon, but it's more of a purplish plum color. Nonetheless I still love it, and I totally love this buyer. I WILL be buying from them again!!"

7450,Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,0/0,4.0,"Worked as desribed. Used with a Luggage Works Stealth 22&#34; bag and Britax Marathon car seat. I had to tighten the tether strap as much as possible to keep the seat off the floor while walking. Recommended, but only if you use a heavy duty bag. Car seat + my 3 year old = about 40 pounds."

7454,Paws Aboard Polka Dot Doggy Life Jacket,0/0,5.0,I purchased this for our new puppy since we go to RI every weekend and on vacation! She didn't like it at first but got use to it and it really helped her to stay afloat! However after we purchased it we found out if we just we throw her in the water she would just start to swim! However for the price it as a great deal and I would purchase it again. We now only use it when we go out far and we want to make sure that she is safe....
7455,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,The price is great for the amount of pampers you get. However I thought pampers being a great brand and with the price they would be better diapers. I change my daughter as soon as she goes to the bathroom. However at night she seemed to always pee through these. We now buy Walmart store brand and she dont pee through at all.
7456,Earth Mama Angel Baby Angel Baby Shampoo & Body Wash,0/0,5.0,"I ordered a trial kit of the Earth Mama Angel Baby products to try out before I commited to any single bath product.

I bought two for the same price I pay for one similar product at Walmart. Petco has a greater variety of scoopers, but your choice comes at a premium."

After an entire tube of this product, I am happy to report that my wart is completely gone with nearly no trace of it ever being there! I am therefore extremely pleased and am giving this product my highest recommendation."
7462,Brussel's DT8045FF Fringe Flower Bonsai,1/1,5.0,present for my Aunt. She loves it. Well packaged and beautiful. Easy to care for and doing well for someone with a black thumb.
7463,"Emu Gold All Natural Emu Oil Extra Strength Ultra Active, 2 fl oz by ClubNatural",0/0,5.0,Emu Oil is great for arthritis. Used on knees gives relief. I would recommend emu oil for that reason.Give it a try.
7464,SlimStyles,1/1,5.0,"So far, it seems to be working well. After one week of half-serving drinks, I've lost 5 pounds without exercise. It keeps me full all day, and curbs my cravings. I have one snack at about noon, a light dinner at night , and lots of water all day long. Also, it tastes great and mixes well with milk.I just started taking full servings and will be putting in some light exercise at the end of the day. I'll have an update in a week or two."
7465,Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Super-Slick Shave Cream,0/0,5.0,"I recently switched to a Panasonic electric wet/dry razor and this product was recommended. I took a chance on it and I'm glad I did. It's amazing how slick this shave cream makes your skin-and you only need a little bit. I've been able to get very close results to my old Gillette Fusion razor (which I had to replace the cartridge weekly) with using the Panasonic electric razor-no ingrown hairs, no bumps and no burn. I highly recommend this shave cream. It's worth the money-it lasts a long time. You just use about the amount of a size of a quarter-maybe even a little less for great results."
7466,Lanvin Oxygene Eau de Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,Such a clean scent. I get so so many compliments when I wear it. I have bought several to share with others.
7467,Splash! Game,0/0,5.0,My grandaughter is obsessed with dolphins so she just loved this game. I like the fact that different ages can play since she has a younger sister that does not like to be left out. Recommend it.
7468,Firstrax Pet Suites Multi-Use Pet Kennel,0/0,2.0,When they work... it's an awesome pet carrier! I have several and liked them so much that I wanted to get more. All it would take for this company to go from making a terrible product to a GREATone would be for someone to check that they function before shipping them out. I ordered two and could not operate the latches on BOTH of them. Amazon was great and sending them back for replacements was easy. Same problem with the replacements. This time I kept them hoping that the latching system would &#34;break in&#34; over time. Chances are equally good that they will just &#34;break&#34;. I'm very disappointed. My old ones are great!
7469,John Deere - Animal Sounds Hay Ride,0/0,5.0,My baby boy loves this tractor. It stands up to his bashing it around. He also loves the animal sounds.
7470,Jakks Jeopardy TV Game,0/0,5.0,"One of kids in college requested this for Christmas. I had no idea how nice this product was. The family spent hours over the holiday playing this game. A great, inexpensive buy!"
7471,40 Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods,0/0,5.0,I love how easy it is to use the pods. Clean up is quick and easy. Great espresso and cappuccino every time. Highly recommend - especially if you are new to making your own. Delivery was fast with good packaging. Will order again.
7472,"Yardley Oatmeal and Almond Bar Soap, 4.25 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"Smells great, priced right too. Makes your skin smell good for hours. Good for a man at work all day."
7473,Large Zabuton Meditation Mat,0/0,4.0,Very comfortable. It is as good as asdvertised. It is important to consider having a place home for it since it does not store away readily.
7474,"Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",1/1,3.0,I keep two kinds of almond flour on hand
7475,Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics,0/0,5.0,We use these for my daughter's therapy as a means to improve her fine motor skills. It helps to strengthen her fingers and she has fun at the same time.
7476,Power Wheels 12-Volt Quick Charger - 2 PLUG,0/0,1.0,I had ordered this for my son's christmas gift along with new battery. When I got back home from business trip I find all i reved was a 110 volt standard cord and not what was ordered.I have put in to return item and now waiting for response. Depending on how this gets fixed will determine final review.
7477,Munchkin Three Stay Put 3-Pack Suction Bowl,0/0,4.0,"Nice colors, three sizes in the pack, practical design. What's there not to like? I use them every day. Going to get a second set for the travel bag."
7478,Razor Dirt Quad Electric Four-Wheeled Off-Road Vehicle (Red),0/0,4.0,"The razor 4wheeler is a great toy for a 6 or 7 year old. It is very well built and designed for ease of operation. there was a problem with the battery, but razor sent us another battery and now it works great. Our 6 year old grand daughter rides from her house to our house, which is about 300 ft (a football field length). The terain has hills, but presents no problem. She loves it and it was also a surprise to us how well it holds up. I would recommend it to anyone with a child that is in the 50 to 75lb range.....wdn"
7479,California Exotics Compact Waterpro Vibrator,0/0,1.0,"This was very poor quality, and not at all strong. The plastic is cheap, not strong at all. I suppose, as someone else mentioned, if you were *extremely* sensitive it would do, but with only one speed it just does not cut it for me. As well, the batteries did not last very long and are expensive to replace. The top kept popping off and wouldn't stay on which was frustrating. Over all, not worth the price at all as there are many other better quality products for similar prices!"
7480,"MexGrocer Hot Sauce Lovers Gift Pack, 6 items",0/0,5.0,Bought with my brother in mind for christmas as he loves his hot sauces and he does. Very pleased with it!
7481,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control for Cats and Kittens,0/0,5.0,Good price and works great. I alternate using frontline plus and revolution in the summertime for my cats because it seems that the fleas are getting used to the medicines. This tactic was recommended by my vet. Cheaper to order here than at my vet's.
7482,"EVE522FP4 Energizer 9V Alkaline Batteries, 4 per Pack",0/0,5.0,"I bought these here because where I live, it's cheaper by one dollar to buy it online and let them ship it to you. As long as you don't need them right away."
7483,"Sally Hansen Complete Care 4-in-1 Treatment, 0.5 Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,use it as fast last minute coating for nails - dries very(!) fast and stays on as needed for going out

7485,Flaming Ringwraith with Light up Flames,0/0,5.0,A very detailed toy and well worth the price I paid for it! The light up feature is also very cool!
7486,Melissa & Doug Underwater 48-Piece Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,One of Grandsons (age 3 1/2 yrs old) favorite toys this Christmas. He played it over and over again! Would highly recommend this item!
7487,Mercury Free Oral Thermometer,2/2,1.0,"I bought this thermometer at CVS a few weeks ago. When I first used it, I was impressed. Temperature 99degrees. For the 2nd use, I couldn't get the ""mercury"" to go lower than 99degrees of the earlier reading. Still, I tried it again. 101degree temp this time; that's about how I was feeling, so I think it worked okay. Still, I couldn't get the silver stuff to go down! I shook it for about a total of 5 minutes, but no movement. I am used to shaking down a regular mercury thermometer (which my husband recently dropped), so I know I used enough force. We put in ice water for a while, but no movement. I put it in hot water, and it still moved upward, it just won't move down. So, for a one time use, it was fine, but not for long-time use. Perhaps it was just this particular item, but it is going back to the store."
7488,Dabur Amla Hair Oil 300ml,0/0,5.0,Ok now the smell isn't good at all but it does the job so Im very happy with my purchase
7489,Pedifix Visco-Gel Little Toe Sleeves - One Pair,0/0,3.0,They certainly relive the pressure if your little toe is out of line and provide a buffer between the toes.
7490,Swiss Army Altitude By Swiss Army For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces,0/0,5.0,I bought this as a present for someone. He loved it. This really smells good. I liked smelling it on him.
7491,JoJo Designs Lamp Shade,0/0,5.0,I bought this to go with my bee themed nursery set. It was super expensive but I have been using it for quite a while and it is very adorable. I am sure that we will be using it for a long time to come.
7492,"Zoo Med Stainless Steel Feeding Tongs, 10-Inch",0/0,4.0,Fantastic pair of tongs I bought these to use as a planting tool for my aquarium and they get the job done. Feeding reptiles is easier too. If your looking for tongs that make a smaller hole I suggest you buy thinner tip tongs. But if you are looking for cheap and get done I highly recommend these.
7493,Graco LiteRider Stroller,0/0,5.0,"Easy to assemble and open and close. Not as bulky or as heavy as the other full sized strollers on the market. My evenflo car seat fits easily and securely on to the stroller. The basket is spacey which is great for carting around the essentials and more. I love that it has parent and kiddie tray tables. I do wish the kids tray swung off to one side instead of removing it entirely and then having to clip it back. also the seat doesn't recline fully which is no big deal for me. The print is really cute too and matches my nursery theme perfectly, if you're looking for something to travel with this is your best bet!"
7494,Best of Tribond Board Game,0/0,5.0,"Haven't played it yet, but looks like a fun family game...got it for family game night when my kids come to visit."
7495,Shen Min Nu Hair For Men,0/0,2.0,Does not work . I try it and and I got ibecause I am losing hair alot and try this product did not help at all
7496,25 Ultra Pro 9 Pocket Page Protectors Fits 3-Ring Binder for Baseball and Other Sports Cards!,2/2,5.0,"If you're just starting to coupon I recommend getting the 100 pack for twice the money with 4x's the quantity, its a better value and those coupons will overtake 25 sheets pretty quick. I looove these for organizing my coupons. You can see your coupons and bring your binder shopping with you in case of emergency deals. The 25 sheets will fit in a 1inch binder but if you're like me you'll need a thicker size binder to hold more sheets. The plastic is very durable and will hold coupons tight without slipping out.Someone made a comment about 9 pockets on a page makes the pocket size too small have to fold, too tight, and doesnt hold several. I find that statement inaccurate. Some coupons especially printed ones are just so big you will have to fold them no matter how many pockets are on the page. I do have to fold at least half my coupons but I am able to do that with the pertinent information facing out. And it will hold several coupons in a pocket, even folded ones."
7497,North States Superyard Play Yard,0/0,2.0,I got this to keep my child safe while she plays but this thing came missing parts to put together. Nothing a trip to the local homedepot couldn't fix but a bit of a hassle to put together when everything should have been in the box.
7498,LifeSource UB-328 Wrist Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor,0/0,4.0,I like this product and have had no problems with it. I love that it is easy to use and just a push of a button.
7499,Educational Insights Play Money - Bills (3057),0/0,5.0,I was looking for a bulk pack of realistic money and this was it. The paper was decent quality and the print is good. If your kids are into money then this pack is it. Comes with a lot of it!
7500,Aquarium Divider System in Black,0/0,5.0,I have an aggressive fish who was intent on killing my other fish. This works to keep them separated. I can already see the difference in behavior in the other fish. It does change the look of the tank but at least I can enjoy the fish without having to watch the others being bullied. Great price as well.
7501,C and A Scientific My First Lab Ultimate Microscope,0/0,5.0,"I don't know much about microscopes, but my daughter loves it and we've found it easy to use. The slides that were included were very cool and fun to look at. The lighting is good, and I love that it's rechargeable and can be used without the cord. It's fairly heavy and seems to be made of high-quality materials. It was well worth the additional expense for this microscope."
7502,AquaClear Power Filter (UL Listed),0/0,5.0,I got this filter for a 10 gallon tank because I was having trouble keeping it clear with the cheap filter that came as part of an aquarium starter kit. It has worked great and has an attractive design. I can easily wait a month or so to change out the water and it still looks very clear. I have 2 medium sized fancy goldfish in the tank. It is also quieter than other filters I have had in the past. I have had the product for 3 months now and it works as well as when I first got it.
7503,"Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,This is the ONLY mac and cheese that I will eat and for some reason all the stores have stopped selling it. Luckily it is on here and it's great! Best flavor ever.
7504,"KONG Puppy Goodie Bone with Rope Dog Toy, X-Small, Colors May Vary ( Blue/Pink)",0/0,3.0,"My puppy does love fetching and tugging this toy, but the fibers in the rope are just too fine for aggressive chewers with small teeth. The tiny fibers have pulled out in loops that get caught in her mouth during play. This does not feel like a safe or durable you, which is surprising because of the brand."
7505,Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester,0/0,4.0,"Works well, can be a trick to get used to at first. Great product for anybody looking to monitor fitness goals and results."
7506,Rayovac Alkaline Batteries AA Size Reclosable 24-Pack,0/0,1.0,"We live in a vary rural area and in tornado alley, so power outages are frequent, and we require our batteries to be ready for the task when called upon, Today January 2013 while inspecting our batteries noticed we had two unopened packages of Ray-o-vac betteries that had leaked despite the date on the betteries which was Dec 2016. Can't count on them in pinch. Won't be buying this brand anymore."
7507,Quercetti 45-Piece Transparent Marble Run - Marble Run Construction Toy,0/0,1.0,"Seriously, this marble run is dollar store quality. Cheap, light weight plastic... even the slighted nudge knocks the pieces out of place. Some of the pieces just sit on top of one another, rather than ""snap"" together like they should.And unlike the description and the picture on the front of the box, this set does not come with real glass marbles. You get 10 plastic balls that are about half the size of a real marble. They still work of course, but just the fact that they show real marbles being used adds insult to injury.Not to mention, 45 pieces isn't enough to get creative with. I'd recommend spending slightly more money of a better quality version with more pieces."
7508,"""Marineland Penguin 200B/350B/170B/330B Rite-Size C Filter Cartridge 6 pk """,0/0,5.0,We've had our 55 gallon tank for over 15 years. Utilizing these filters in the back filter we only clean the tank twice a year. We change filter media every couple months. Our prior 20-30 gallon tank using only air-stones was always filthy after one month. I don't know how much the difference is attributable to the filter but we are satisfied with it.
7509,"100% Whey, Vanilla 5 lb",0/0,5.0,"i actually bought this over the &#34;un-natural&#34; one. i bought this from GNC initially cuz they have the buy 1 get half off deal. this is even cheaper. plus GNC doesn't always have buy 1 get 1 half price, so it's best getting it from here. i like this.. low calorie + good protein.. love it."
7510,"""The Claw"" Electronic Candy Grabber Machine Arcade Game",0/0,3.0,"My daughter has been dying for one of these. She really enjoyed playing it and it wasn't too hard yet difficult enough to be a challenge. After only a couple days of playing it stopped working, though. We bought new batteries and she hasn't even tried replacing them yet to see if that was the problem (even though we put new batteries in and she didn't play it THAT much). She has already lost interest in it."
7511,Hot Tools Professional Ceramic+Titanium Flat Iron with Gentle Far-Infrared Heat,0/0,4.0,This item works well! Very pleased! I have naturally dry/curly/frizzy hair and it really smooths it out while straightening. I would recommend to anyone!
7512,Amazon.com,0/0,3.0,This product wasn't as great as I had hoped but it did help some with my jet lag. I followed the instructions exactly but I still needed to take an afternoon nap. I might buy it again...it is definitely better than having nothing to help.
7513,RhinoGear 11930 Tire Hugger Wheel Chock - Set of 2,0/0,5.0,These do the trick just fine. Lightweight and sturdy. Just don't back up or drive over them as they cannot withstand that.
7514,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,1/1,5.0,"We got this for our 3 year old Pit Bull rescue. She is very loving but high energy. Our dog is about 50 lbs with a rather large head like most Pits and I wonder if a large may have fit a little better, but this one does the job.What I like about this collar is if you put tension on the lead, the head turns to face you. If your dog will not walk beside you at all I am not sure this is the best product to start with (maybe it is.) Our dog would mostly walk beside us which we accomplished with obedience school and a regular &#34;choke chain.&#34; Now we have switched to the Gentle Leader and she walks right next to us with very little correction.As with many things, it seems trial and error is the best way to figure things out. We use a variety of collars for different circumstances. This one is nice to have on hand to try, and currently it's our go-to collar for this dog.Make sure to look at the directions...I did not at first and used the collar wrong the first couple of times. It's not totally intuitive (oops!) Very easy to use nonetheless. A truly unique collar....thanks!"
7515,Alphabet Blocks,0/0,5.0,Purchased to go along with the Peek a boo block and although some reviewers mentioned they were disappointed that these add on blocks don't work when placed on top of the peek a boo block mine work just fine they play a little jingle which satisfies my 10 month old just fine!
7516,Caution Wear Iron Grip Snugger Fit Condoms,0/1,4.0,"I got it very quick, and unexpected found the package in the mailbox. It is cozy fit, and it will be better off if it can have twisted thread or something on it."
7517,Now Foods Psyllium Husk,0/0,5.0,"I have tried many brands, and this is the best one. The price is unbeatable. Great value. Very convenient to add a little fiber in our diet by just adding a spoonful in a glass of water or in a cup of yogurt. This bag goes a long way. Highly recommend. Other brands usually have added sweeteners or artificial colors/flavors that are totally unnecessary, not to mention unhealthy!. This is 100% pure fiber, the healthiest option."
7518,"GemStones Decorative Aquarium Stones, Blue, 90/bag",0/0,5.0,"I do not have an aquarium, but I mixed these stones with various colored ones, and I have three vases filled with them that sit in a small niche in my living room. Looks great!"
7519,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,0/0,5.0,"Not a lot that you can say about it, but it is a nice quality product, that gives you a good and clean shave, and also lasts a good bit of time"
7520,Natrol DHEA 25mg,1/2,4.0,"I have used this product for at least 10 years.It seems to help my level of energy.And, supports my immune system."
7521,Bontempi - Saxophone,0/0,1.0,"I used to play sax so wanted to get the grand kids started on the concept. Of course, for this price this sax teaches nothing in terms of fingering on a real sax. It is just a series of keys each of which must be held down while they blow into the mouthpiece. That is OK for a small child. My complaint is that if this is made for a small child, why is it so fragile? The ""springs"" that make the keys work are not even springs at all. They are the thinnest of plastic in the mold and are extremely delicate. As soon as one of these thin plastic ""springs"" break, the instrument is now worthless to try to play notes. Just as the kids were learning to play the most basic song, the spring breaks, making the whole thing junk. No, I would not again buy a child's toy that was designed to break within the first week. The only education is for me to know better next time. Optionally, I have found that some of the inexpensive keyboards are surprisingly well made and provide a great introduction to music."
7522,Colora Henna Creme Brown 2 oz.,0/0,1.0,"This didn't do anything for my blondeish-red hair, and it was incredibly messy to use, too. It wasn't so much a cream as a sickly black liquid, and even with a shower cap, it was running down my face the entire time it was on my head. I'm happy it didn't turn my hair green, but there was no noticeable difference once I washed it out. I'll stick with Surya cream next time I want a fake henna convenience product -- or bite the bullet and just mix up my own. Don't waste your time and money."
7523,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,excellent experience with pampers. i always use pampers only to my son since his birth. pampers is a nice product
7524,"Stash Green/White Tea Blends, 18- or 20 Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,3.0,I have not found any jasmine tea bags that compare to the flavor of Jasmine Dragon Pearl. This one was just OK
7525,"Toy Story Pull String Woody 16"" Talking Figure - Disney Exclusive",0/0,5.0,"This toy is awesome. It's much larger than I expected. It's made well, and it talks! I thought that my son was a little old for this, but he's never without it. Woody is even present when he's playing with his Mario Bro. plushes. Nice toy, delivered quickly."
7526,Rusk Deepshine Lustre Shine Enhancing Lusterizer Hair Styling Creams,0/0,5.0,Reduces frizz in dry hair and makes it look shiny and healthy without the feel or appearance of using a hair product.
7527,Aquafresh Aquafresh White Trays For Whitening Teeth,0/0,2.0,I don't like this product because the gel is si gloppy and falls out of the trays while on my teeth. The gel is not very soft and stays glopped together as one piece. It also gave me a blister on the inside of my mouth. I won't buy it again.
7528,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,0/0,5.0,"i gave it a 5 star because it works great, beeter than others tried. the price was good . i always read other peoples reviews before buying and it has worked out great."
7529,Animale By Animale Parfums For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,2.0,Looks like the same cologne I have used for years with same name and company. It was a total different smell and it made me sneeze. I reorderd one called Animale Animale and it is awesome.
7530,Universal Nutrition Animal Test,0/0,5.0,"I'm very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.thanks God bless"
7531,K-Ii Enterprises Pet-Agree Dog Training Aid Ultrasonic,1/1,5.0,"After 1 press, our dog will stop barking imediately and now all we have to do is show it to her."
7532,Simple Solution Spot Spotter Ultraviolet Urine Detector,0/0,5.0,"almost too good. It is kind of frightening all of the stuff you will see with the black light. All of it is not urine but you get to see just how dirty your house is. Kind of depressing but it will show you where you need to clean. The light comes with a guide that tells you what color you should look for for urine, cleaning agents, etc."
7533,"Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Peanut Butter & Molasses Flavor, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I feel good about giving my fur babies treats that don't have all kinds of artificial junk in them when possible. This is a guilt free treat.
7534,GMI PetShield Mesh Travel Barrier,0/0,3.0,"Bought this because the more expensive version was out of stock and I needed a guard in a hurry. It's ok, easy to assemble despite the best efforts of the instruction sheet. Screws are located in exactly the wrong place for my car, as they fit right where the rear headrests are, making them a bit of a b****r to install, but that is vehicle specific. Biggest drawback is that the build quality and solidity are not the best, so there is quite a rattle, and I am very fortunate that my dog is only 50lbs. My old labs would have had this down in a heartbeat. If available and within budget, spring for the more expensive version. A friend of mine has that one, and it is worth the price differential."
7535,Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit,0/0,5.0,On time with no problems. Great starter kit for beginners. Convenient and a great value for the price. Good product
7536,"CaribSea Eco-Complete 20-Pound Planted Aquarium, Black",0/0,5.0,I've just added this Eco Complete Planted Aquarium Substrate straight from the bag to my new aquarium and I'm very satisfied of how it looks. Water is clear and the substrate looks great! But the big test it's about to start
7537,"A-Force Dorsal Night Splint, Small",0/0,5.0,"It does what it is supposed to do! If you wear it all night every night and you wear it properly you will feel the difference the next morning! Over time of wearing it the pain becomes less and less, never going away but noticeably better with each day!"
7538,Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,4.0,It smelled good and lasting power. The price was really good too. I would recommend this product to any other man.
7539,SE AG5 Batteries (Pkg. of 10),0/0,4.0,Its very affordable and I probably be buying and using these from now on.It does last as the original AG5 I used.
7540,Earth Therapeutics Footsie Foot Massager,0/0,4.0,"This really helps when you have arch and heel pain! I gave it 4 stars because the black rubber bands are the first thing to quickly fall off. You don't need them, but blink and you will miss them!"
7541,"Aurora Plush 11"" Special Delivery Blue Stork",0/0,4.0,Used the stork in a shower arrangement and sent it home with the mom-to-be as an extra gift...she loved it.

7544,L'Oreal Serie Expert Vitamino Color Protecting Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"I love this product. Every time I use my hair restoration is not easy to handle. My hair is soft, shiny. It is excellent I recommend 100%"
7545,Four Paws Cotton Web Lead,0/0,4.0,"For my beagle, this leash length works well for letting her explore during walks, but it isn't so long that I can't maintain good control. I considered a 15 foot leash, but am glad I went with the 10 foot length. The construction is solid. I have been using this leash daily for over a month now with no complaint. It gets dragged on the ground and through brambles, and hasn't shown any signs of wear yet. I expect to get over a year of twice daily use out of it. If you have a dog that doesn't have to explore EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE, the leash will last a long time."
7546,Showerhead Self-Pressurizing Shower Fixture SkinCare Shower-Gold Finish With Comfort Control,0/0,2.0,"This showerhead was great at first, then after about 6 months, the pressure suddenly dropped and it doesn't work nearly as well anymore. I've been forced to take baths and I'll have to purchase a new showerhead. My water pressure through my house, and in the shower (out of the tub spout) is still strong and fine. I'm very disappointed in it."
7547,Bissell 2102-B Sweep Up,0/0,5.0,"The Sweep-up is very useful because remove a lot of dust from carpets, without electricity, is more practical than vacuum cleaner."
7548,Mandelay Male Genital Desensitizer - 1 Oz Sku 1558816,0/0,2.0,I did not like it it did not work for me. I only use the suggested amount maybe if i apply more it may work. It just was not what i expected.
7549,Curious George,0/0,5.0,"Item is great, well made and similar enough in appearance to bring back great memories. Worth having. The price was reasonable and shipping time was quick."
7550,"Jacobs Kronung Ground Coffee, Pack of 2- 17.6ounces",0/0,5.0,"THE perfect aroma when the bag is first opened. When I opened a bag yesterday to replenish our coffee container, my wife said from another room &#34;Are you making coffee? That smell is just so good&#34;.We use a Bunn coffee brew but for some reason it does NOT allow the full aroma of the coffee to come out."
7551,"Old Fashioned Black Jack Taffy Candy, Bulk, 16 oz",0/0,5.0,This is a unique and delicious flavor I haven't found in any other candy. I had found it locally once last year; but the store didn't continue to carry it. This sent me searching for more; like the Mint Juleps they were around in the sixties
7552,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",0/0,5.0,"We had an adapter that kinda worked for the Leapster explorer but it always fell out or shut off on its own, many batteries used, I was happy to see when they came out with an adapter specifically for Leapster products."

7556,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/1,5.0,"Pampers has always been the best for our family with no leaks, no diaper rash, and happy babies. But my babies seem to be in size 3 seems for only a short time as they grow very fast. So 222 count was too much for only a few weeks in the size by the time it arrived."
7557,Uncle Milton Radio Control Tarantula,0/0,3.0,"I enjoy using this, I scared a lot of people.It just glows and looks really fake. It sucks at moving in carpet, only good on hard floor.It's okay, and still works."
7558,Go Game with Wood Board,0/0,5.0,"I bought this board in order to teach my children how to play go. I rated this set five stars for two reasons. First, I think go is a great game, and second you get excellent value for the money. I managed to get my set for $10.99.The pieces and board are not the finest materials, but at this price I was not expecting the board made of hyuga kaya wood with clam shell and slate stones. The board is nice looking but a bit small at 11.75"" x 11.75"". It is made of what looks like medium density fiber board with a veneer. The stones are small with 12mm diameter and 3-4mm in thickness. The stones are made out of what looks like matte finished plastic.I highly recommend this set for beginners. The only drawback with the set is that it does not come with containers for the pieces. The set comes with ziplock bags. I replaced these with small clear plastic boxes."
7559,BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original,0/0,5.0,My husband and I are very pleased with our BABYBJORN. This product is easy to use and it is gender neutral so either him or I can use it.

7563,Healthy 'n Fit Egg Protein 100%,0/0,4.0,"People complain about egg protein powder tasting like egg but this doesn't, as least not to me. Its not super sweet or chocolatey but if you mix it with some milk its no problem to drink."
7564,"Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attractant, 20 Ounces",0/0,5.0,I cannot attest to the fact that this product is the real deal or not being a first time cat owner with kitten or if she was just litter trained well before adoption. But i have used this product since since her very first trip home and in just over two weeks she has not gone anywhere else. Good enough for me.

I wanted to go ahead & get another one as the set I have is very old (but still works). I love this duster, especially with the extended handle. It is great for ceiling fans, ceiling molding & corners, baseboards, etc. I wish the duster itself was a bit fuller, but it certainly does the job!! I would recommend this product to my family & friends."

7570,Jeanie Rub Variable Speed Body Massager,1/1,5.0,"This is the same massager our chiropracter uses and that is where we were first introduced to it. Both my husband and I really appreciate the soothing, relaxing massage of the Jeanie Rub. It is a little loud, but that is a small price to pay for the relief achieved. This can be used for the back, shoulders, neck, legs - pretty much anywhere. And it is the first massager I have found to be actually relaxing for the feet (when placed in the foam &#34;holder&#34; - a separate purchase). With the two handles, it is even possible to use it on myself if necessary - for the spots I can reach! We consider this an excellent purchase."
7571,TetraFin Flakes,1/3,1.0,"I've been keeping Fancy Goldfish for close to 40 years and if I've learned anything about these marvelous creatures it's that they need all the room you can provide, massive water changes and wide variety of sinking foods.Here are the ingrediants for TetraFin:Fish meal - You want to see a specific fish named such as salmon meal or white fish meal (as with all pet foods) ""Fish meal"" means the MFG is using whatever is cheapest at market including rancid diseased fish and fish by products.Ground brown rice - The first three ingrediants of ANY pet or fish food should be a specific animal protien - period. Rice is a filler used for weight and volume to the packaging.Torula dried yeast - cheap protien enhancerOat meal - binding agent and fillerShrimp meal - Excellent but is only found in trace amounts in this foodWheat gluten - The number one source for pet food related deaths and recalls in the past 20 years. Works as a binding agent and artifically pumps up crude protien percentageSoybean oil - Few Omega fatty acidsFish oil - Again you want to see a specific fish named like salmon. When a specific animal isn't mentioned it means the manufacturer is buying whatever is cheapest at the time. What is more, this leaves them free to use rancid and diseased fish.Algae meal - Excellent but in very low arounts here.Sorbitol- Artifical sweetner makes food more palatable to fish, can be potentially toxic.Artifical colors including yellow 5, red 3, and blue 2, - Zero nutrional valueethoxyquin. - Ethoxyquin is usually listed as a ""preservtive - however it's a lethal pesticide. The FDA has banned from dog and cat foods. Studies show ethoxyquin is especially lethal to fish. research Google or simply look it up on Wiki-Pedia and follow the links to the research findings.What is more, flake foods should be avoided at all costs. Most Fancy Goldfish especially deep chested fish like Oranda, Ranch and butterflys are all extremly susceptable to bouyancy issues and swim bladder disease. One of the significant causes of this, is the taking in of air. That said your fish are infinatley better off with sinking foods.Much better commercial foods include those by ZooMed, Aqueon, Omega One, New Spectrum and Hikari."

7574,Scott's Cakes Milk Chocolate Pecan Bark in a Decorative Box,0/0,4.0,"This is a good value. The cost was reasonable compared to similar products, and when it arrived, it was exactly as advertised. It came in a nice, well-constructed box that looked like the picture. We bought it for my mother-in-law, who likes chocolate bark, and she was very pleased. (Whew!) The package was a little bit overfilled, so it bulged a bit, but some extra tape took care of that. Overall, I recommend this product."
7575,Phisoderm Phisoderm Baby Tear-Free Wash Cream,0/0,1.0,Seemed old and used. The sticker on the bottle was ripping off and bottle looked dirty. There is no seal on it either. I wont be using it on my baby.
7576,Cricket Technique Barrel Hair Brush,2/2,5.0,This brush is amazing! I use it in conjunction with a T3 hairdryer and it works great to get a perfect blowout. I currently have the 2 incher and I am going to buy 1 inch for bangs and touchups.I have used chi and t3 brushes in the past but none of them work as well. I highly recommend it.

I bought this to use in my homemade cleaning products that call for Castile liquid soap. I like that the ingredients are healthy and safe and the lemon oil makes my laundry soap gel smell lovely! The investment in the gallon size is worth it. You pay so much less per cup, and with the free shipping it's a bargain. Shipping from this vendor is fast. This should supply my cleaning product needs for well over a year. I can't find this in any of the stores in my area."
7581,"Dream Zone- Earth Therapeutics Sleep Mask, 1ct",0/0,5.0,"I purchased mine from Duane Reade. I've owned 2 of these masks...the first one lasted about 3 years, and the 2nd one is still in pretty good shape after almost 4 years. It's very comfortable, and the back strap is long enough to accommodate even bigger heads, without feeling like your head is in a wrench with some of these other sleep masks."
7582,"Aura Cacia Essential Oil, Eucalyptus",0/1,1.0,"Fake product, looks different than picture, homemade label. Do not buy this product. If I read other reviews I will know before I waste my money."

7585,Snoozer Lookout II Pet Car Seat,0/0,4.0,"The seat is good. It was used and there was supposed to be some small markings or damage to the cover. I've not found it. Unfortunately, I have a little terrier that has a great fear of the car. I was hoping this would help her. It has not. I continue working with her in the hopes she will get over her fears and enjoy the car seat and car rides.."
7586,Cara Cara 72 Heating Pad Moist/Dry With Select Heat,0/0,3.0,"I was looking for a heating pad with auto turn off and thought from description that this was a larger heating pad. It is OK, but it takes awhile before it gets up to desired temp and stays there short time before working it's way back down to off."
7587,Jobst Women's UltraSheer Firm Support Knee Highs,0/0,5.0,It looks just like a regular expensive highend hosiery. No &#34;grandma' look at all! I simply loved the color. I defiently recommend this product and the color is absolutely gorgeous.
7588,Come Along Carrier,0/0,4.0,"I didn't expect it to be so huge considering another reviewers post about it being perfect for their cockatiel, but it should get the job done and that's why I got it. I have the same super pet carrier (blue and star shaped windows) but its a small and its as long as my cockatiel so... I suppose this is perfect for my little guy since he'll have turning room without bending his tail."
7589,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/0,5.0,"I must say that this brand of batteries last a very long time. I don't usually have to buy C batteries, unless they are for my son's toys. I would recommend this product."
7590,"Duro-Med Polyfoam Wheelchair Cushion, Poly/Cotton Cover, Navy",0/0,5.0,"When the unit was delivered my wife liked it so much she stole it from me. I had to order another one for myself. They support me very well and I am over 200 lbs. my wife on the other hand weighs about one hundred and two pounds and she loves hers or should I say the one she stole from me.I would like to add one more thing, I have arthritis in both knees, and it is also going up my spine and down my neck. Support and comfort are high on my list of requirements and this unit fits the ticket just fine."
7591,"Floxite 5X Lighted Magnifying Mirror 5"" white",0/0,5.0,"I already had this product and bought another for my partner. She loves it. I do, however, recommend the larger 7&#34; screen rather than the standard 5&#34;."

7593,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,5.0,"This size is for babies 8-14 lbs. Buying in bulk is a great way to save money! The diapers come in three large packs, so they wouldn't be good for gifting seperately."
7594,Dr.Woods Products Almond Castile Soap,1/1,4.0,"I've been experimenting with various homemade cleaning product recipes and liquid castile soap seems to be a staple. I like the famous Dr. Bronner's stuff, but wasn't feeling up to paying for it. Dr. Woods, however, seems to provide as respectable a soap as one could ask for. While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I've had some great results. When using this soap on its own, I've been impressed as well. The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural. I've seen some reviews complaining this doesn't sud well, but I have no complaints there. It rinses completely as well with no surface residue. What causes me to most to recommend this soap is the price. I find this a great buy."
7595,Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist,0/0,5.0,"I bought this (Despite reading the low reviews) and I have to admit, I feel as if I just had a facial without leaving my house or dishing out a lot of money.I first washed my face very well (I use Origin's Checks and Balances) and I pat dried my face. I immediately turned on this device and rolled it over my face (nose/chin/cheek/forehead area) as it was sucking away the black heads. I was watching as each of the white/black heads were there one second and then gone the next. My face felt fresh and naked (in a good way.)I LOVE IT!!! IT WORKS!!"

I woke up with redness under my left eye that itched like there was no tomorrow. Now the right eye is the same. This product is not worth it. I wished I would have never purchased it.

7607,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,I am always looking for the best prices on diapers. I like these overnight diapers - they work for us - we always use one size larger than our daily diapers and that seems to work.

7609,"Get Serious Stain, Odor & Pheromone Extractor - Gallon",0/0,5.0,"Great stuff. Works just like it says. I had old stains that had been cleaned but still had a yellow color to them, it took it right out."
7610,Shave Pro Cordless Shaver,0/0,1.0,"I ordered this product because it advertised that you could use it wet or dry, but now I see why because it couldn't cut hot butter much less give you a shave (lol). I called to return the product, and they gave me a credit for the purchase. I am happy with Amazon, but not with the product."
7611,Designs For Health - Paleobar-DF (Coconut/Almond) - Case of 18,0/0,5.0,"I am on a low to 0 carb diet (Paleo) but I still want a treat now and then. I love these as much as I used to love a Mounds bar. My 11 year old daughter loves them too and I use them for a light snack for her after school. There is, to me, a slight flavor that is the tiniest bit like a vitamin-like flavor that you would not find in a Mounds bar. I am either used to it or it is so subtle that I don't mind it. So despite that bit of odd flavor, I really like them."
7612,RED Classic ViewMaster 3D Viewer and Collector Reel,0/0,3.0,It was very light and kind of awkward... we were expecting it to be more like the older 1960-70's ones...

7617,DermaSeptic Skin Care Kit,0/0,5.0,"This is an INCREDIBLE and almost unbelievable product. You apply the tip to your cold sore, and it ACTUALLY heals the sore quickly. If you use as soon as you feel the &#34;Tingle&#34; of a cold sore, then once or twice for about 5 minutes does the trick. It works. Does exactly what it supposed to do. If you use Colloidal Silver, then you will understand the Anti-Viral qualities of the Silver tip of the DermaSeptic."

I am the proud owner of two bearded collies and they are constantly getting mats and burrs in their coat. This dematting comb was really easy to use and makes dematting a snap.

I always get comments about its smell from clients and they are always favorable! Have used this perfume for about 15 years. Its very difficult to find in high end stores, infact I cant find it so resorted to Amazon. Im really greatful they carry it so I bought as big a bottle as I could afford!! It delivered quicker then they said so I was happy about that, bought it for my Christmas gift to myself!"

7624,Vanderbilt By Gloria Vanderbilt For Women. Sparkling Light Body Mist,0/0,5.0,"My fiancee mentioned that she used to wear Gloria Vanderbilt one day we were talking about perfumes. See, the one she was wearing at the time I didn't like, and we had not talked about that before. So, as a result of the conversation, I went out and get it for her. Well, she is pleased, and I am too. The fragrance is great."
7625,Thera Cane Massager,0/0,4.0,I am a Firefighter. I am always carrying something heavy and my back always hurts. This thing has saved me a lot of pain because now I can work out my own knots. I wish it had another curve so I could get a little more leverage though.
7626,Zippo Slim Black Matte Lighter,0/0,5.0,I love the slim line. Perfect for a lady to carry in her pocket or slip into her purse. I also like the matte black finish as I really like anything that has a tactical look to it...nothing foo foo for this girl.
7627,"Conair 124AR Vagabond Mini Turbo 1600-Watt Dryer, Blue",0/0,4.0,Bought this product for my paint shop. It has held up really well in the work environment. Definitly a good product for the price
7628,"Jarrow Formulas - Citicoline Cdp Choline, 250mg, 60 capsules",34/34,4.0,"I got the Choline to use in conjunction withPicamilon (25 Grams) (0.88 Oz) Bulk Powder. Picamilion is really good for reducing stress and thinking clearly but the general consensus has always been to supplement some choline with it for increased benefits. I started taking this brand of choline shortly after I started on the picamilion. After about a week (it doesn't kick in right away), I could notice things were easier to recall and I had a general feeling of well being that wasn't there previous. I've experimented with a few different supplements of this kind and as far as effectiveness and cost, I'd probably recommend these over most others I've taken."

7631,"Sebamed Hand and Nail, 2.6-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,"Excellent lotion, and truly for sensitive skin. Made my nails nice too, huge plus for a hand cream. It is a lotion, absorbs fast, but nurishes like a cream. Of course it depends how dry the skin is, but for mine works well, and I wash hands often, or I am guilty of not using gloves for some chores. Very pleased with this cream, also the fragrance. I bought it at Costco, normally I got it in Europe, it is German pharmacy staple, and a brand trusted fro decades, happy to see it in the US. I also like Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy, and Neutrogena Hand Cream after too much abuse for the skin, when is too dried out. This info is just in case that if you use those creams too, because of similarities of tastes you may like Sebamed too."
7632,Cranberry Tea by Alvita - 24 Bags,0/0,3.0,Very good herb for the woman's body especially if TTC. Also men can use this product too. But I would not recommend this brand. I really like the Traditional Medicinal brand instead.

It offers the option for english speaking customers. Will not allow you to select that option. If you are not a chinese speaker, that makes this card pretty much worthless. Maybe they should make that clear before one purchases the card."

7639,"Bergan Twinkle Replacement Ball, Colors Vary",0/0,5.0,"Bought 2 twinkle balls and they work perfectly. I have the racing track and figured I needed new/better balls. The twinkle balls were a hit with my cats! Even though the description said colors vary, I received two pink balls. It would have been nice receiving 2 different colored balls, but that doesn't deserve one less star. Overall, very happy with the purchase. Came quickly and in great condition. I would definitely buy from this person again!"

7644,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black",0/0,5.0,This is a great bioelectrical impedence device that is a great weight loss tool. It will be a great asset to my Personal Trainer supplies.
7645,API Phosphate Test Kit,0/0,4.0,"Easy, perhaps the only thing i've noticed is that is not as accurate as I would like. If making two tests simmultaneously, sometimes the results very a little. A little in a test for my aquarium is the difference between having algae nightmares or not. I think this test is only a reference. As other aquarist say, if you have algae, you DO have phosphates. Don't trust the test and use something to low down them."
7646,Pure Instinct,0/0,5.0,"great stuff, works fine, easy to use as explained, and very good for its price, I would recommend it to friends."
7647,"Satin Mask, black",0/0,5.0,For a $5 eye mask I was not expecting much but these met my expectations as they were a nice soft satin with a little cushion. They elastic bands fit nice and snug while I had them on and did not move around. These kept the light out so I am happy with them.
7648,Crystal Body Deodorant Crystal Body Deodorant Stick,1/1,5.0,"To make sure this works 100%, you have to atleast try the following steps:1. Clean your armpit before applying the rock. (Baking Soda paste or soap)2. Run warm/hot water on the rock to get it nice and melted.3. Apply a GREAT amount of the rock onto your armpits. Keep rubbing it onto your pits to make sure that salt shield will protect you the whole day.Usually this process will take about 1-2 minutes on both pits.4. Let your pits air dry if they are still moist.Wala! You are ready for the day!It's better if you keep your arms up once in a while to avoid massive sweating since this is not an anti-perspiration."
7649,Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel,0/0,5.0,I love this facewash. It is very light and refreshing. I only need about a dime size amount at night with my Mia 2. I have used it for about 2 weeks now and have barely made a dent in the bottle. Worth the money!
7650,New Chapter Prostate 5LX,0/0,1.0,"I've used Prostate 5LX for years and always felt it was a very effective healthy product. I'm so disappointed Monsanto has bought New Chapter and I can't trust that a company like Monsanto, with its long history of pollution and toxic products, will uphold the purity and health first standard of New Chapter. I will look elsewhere for my supplements...."

7654,Met-Rx Big 100 Meal Replacement Bars 12 ea,0/0,4.0,"These bars are very tasty (or more-so than you'd expect out of a protein bar!) Except that once you get about halfway through one, the chocolate in it starts to seem too sweet. After awhile the sweet sugary taste of it is a bit overwhelming. Best to pace yourself eating one of these."
7655,Aloe life Skin Gel - 8 oz - Liquid,0/0,5.0,This gel was exactly what I wanted. Aloe without a bunch of chemical crap in it. I use it as a face moisturizer after showering. I hate putting lotion or anything oily on my face but do need a moisturizer and this fits the bill perfectly. A little goes a long way and this stuff does NOT flake unless you use too much or do multiple layers. I know this because I've reapplied every couple hours on a healing area from removing a mole and this is when you experience flaking... not from one layer of covering your face. It really makes my face feel healthy and tight. It dries really fast and the smell that is not great disappears before you know it. I'm anxious to see what becomes of the area where the dermatologist sliced me but it's too soon right now to say. I'll have to report back!
7656,"Nylabone Healthy Edible Bone, Chicken Flavored with Vitamins",0/0,5.0,Thought this would last my 40lb dog but she devoured it. A bit expensive for a treat but she deserves it-on a limited basis.
7657,Barbie Store It All - Pink,0/0,4.0,"MOMMY loves this because I/we can finally store all of the loose Barbie accessories and she can drag it along with her wherever she wants to play with them. I wish it had another layer of storage compartments, but I like the fact that the smaller compartment is deeper so that you can put larger items in there or you can store lots of clothes in it. Considering even buying a 2nd one!"
7658,"Alex Toys Shrinky Dinks Kit, Jewelry",0/0,4.0,"This is a great &#34;low-tech&#34; adventure to share with your kids. It's a great product that is still amazing. It's a stress-free activity for you, too."

7660,"Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Butterscotch, 1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make something called Saroma. It was a product only sold under that name in The Netherlands, as far as I know. As kids, we loved it. It was a special treat, a notch above the fruit-flavored yogurt you got as a dessert on normal nights.I could never find saromapudding in the United States until I realized that, actually, the company that sold Saroma in The Netherlands had the recipe and production process under license from Kraft, which had been selling it in the US as Jell-O instant pudding.And, better yet, Kraft now sells a sugar-free version, sweetened with an artificial sweetener.The stuff is exactly like what my grandma used to serve. And I still love it.Preparation is very simple"
7661,Torres,0/0,5.0,This is one of my favorite games. Good price on Amazon too. It's only four players but once you get the rules down you will be happy with it. Game play is short but once again you have to invest time into learning the rules. You won't be disappointed. This game is for those who like games like Ticket to Ride or Settlers but maybe want something a tad less family oriented and a tad more strategic. This is one of my favorite games and I don't think I've ever won!
7662,Earth Mama Angel Baby Booby Tubes,0/0,1.0,I found the material to be itchy and uncomfortable. The design did not work for me. I bought the similar product from bamboobies and like those much better.
7663,Lotte - Green Gum,0/0,5.0,"I've chewed this brand of gum since the early '90s. The flavor lasts longer than other mint gums and the gum maintains its texture longer. Also, it didn't stick to my fillings. It's my preferred brand."
7664,Nature's Secret Ultimate Fasting Cleanse Kit,0/1,3.0,Well I took this product for two days now and I don't feel to hungry. The craveless pills really work and I only feel hunger when its due for me to take more. I however had not had any bowel movements yet which I thought was strange. The fiber powder is gross and I could only drink it with the naked green smoothie. I did cave and ate something today because I felt like the only way I will go to the bathroom is if I eat something. Plus I started a cold and its not good to fast a cold. The pills were not to big to swallow like other reviews stated. It is annoying taking like 20 pills a day. Price is reasonable when I compaired prices I found one kit for $28 plus free shipping. Over all it takes alot of will power to go without food for a week after years on a SAD diet. I recommend doing a vegan diet and limit calories before starting this cleanse to prepair your body for 5 days without food.

7669,"Parker Spectra 360 Electrode Gel, Clear Tube with Stand-Up Cap",1/1,5.0,"If you order the Digital Acupuncture Physiotherapy Machine, go ahead and order a tube of the electrode gel. The electrodes get dry over a period of time and the machines do not work as effectively. A simple application of the gel puts it back on full-strength status. It is a generous amount of gel for the price."

I drink it in the morning and it helps with digestion. A good cup of hot tea to start any meal helps with digestion and metabolism. Try it you just might like it. It is the best ginger tea I have experienced, and I have tried many of the store brands, but this beats them all."

7698,Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion,0/0,4.0,"I found a sample size of this stuff at Target on a Clearance Endcap. Thought I'd try it. As the title states, I've struggled with dyshidrotic eczema for the last 20 years. This caused my hands to be sensitive and peel, and at worst ache and crack. When it flares up, as it does during dry weather or when I use a allergenic product, small itchy blisters develop and make my skin hurt. During the winter it was especially bad, even though I wear gloves from the first nip of fall. The only solution was a cream that made my hands greasy and smell awful.As soon as I put this on I was hopeful. It soaks in, but does leave a light protective layer on my skin, to protect it from redrying. Some call this greasy, but it's really not, I can open a jar shortly after using it, but there is definitely something protecting my skin. The protection will last through a handwashing, although not much after that. (I don't experience the dryness afterward, even though all traces of the stuff are gone)Needless to say, we have no fewer than five bottles in circulation (at work, next to my bed, on my desk at home, on the kitchen sink and in my car) I've used this as the moisturizer in my paraffin bath, and it's amazing. I'd recommend it for anyone. It works for my daughter's hands that get dry from the school soap, as well as my husband, who uses Skydrol at work all day which wreaks havoc on his hands. I've also used it in spots on eczema on other areas of skin and it soothes it right up.It's a bit thick to use as an allover body lotion for me, but the price compared to what I've used in the past and efficacy for my hands are enough."

7701,Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers,0/0,5.0,"Love these straps for keeping my baby's head in place and to cushion the seatbelt. She also loves to suck or chew on them, which distracts her while she's in the car seat. I've washed these many times and they still look the same."
7702,Thera Cane Massager,0/0,4.0,"This product is interesting to me. Maybe I don't know how to use it very well, but I can't see how this would offer &#34;fixes&#34; to my issues. I frequently have tons of back pain and neck pain. This product feels great kneading my back. I've been using it every day to knead my back for 30-45 minutes. I come away feeling pretty good, but the back pain is still there, just not so irritating. I guess what I'm getting at is this isn't some miracle tool that will fix your aches and pains. I'm going to have to make some lifestyle changes I'm sure, just not really sure where to start. If you have aches, and you don't mind spending a decent portion of your day rubbing your own back, this tool is nice. I find that standing up is the easiest way to get at my shoulder blades. I have tried using it on my neck, but the plastic nubs that you're supposed to use have sharp edges because of the way the cane is made (manufacturing flaw). I would recommend this product."
7703,"Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs Cat Toy, 10-Pack",0/0,5.0,"I saw all the ratings, and as silly and cheesy as these may seem/look... cats go crazy over them and they're a great price. Definitely got more than what we paid out of them already"

I do not want to use artificial chemicals on my skin but I do not feel that there is anything for sale that is any better than purre shea butter. If I run out, I can tell that my face and hands are not as smooth and soft. This is the best price on the internet and is the real thing. Ships fast too."

7708,Thera Cane Massager,0/0,5.0,"I've had a painful knot under my right scapula for almost a month now. It hurt when I sat, hurt when I drove, and kept me from sleeping at night. I went to the chiropractor several times, I took hot baths and had many massages. I even took muscle relaxers and pain pills washed down with wine. I heard about this thing from a therapist in Hawaii, and because he was kind of wacky, I never thought the cane would work. I was wrong! I'm telling you, I unwrapped it, read the first two pages, tried it, and in two minutes the knot released! I mean it! Two minutes. I am a convert. Get this. Do not hesitate. I'm telling you, it is awesome!!!"

7711,"Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup Mix, 9 Oz.,",0/0,5.0,"Here's my personal recipe I've used for the past 14 or so years whenever I make this. I find it's WAY WAY better than following the label.You need:One 9 oz. package Bear Creek Vegetable Beef Soup MixOne 14 - 15 oz can diced tomatoesOne 14 - 15 oz can tomato sauceTwo 8 oz packages fresh sliced triple washed button mushroomsDisregard the instructions on the soup package. :)Open the can of tomatoes and pour them into a strainer. Use a spoon to scrape the strainer to help drain excess liquid off. Canned diced tomatoes come in many different types and seasonings. I recommend just plain Hunts or Del Monte diced tomatoes.Put 8 cups of your favorite spring water in a 4 quart pot. Salt and pepper the water, and add any other of your favorite seasoning (I use hot pepper flakes).Bring the water to a boil, then add the strained tomatoes, tomato sauce (I use Contadina), and both packages of fresh sliced mushrooms. (It will look like it's overloaded with mushrooms, but they will GREATLY reduce in size by the time cooking is done.) Start a kitchen timer for 20 minutes. Cover, wait until boiling starts again, then reduce heat to medium and partially uncover the lid so that you get a constant light rolling boil. Wait for the 20 minutes to expire.Now add the soup mix. Start another 20 minute timer. Stir until boiling starts up again, then again partially uncover until you have a constant light rolling boil, and wait for the second 20 minutes to expire.Turn off the heat, and transfer to an appropriate 10-12 cup heat resistant container.Cover the container and place in the refrigerator. You *can* eat it right away if you want, but after waiting a day, the mushrooms, tomatoes, and all of the ingredients from the soup mix will fully ""plump,"" marinate, and absorb the flavor. You can then reheat it and have the tastiest tomato-mushroom-barley stew ever!This same recipe / procedure also works very well with Bear Creek's Minestrone soup mix."
7712,Tyrosine 500 mg capsules,19/19,5.0,"I started dealing with depression a few years ago after a injury caused me to gain a lot of weight. I usually use exercise as my stress relief but I was not able to exercise for a long time and as a result I lost my identity. Taking L-tyrosine and GABA helped me lift the fog from eyes and got me back on track to recovery. I now am fully recovered and doing what i love to do now. I still take both products - L Dopa is another one that I've tried that I liked but did not keep taking it like the others.Something else that needs to be talked about I think, is expectations. When I was down, I was really down. When I heard about these products i did not have any expectations for them and while perhaps I should have I think it is important not to put too much faith in something external to yourself. This will not completely turn things around for you over night, but what it did for me, over time, was allow me to see things with a new set of eyes and with that new outlook came and a new thought process which eventually developed into a new way of thinking. I would recommend L-Tyrosine and gaba and l dopa to anyone who is feeling down but I wouldn't tell them this is all they need to feel better."

7715,Little Tikes Push and Ride Doll Walker,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my six month old who is already crawling and pulling up! I searched for a while before I settled on this one. It looks smaller than most other push and ride toys. Her legs are still barely too short to touch the floor but I'd say she will grow into it very soon. A word of caution... assembly is not for the weak hearted! It doesn't look like much, but it was a doozie! Here is a link to a video of her riding it:[...]"
7716,Pumpkin Spice - Decaf,0/0,2.0,"The flavoring of this coffee is very ""fake"" - it's ok if you tend to like the artificially-flavored syrups used in coffee, or if you like the typical flavored coffees. It's not for me - I want a subtle real flavor and a strong coffee. This one doesn't do it. Fool's pumpkin spice is a better bet for a decaf pumpkin spice."
7717,Mizani - Hydrafuse Intensive Moisturizing Treatment Conditioner 33.8 Oz,1/1,5.0,"I give myself a protein treatment every six weeks and this was my first time using the Kerafuse along with the Hyrafuse. I have used the Hydrafuse once when I first purchased and it was okay but I heard it works better when combined with Kerafuse so I prepooed overnight, rinsed, shampooed with my aussie moist shampoo and then I applied my mixture(1 part Kerafuse and 2 parts Hydrafuse) for about 45 minutes with my heat cap and then rinsed out. WOW!!!! I can't believe how soft my hair was!! It was so soft and shiny and it looked great! This will definitley be my go to mixture for my protein treatments from now on! This was one of if not the best hair wash day I have ever had!"
7718,"Nfi Consumer Products Blue-emu Emu Oil, Aloe, Super Strength, 4-Ounce Jar",0/0,5.0,"This stuff is great! Calms my firbomyalgia pain and normal joint pain. Works fast, no smell, hasn't stained any clothing. Love it!"
7719,"Pet Gear Auto Carrier & Kennel for cats and dogs up to 15-pounds, Sage",1/1,5.0,"This carrier provides the comfort and safety features that I was looking for in a carrier. The base secured to the car seat is what sold me on this carrier, a feature not seen on the majority of carriers. The carrier itself snaps on and off the base with ease. My cat loves the size because he can stand, stretch and turn around easily. It's also airy, with plenty of small openings providing ventilation and views to the exterior. The handle is cushioned and comfortable. My cat is 13 lbs and is comfortable resting on a sherpa pad which fits perfectly on the bottom. I am very satisfied with this carrier and my cat likes it much better than his previous soft-sided carrier. Also important is that this carrier did not have any bad chemical smells like so many products that are made from plastic in China."
7720,Flea and Tick Shampoo,1/1,4.0,"Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. thanks for the good deal"
7721,Euphoria Perfume For Women by Calvin Klein,0/0,5.0,Not the first time I have bought it for my wife. She has been using it for some time now along with other perfumes but this is the one she loves most. I like the way it smells myself. This makes choosing a gift for her easy for me.
7722,Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser,0/0,5.0,Shipped in one day after ordered! I'm so happy with the shipping quality!! My dog wouldn't finish the food without this !! I definitely continue buying it !!
7723,Ty Beanie Babies Mr. Krabs - Spongebob Squarepants,0/0,5.0,"Soft and funny.Made carefully, with different materials, fabric body and polished belt. Daughter's favourite character from &#34;sponge Bob&#34; and she is happy with it."
7724,2 Whl Lawn & Leaf Cart,0/0,4.0,"This is a very sturdy and well-made cart! You can leave the lid off if you wish. The trash bag is held on by clips, so be careful you don't misplace them. A rim and a bungy cord would have been a better way to attach the bag, but you just have to keep track of where you set down the clips. I really like it!"
7725,Essie Spring '06 Collection,1/1,4.0,"I love Essie products and I love this color. It is a shade darker than I thought, but it works!"
7726,"Barry's Bakery French Twist, Wild Raspberry, 5 Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I was introduced to these by a friend at a get-together. Unable to find them in my supermarket, I turned to Amazon. At one point plus for 2 pieces, this is a tasty treat well worth the money."
7727,Mrs. Meyer's All Purpose Cleaner 32 fl oz (946 ml),0/0,5.0,Use this in the bathroom and love the scent and how well it cleans. I have tried many different cleaners but this works the best without a harsh chemical ordor
7728,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"If you're looking for a great popcorn for home movie night, this is it. Super fast delivery - I'm talking hours not days. I ordered it on Saturday before Christmas and it was at the door on Monday Christmas eve. Outstanding service and taste, just like the movie theater."
7729,Glycolic Facial Cleanser,0/0,5.0,I bought this face wash because it was recommended to me. I was a little skeptical at first but all doubts went away when I used it. It leaves your skin exceptionally clean without drying it out or irritating it. I would recommend this 100%
7730,Wahl Hair Clipper Guide Comb Set (10 pieces),0/0,5.0,"When you use your Wahl alot, the combs do 'stretch' and will begin to fall off - at least they did for me. Replacing the combs is a much less expensive option than buying a new clipper. I do my homework, and this was the best price Anywhere."
7731,Thermalon Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat Cold Neck Wrap For Neck And Shoulder,0/0,2.0,"I ordered this because I wanted another moist heat heating pad, and I have used it a couple of times. Unfortunately, even when heating it to the max recommended time in the microwave it only holds heat for about 10 or 15 minutes at the max. Because I ordered this heating pad to be a secondary one (I use the Bed Buddy as my main heating pad, and it holds heat for about an hour) I'm not going to go through the trouble to return it, but I am disappointed that I paid $18 for something that essentially doesn't work. I'll have to try it as a cold pack and see if that works better.Also, it has a pretty strong, bad smell.I gave it two stars because the ties are nice and the beads didn't pour out like some other reviewers have warned about."
7732,Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker,1/1,3.0,"It's pretty comfortable when tucking under the pillow. It's definitely one pillow speaker. With a little of hearing loss and tinnitus, it's a little too soft for me. I have the volume to the highest setting. My wife can hear a little on max volume. I can only hear real good when I am sleeping on the side. My other ear still rings when I sleep on the side. When I lay straight, I can't hardly hear it. I like the cushion cover as it space out evenly on the pillow and less tendency for other lose pillow speaker running underneath. Cord is long enough to run to the night stand. I am back to use foam ear phone for subliminal music. For a nice sutler music on the background, it's a good purchase. I guess if you have good hearing, this is a good buy. For me with some hearing loss, the speaker is way too soft for me."
7733,Educational Insights Math Whiz,1/1,5.0,Here are the reasons why I like this product for my 9-year-old still struggling with learning times tables:1. It makes a sound so I know she's practicing by herself for her 10 min/day. With flash cards she just stares at them and I have to nag her incessantly. When I hear the beep or cheer I know she's putting in effort.2. I like that it has a calculator to help her with her homework or other simple practical problems at home.3. It is very comfortable and ergonomic.4. My 3-year-old has dropped it several times and it seems very durable.5. It just feels more fun than flash cards.
7734,Melissa & Doug English Bulldog - Plush,0/0,5.0,I got this for my baby nephew who likes to grab dogs ears! This one doesn't get mad at him when he does!
7735,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/1,1.0,"My daughter bought these diapers for her son, my grandson, thinking that they would be better than other diapers because of the Pampers name brand. We BOTH regret this purchase! These diapers definitely do not last all night. I give them no more than 3 hours! Needless to say, we will be sticking to Luvs diapers. Not only are they more affordable, but they are RELIABLE!"
7736,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"One of the best cat toys ever. The first one I bought was stolen by my best friend's cats, so I had to buy another. Now this one is a favorite for my number 3 cat...All four of my dolls love it..but the 2 year old says it's her special toy...All I have to do is to call her name and ask her &#34;Where is your toy..where is it.&#34; and she starts looking all over..even under blankets and pillows on the bed, which is where she loves to play with it the most. Over time however she has managed to tear it in half and I've never found the end peice..I may need a replacement soon, since I have a 5 month old kitten who loves it too."
7737,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,Great color and it goes great with Ahoy!! I have used them together as water marble and the design I get are beautiful!!
7738,What's Yours Like? The Game That Tells It Like It Is.,0/0,5.0,This was a great game for new years eve.... where there were several people / couples that had met for the first time! We got to know a little more about each other in a fun way. Everyone could play and it was fun -- and an easy game to play!
7739,"Casabella Waterstop Premium Rubber Gloves, Large",0/0,5.0,Bought these for hubby. Our water doesn't get very hot in the winter time so hubby boils water. The gloves protects his hands when doing the dishes. Yes we have a dishwasher but he volunteered to be the official dishwasher in the family. :D
7740,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,2.0,This was yet another of many attempts to get my medium-sized dog to stop pulling. He absolutely hated it and refused to go anywhere. It was like an episode of crocodile hunters- he was on the ground spinning and tangling in it to get it off. The part that goes over his muzzle was irritating his skin as well. I went with another no-pull leash-- the one with the hook on the chest and one strap goes under the front legs. That one works WONDERS if you can find it. This one is too difficult to get adjusted to.
7741,The Body Shop Body Butter,0/0,5.0,"I love this body butter, it is the best body product I ever had. After using this body butter, my skin is smooth, smell good."
7742,"forever by Alfred Sung for Women, Eau De Parfum Spray, 4.2-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"ordering was a breeze, but the best part was the price...CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP and FREE shipping. package arrived on time"
7743,"Hask Placenta Instant Hair Repair Treatment For Bleached, Tinted, Damaged Hair (5 fl. oz/ 145 mL)",0/0,1.0,"I tried this product thinking it would repair the little damage I had on my hair from dyeing it and straightening it with a flat iron, but all it did was make my hair heavy and gross feeling. I was better off just using my regular conditioner. Not only did it not work, it smelled terrible. My hair did not feel silky as some have claimed, but made it feel rough and knotty. Perhaps you have to have severely damaged hair for it to work. Do not buy this product!!!"
7744,Essie Spring '06 Collection,1/1,4.0,"I love Essie products and I love this color. It is a shade darker than I thought, but it works!"
7745,Remington WDF4820 Smooth and Silky Hypoallergenic Foil Women's Shaver,0/0,1.0,This razor is terrible! I bought this on an impulse without doing research. Shame on me. It took FOREVER to shave my legs only for it to still leave hairs. I had to switch to a basic razor half way through. This is definitely going back.
7746,Omron HEM 629 Auto Inflate Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,0/0,5.0,Good seller. Fast delivery. Item is as described. Thank you for your business!!!!! Pleasant to do business with. Recommended. A++++++
7747,Avalon Organics Conditioner Awapuhi Mango Moisturizing,0/2,2.0,Saw absolutely no difference using this product. Found out hair loss was due to iron deficency and not any topical issue.
7748,Johnson & Johnson Johnsons Baby Oil Gel With Aloe Vitamin E,1/1,1.0,"I had really high hopes for this product because I have used J&J skincare products my whole life and have used them on all 4 of my children, with great results. HOWEVER, within 60-90 minutes of applying the baby oil gel to my legs, arms and chest, I broke out in a horrible rash in these areas. 48 hours and two showers later, the rash is still there, still itching like crazy. It is beyond annoying. I have never had any kind of allergic reaction to any skin lotion/oil product so this is an unexpected outcome. I'm sure lots of people won't have any problem with this product. That said, I highly recommend patch testing this on a small area before using it all over your body or using it on small children. Also, the product instructions say that using it on wet skin is more effective than on dry skin. Well, my rash is most definitely worse where my skin was wet...probably because it soaked into my skin more deeply. Super."
7749,"Jerdon JP2027N 8-Inch Two-Sided Swivel Wall Mount Mirror with 7x Magnification, 20-Inch Extension, Nickel Finish",0/0,3.0,"I find this mirror very annoying to use. Every time I use the mirror I have to be sure to tighten the screws on the handle. The other day the mirror almost fell-off due to the screws coming loose. Also, the 7X magnification is not the best. I've used other mirrors with much better clarity. However, it is pretty nice looking. Just too bad that it is functionally flawed.-------------------------------Update to previous review"
7750,"Source Naturals Ultra Colloidal Silver Salve, 10 ppm",0/0,4.0,This was recoended by a friend for skin problem and has helped me a lot. I would reccomend this for purchase for dry skin.
7751,Magformers Magnetic Building Construction Set - 14 Piece Basic Set,1/1,5.0,Quality strong magnets which surprisingly kept my 6 almost 7 year old entertained. One caution this was a very basic set with few pieces. We used this set to expand a larger set with wheels. Great for all the builders in your life.
7752,Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,0/0,4.0,"Nice, but not high enough for guest bed. A little complicated to install. I am afraid to take out, so it stored great under mattress."
7753,"Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"Our entire family loves them, but they are not sold in our area grocery stores. Kind of expensive for quantity in box."
7754,Small World Express Egg-Shape Sorter,0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my 2 year old son to go in his play kitchen - i thought the extra educational value of the shapes and colors, also practicing his dexterity would be a great plus. I was also looking for a set with a carton that would be durable and last (plastic not the cardboard kind). With these expectations I am very satisfied with this purchase. The carton is a little plain but cute and should hold up over time, even the little tab that keeps it closed. The egs each have a different shape and color on the inside, they all come apart easily but stay together pretty well too, my son is able to do them all and gets lots of enjoyment from doing it himself, in fact no one but him can touch these eggs! He also has fun taking them out and putting them back in the case.one reviewer said if you put the fat side down it will get really stuck, I've tried it and found it does get tight and does fit better skinny side down but we haven't had a problem of them getting stuck yet. I gave four instead of five stars because the quality could be a little better, but I think it will last many many years. I would recommend this to anyone with a play kitchen and looking for fun food to go in it, or if your looking for the educational value this is a great little toy also."
7755,MRC Model Train Railpower 1300,0/0,1.0,This is the second train controller (different manufactures) I have purchased with the same results. They work for a few days and quit. I can't seam to find one that is not made in China.
7756,Vitamin C Crystals Ascorbic Acid 100% Pure Powder,0/0,5.0,"I've always had problems with vit C and my tummy. this is smooth in my gut and I can feel the beni's. I smoke cigs and smoking rob's the body of vit C, at least i can counter some of the effects and it goes great with sweet tea, if you like tea with lemon flavor, this will be good for you"
7757,"Crave by Calvin Klein for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray",0/0,5.0,"muy serios con el env&iacute;o, todo lleg&oacute; al lugar de destino sin ninguna novedad, recomiendo este art&iacute;culo a todos, muy seria la tienda a la que le hice la compra"
7758,Ware Double Fleece Hang-N-Tent Small Pet Sleeper (Colors May Vary),0/0,5.0,"I was hoping maybe my sugar gliders would navigate from the pouch to the tent, but they love their pouches. They love to hide and eat in the tent. The tent is very spacious and is awesome for the price."
7759,Yu-Be Cream Tube 1.25oz,0/0,5.0,"This really sinks in, holds moisture and relaxes lines. I wouldn't use it for oily skin. Honestly I did get a couple tiny blemishes because it is thick but I almost feel like it's that or deal with dry skin. I just use some spots of blemish cream hoping I will get used to it and if I had to, I would limit it to areas outside tzone which don't tend to break out vs stop using it. You can use it anywhere but I prefer the face. The smell and consistency reminds me of Vicks Vapor rub. I prefer an herbal vs perfume smell to products and it works so it doesn't bother me. Perfect for winter."
7760,Gu GU Energy Gel- 24 Pack,0/0,5.0,I use this while rinding on long bike rides. I prefer the &#34;Just Plain&#34; flavor because it goes down easy and doesn't have a strong aftertaste.I highly recommend it for endurance athletes.
7761,LeapFrog Learn & Groove&#8482; Musical Table,0/0,5.0,"After researching a lot of different infant tables we decided on this one and are not disappointed. I like how stable it is; our 8 month old pulls himself up without it tipping over (common sense prevails; have on a flat non slippery surface and always supervise). The variety of options he has to choose from keeps him entertained longer than most toys. The alphabet says &#34;Z&#34; wrong in English but I'm not counting on the table to teach him his ABC's so not a big deal to us. Overall - sturdy, entertaining, educational."
7762,Elenco SP3B Practical Soldering Project Kit,0/0,3.0,"this kit does a good job of introducing you to basic through-hole electronics components and introducing you to the nuances of soldering.the pamphlet that comes with it states you should have a 15-40 watt soldering iron. I purchased a 30 watt iron and burned the tracks on the first kit I bought. it should really advise you to purchase a 15 watt iron, or better yet -- purchase a temperature controlled soldering station and set the temp to around 350 degrees F, perhaps more for lead free solder.the solder that the kit comes with is lead free and extremely thick (perhaps 1mm) for such small through-hole work. it is much much easier to solder with ~0.3mm gauge solder. I recommend you purchase your solder separately.all in all you're probably better off buying a prototyping board, some thin solder, and a good beginner electronics book. this kit attempts to do a lot of things and is only 'okay' at all of them."
7763,Lamaze Musical Inchworm,0/0,5.0,best thing about it is the music. even my 3 year old wanted to play with it. obviously it was for my 6 month old twins.
7764,MenScience Eye Rescue Formula (.75 oz.),0/0,4.0,Must use it before you go to bed as well as in the morning. It also takes a while for it to have an effect. It does however reduce the puffiness.

7777,Midwest iCrate Double-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,"My 11lb Shih-pooh fits inside nicely. In fact she has room to spare, however, she does not really care for it to much. She has been in a soft sided, canvas type crate but where we work it got very dusty and dirty, so we needed to switch to something a bit easier to clean. She is still getting used to it and I think she'll love it (eventually)!"
7778,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,"best protein out there. syntha 6 is bar far the best quality and best tasting. not chaulky nasty like all the others out there. muscle milk is good, but this is better!"

7785,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,This was my first Zoya nail polish. The formula was good - 2 coats for complete coverage. The halo sparkles were more subtle than I expected and it does require a top coat to keep the glassy-shine. All in all a good polish.

7788,Make Up For Ever Lift Concealer,0/0,5.0,This is the best eye lift/concealer ever made -- and I've got a drawer filled with those that only think they're that good. It conceals and prepares eyes for make up like no other.

If we put the rest back in the box, he will proceed to pour them all out on the floor again.He is having fun with them & that means i'm having fun with them."
7791,Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,0/0,3.0,"I bought this pump before baby was due thinking that it would be enough for occasional use. The product as such is good and works well but its manual so it requires a lot of effort and time to pump even 1 oz of milk.I used it 1-2 times then bought a Medela Pump in style electric pump, it was extremely convenient and didn't take a lot of time."
7792,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,1/1,5.0,This was a purchase for my dad because he has a sjogren sindrome so odontologist recomend this prouct for him it worked perfect and its daily used
7793,Bamboo Back Scratcher Massager Therapeutic Body Massage,2/2,1.0,What's can I say? If you're looking to add splinters to your back and fingers from usage then this may be just the back scraper you're looking for.

7796,Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs,0/0,5.0,"Ok guys the idea of using this is for kids not to be able to remove them and of course that makes us removing them a little difficult. I really like this product, it blends in very well with the light socket. I would definitely recommend this item."

7799,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,4.0,We love this product! Our son is almost 2 and loves to watch the moon and stars when he goes to bed. He asks for it if we don't turn it on. It is also nice that it shuts off automatically.This is the 2nd one we purchase because the batteries melted in the 1st one. Not sure why. This why I give it a 4 and not a 5.
7800,Gemstone Set,0/0,2.0,"Disappointing, even though the picture shows them as aprox. an inch long. Only one or two actually were. However, all other sellers seem to be the same, but at least could tell by the picture."
7801,BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer,0/0,5.0,We have been using this seat for about 1 year now and have bought multiples for convenience and for our vacation home. This potty seat sits firmly on a variety of toilets seats keeping our son from wobbling around or falling when he tries to get off the potty. It has no sharp edges or places for his hands or fingers to get stuck. The center front is molded to have a cup like piece that helps greatly to keep him from peeing all over (since he must pee sitting down until he is tall enough to stand) I do wipe the from cup part down after he uses it but I found any mess to be minimal and definitely easy compared to cleaning out a floor sitting potty seat. We had one of those but retired it because it was so awful to clean!
7802,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,This was my first Zoya nail polish. The formula was good - 2 coats for complete coverage. The halo sparkles were more subtle than I expected and it does require a top coat to keep the glassy-shine. All in all a good polish.
7803,Pero Instant Natural Beverage - 7oz - Powder,0/0,5.0,"I have interstitial cystitis which means I can no longer drink coffee because of the acid. After searching online I found a low acid coffee (Puroast French Roast) which I loved but eventually had to give up also. I tried Kaffree Roma, which is similar to Pero, as a substitute for coffee and was fairly happy with it until a friend bought me some Pero. I didn't think I would like it as much just from looking at the powder. It was a lighter color and just didn't look like it would taste as good but I actually like it better. If you're like me and are looking for a good coffee substitute I found this to be the best choice."
7804,Tidy Cats Scoop 24/7 Performance - 14 lb,0/0,1.0,"The retail product price for this item is $12.95, not $57.00. Is this a package of 4? 6? It's a good product and I use it for my 2 cats, but if anyone buys this ""deal"" for one 14-pound container, they are getting a very raw deal."
7805,Power Wheels 6V Charger,0/0,5.0,"Very nice item, as expected, worked just fine! a pleasure to deal with, i plan on using for future purchases."
7806,Jigsaws Galore Buildings and Interiors Puzzle Game for Windows PC,0/0,5.0,"All the scenes I love, easy to download. A great past time puzzle and beautiful scenes that make you want to be there."
7807,Step2 Four Seasons Playhouse - Pink/Purple,0/0,5.0,Easy to assemble .Instruction sheet easy to read and follow directions Recieved wiyhin the time period promisedShould last for years
7808,Thermoskin Arthritic Glove in Black,0/0,4.0,It feels good when I put it on (in the evening) I sleep with it. Too early to tell something about the hands/finger pain.
7809,Jack Black Double Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20,0/0,5.0,"I was a little put off with the price, but after reading some reviews and hearing good things from friends I gave it a shot. Goes on easy with no greasy feel, and the smell doesn't really bother me. It's barely there, and when you do notice it, it's not bad. Lasts forever as well with the pump, so in my opinion it's worth the price."
7810,Wonderworld Peek-a-boo Ball,0/0,3.0,"I bought this seven months ago for my daughter (and for a playmate's birthday party). It gets five stars for being cute and produced responsibly, two stars because it is so heavy when thrown, and zero stars because it just came apart on my kitchen floor, ejecting one of the little peek-a-boo characters, which is wooden and about the size of a foam earplug. Possible choking hazard, but luckily my baby is not one of those to stick every single thing in her mouth. If yours is, I'd be careful. This should be assembled using something more permanent than wood glue."
7811,Body Back Buddy,0/0,4.0,When my Chirpractor told me to get the Body Back Buddy because it would save me money in Dr. bills I highly doubted him. My problem is tight muscles from overuse keeping them same positon for too long. Wirh thw Body Back Buddy you can get directly to the muscle a and with a little pressure can release that muscle. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Highly recommended.
7812,"Gund Monkey ""Mambo""",0/0,5.0,exceeded my expectations - adorable beyond description. Poseable. Sits on the edge of my desk and watches me at the computer.
7813,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I am crazy about mint and turquoise colors, especially in the spring and summer time and this mint polish is gorgeous! I wouldn't say that I love it any more than any of my other mint polishes, but I do like it quite a bit and would definitely recommend it!"
7814,BRAUN 4775 Tricontrol Shaver for Men,0/0,5.0,"We moved and my husband lost his shaver (somewhere) anyway, I found this one and it was exactly like the one he can not find. He was very pleased"
7815,Euphoria Perfume For Women by Calvin Klein,0/0,5.0,Love this perfume. Beautiful layered scents that last a long time. Quality product....would def buy again. Be careful BC bottle is fragile
7816,Ecco Bella Natural Soft Eyeliner Pencil,0/0,5.0,"I love this mascara, it's super dark, goes on smoothly. i wear contacts and love that it doesn't flake into my eyes. It washes off cleanly too, it's great!"
7817,NARS Cosmetics Lip Gloss,0/0,4.0,"This was my first NARS lipgloss, and definitely my most expensive lipgloss I have purchased to date! This is one of those products that I have heard people rave about over the last few years, and just had to try it for myself! Overall I really like the consistency of this gloss. It is extremely smooth and creamy. It definitely feels like a higher end lipgloss. I don't notice a smell when I use it all (I know a few people who claim these stink horribly.) The color is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars. It is a very light, kind of milky pink color. It just looks different then I had imagined it to look, even though I had viewed swatches of it and seen people wear it in blogs and stuff. I am still experimenting with which lipsticks/lipliners it looks best with to find something I might love it with. Overall, I love the consistency, even though I am not crazy about the color, and will definitely purchase another NARS lipgloss in the future!"
7818,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,I used a coupon 2$ off. good price. I look forward to better offer next time ro so. maybe... df
7819,"Optimum Nutrition Opti-Women, Women's Multivitamin",1/1,5.0,I used to take Multi Vitamins from GNC. I switched to this one. The price is good and it seems to make me feel better. I love this one!
7820,"Aveeno Active Naturals Stress Relief Foaming Bath, 10-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,Aveeno products are quality! I loved this one- the smell is calming and it makes my skin feel very smooth after using it.
7821,"Igourmet Pub Cheese Assortment, 2-Pound",0/0,5.0,"We send these cheeses to family far away. Always happy with the gift, and there is something for everyone in the package."
7822,Africa's Best No-Lye Relaxer System,0/0,5.0,"Great, great, great. I love this relaxer, works very well for my hair . My hair looks shiny, healthy and bouncy."
7823,Kelp (Iodine Source) 225 mcg 250 Tabs - Swanson Premium,0/0,5.0,A few months ago I saw a study that said most American's aren't getting the RDA of iodine needed to prevent deficiencies from iodized salt. This worried me as I barely used salt as it is and didn't want to start getting any thyroid problems from the lack of iodine. I picked this up since it's cheap to prevent it.
7824,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magnetic Calendar,0/0,5.0,very nice product. Very high quality. you get what you pay for and this is well worth it. Thank you!
7825,"Vet's Best Ear Relief Wash & Dry, Two 4oz Bottles",0/0,5.0,Dog has had bad ears for years. Tried all kinds of things. First thing to ever work and quickly at that.
7826,"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",0/0,3.0,"I did use them several times but find myself using them less and less. They are very hard to clean and create a lot of mess. However, design wise, they are very comfortable for a baby. He was able to hold them easily."
7827,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,0/0,5.0,I bought this gift for my daughter. I asked her opinion because I was worried about all the review of the fake Chi's. She told me it was not exactly like her last Chi but got the job done on her hair and was well worth the price and more. I did spend a lot of time studying about the fake Chi's and I did find that the seller Abzoo sells their Chi's to Sears and Sears sells them in their stores. I thought this was good information even though I ordered the product without studying the information ahead of time. I was very worried but after doing my research and listening to my daughter I feel much more confident. I really hope it is the real thing.
7828,Snoozer Console Pet Car Seat Cream Fur,0/0,5.0,The harness is a bit bulky for my tiny little chihuahua. But she likes being up higher so it works good. Very happy with the quality and my dog likes it so I would buy it again.
7829,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,0/0,1.0,"This product is definitely not as easy to use as it seems. I think it probably works great, if I could get it to work for me."
7830,Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet,0/0,5.0,"another great product by M&D.....well made, study & very good magnet strength. our 15 month old grandson loves these & plays with them on his magnet board easel. worth the $$$$."
7831,Natural Calm Natural Vitality,1/1,5.0,My son has a chronic colon condition. After regular laxatives failed to help and after finding out and experiencing the horrific side effects of certain ingredients we took him off all laxatives. We heard about Natural Calm and tried it...it is the only product that has helped him! I have 4 kids and he is the only one who takes this and we have noticed that he is the only one who does not get sick during the winter like everyone else! His immune system has been greatly helped by this product! We are so thankful we found Natural Calm!!
7832,Enzymatic Therapy L-Theanine,20/20,4.0,"Ever since I first purchased this product and started taking it daily, I've felt an overwhelming sense of well-being and a welcomed calmness in my daily activities. I've also noticed that my thinking and decision making seems to be easier and with less effort. I would recommend this product for all of the natural benefits that come from taking it. In my opinion, ordering the powder is MUCH more economical especially for me because the dosage that I found works best for me is around 400mg which would be 4 pills gone per day. But if ease of use is what your looking for than capsules are good too. Either way, if your in need of a natural stress reliever then get L-theanine - it works!"
7833,Youth Dew by Estee Lauder for Women - 2.2 Ounce EDP Spray,0/0,5.0,"Am using this sent since age 22. Love it! I live in Texas, for the last 27 years, so it became my winter scent."
7834,Aquolina Pink Sugar,0/0,5.0,"I get tons of compliments when I wear this perfume, which usually come in the form of &#34;you smell sweet, like vanilla!&#34; Great scent, not overpowering. Love it!"
7835,Cool Water By Davidoff For Men,0/0,5.0,this is my favorite. The price is one that can't be beat.. Product came earlier than expected. Rate the company as excellent.
7836,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,"When my male alpha cat passed away my other two female cats suddenly started getting into awful fights. One of the females is now the pack leader and was not very comfortable with her new position. Feliway has a calming and reassuring effect on my cats. They rarely fight at all anymore, but rather snuggle next to each other. I can highly recommend it."
7837,KONG Teddy Bear Dog Toy,1/1,1.0,"My 19 lb. Boston Terrier loves stuffed toys, but only to pull out the stuffing. So, I usually buy stuffing less toys. I decided to give this toy a try based on reviews about how tough it is. Well an hour later the toy is destroyed.I'll go back to buying stuffing less toys. Don't waste your money like I did."
7838,"Optimum Nutrition Pro Complex, 4.6 Pound",0/0,5.0,I do take this protein for breakfast every morning. It does a good job but it's too sweet for me.
7839,Mega Yohimbe Extract 750 mg 120 Caps,0/1,1.0,"I actually believe this stuff is potent enough to kill someone. My friends please be careful. I basically use 1 capsule and break it down into 5 dosage since it is so damn potent.And believe me it is potent but not in a good way. Increased heart rate, nausea, body ache all that but 10 times worse than you can imagine. You have been warned."
7840,Cerberus,0/0,5.0,This toy is very well made and durable. It has been played with a lot and was a great addition to the collection.
7841,K&H Kitty Sill Deluxe,0/0,5.0,"My cats love perch. It looks very stylish. I was glad i read the review that said i could reverse the cover, because it works mich better for me and my cat with the pillow toward the room, instead of toward the window."
7842,MAJA For Women By MYRURGIA Eau de Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,"I've been using this product since the 60's and I love it. It has a mild spicy smell, not sickly sweet like so many others.Also Amazon has the best price."
7843,Maxell Watch Battery Button Cell LR41 AG3 192 Pack of 10 Batteries,0/0,5.0,"these work as described, same thing you would get from the local store for a fraction of the cost. I now order all my batteries from here."
7844,"Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, White",0/0,5.0,"This hair dryer works as well as any in a salon! The best part is its used in the privacy of your home! It's quiet, fits on any table & the results are amazing!"
7845,Duck Quill Feathers - Bright Color Assortments,0/0,3.0,"I expected 3-5 inch quills, but most of them were 2-3 inch. I use these to help students learn how to fletch arrows without having to break the bank. They are great for teaching the concept but without a larger number of 5 inch quills its hard for them to test how their hard work payed off."
7846,Surya Henna Henna Cream Light Brown,0/0,5.0,I use this dye all the time. I use it only on my temple (gray hair). It lasts about two weeks before I have to reapply.
7847,"Ethical Pet Wide Durable Heavy Gauge Plastic Colorful Springs Cat Toy, 10-Pack",0/0,5.0,Lots of movement for your budding soccer kitty to chase. She'll be bending it like Beckham in no time at all.
7848,NOW Foods Lavender Oil,0/2,5.0,WHAT I DISLIKED IS THAT AMAZON SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT INITIALLY. THEY SENT 4 OUNCES OF EUCALYPTUS OIL INSTEAD. I GOT THE LAVENDER OIL EVENTUALLY.
7849,Nature's Way Mega 3/6/9 Blend 1350mg,0/0,3.0,"I've only taken these 2 days now, but have had serious digestional problems. After a quick Google search, it seems the cause is most likely the Flax Oil, which can cause a laxative effect. I really wanted to be able to use this since my other EFA causes fish burps, but it's not for me. And I only took 1 a day to start. I couldn't imagine the outcome if I had taken 3!"
7850,"100% Whey, Vanilla 5 lb",0/0,5.0,"This was at a great price, has few ingredients, and is near perfect for my Primal Diet! Thanks soo much!"
7851,"K&H Heated Resting Mat for Small Animals, 9 By 12 Inches",0/0,5.0,"I have an aviary, and in it is a bird that is supposed to be ok outdoors all year in the wild...but she doesn't have any other birds to roost with, and I was worried. I bought one of these little heaters and built a custom plywood birdhouse around the heater. I mounted it on the back wall, so Birdy can move closer or farther from it inside the birdhouse. It has been on continuously for about 3 months now. Oh my gosh Birdy loves it! She stays in the birdhouse on cold mornings, with only her beak sticking out the door to sing her morning greetings to the yard birds.THEN...we needed to provide a home for a Guinea pig. So I got another heater, and built a custom guinea pig house around this heater. It is mounted on the floor, and covered by a plastic tray cut from a dish pan to make it easy to clean. Piggy loves his house too, and I installed it on low blocks in the aviary.It is an odd little family group, but warm and happy."
7852,"Aura Cacia Apricot Kernel, Skin Care Oil, 16 Ounce Bottles",0/0,5.0,"Dry skin in the winter sucks! Apricot kernel oil is great! I put this all over after my shower. I don't even bother with a towel - I'm dry by the time this is on. And then I put Curel body lotion on over it. The lotion makes the oil absorb, so you don't get your clothes oily. I used to use olive oil, but I'd start to smell a bit like old oil by the end of the day, and I've been told that can encourage fungal growth (?). This feels better, works better, and no smell. I think it's even the good Omega 3 type fat too. A person with less dry skin could use almond oil, but it's too light for me. When I get REALLY dry skin, I pull out the avocado oil, but for my VERY dry skin, this is great."
7853,Bang Gun with Flag,0/0,5.0,I was very pleased with my purchase of this gun. It looks exactly like the photo and works great with a Harley Quinn costume. I highly recommend buying this item.
7854,Fisher-Price Super Sounds Soccer,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He was so excited to get it that he insisted we put it together right then and there. The directions were a little iffy when it came to putting the net on so I gave up on them and improvised with better results. We didn't have an air pump attachment for the enclosed soccer ball, but he improvised with another one on hand and he played with it for the rest of the evening."

7857,Melissa & Doug Geometric Stacker,0/0,5.0,Not as boring as the simple ring type. It was a bit advanced for my 18 month old son since the squares are notched.
7858,Harmony Kids Deluxe Toy Box,0/0,4.0,Just received and am writing to clarify what I saw in other reviews
7859,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,2/2,1.0,"Just wanted to add another cautionary post here about your baby tipping over. My 7 mo. old was within a second of face planting as she reached for a dropped toy--I luckily looked over and caught the chair right before she smashed into the hardwood floor. It's kind of disappointing since I think of Fisher Price as a gold standard in child product safety, we grew up with Fisher Price products ourselves. Some other people have written here not to use the chair in rocking mode with infants of this age, but this isn't really made obvious, and I naively thought that since the product says 'safe up to 40-lb. toddlers', it was engineered to not tip over. It's not a bad product overall, but this is something that anyone who uses this chair should be aware of."
7860,BioFreeze Pain Relief Gel,0/0,4.0,"Better than icy hot because it doesn't burn your skin, but it needs to be reapplied often if you want to stay pain free. I continue to buy this because it helps with arthritis pain in my neck and sore shoulders from stress. It is not thick and can slip down your finger, but you can get the hang of it if you use it daily like I do. It doesn't have too strong of a scent, though it still smells like menthol."
7861,Interlude Cologne for Women by Frances Denney,0/0,5.0,I was really excited to find this product on line. Have loved this scent for many many years. Loved by men & women
7862,Training Gear Set,0/0,3.0,"In this product's defense, the helicopter I was using was a bit too large; however, the reports I read stated that most of the choppers could not support the weight. The product seems somewhat flimsy; however, for the price, worked well enough if only for a limited amount of time."
7863,"Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel, (19 x 39-Inches)",0/0,5.0,"This towel is far superior to a regular bath towel for wrapping around your head turban-style when you get out of the shower. It is compact, light and absorbent. I will probably pick up a few more."
7864,Carex Universal Bath Bench with Back,0/0,5.0,I weigh 290 and I am non weight bearing on my leg for six months due to major surgery. Had the kind with the metal legs and always felt like I was gonna fall until I did when the leg gave out on me! This is a very comfortable and very very strong chair that fits in the tub and shower! Highly recommend this product for any weight!
7865,ThinkFun River Crossing,0/0,5.0,I took the cards and made life sized replica in the yard. My 3 year old had a blast moving the sections of boards around.
7866,"D.A.P. (Dog Appeasing Pheromone) Collar for Puppies and Small Dogs - 17.7""",0/0,4.0,"I'm sure this works for some dogs, I'm not disappointed in the product itself, but we didn't get a big bang out of it. For a few days my boy seemed a little more giddy :) With nervous dogs, I think you just have to try different things, definitely in combination with behavioral/desensitizing practices."
7867,Royal Copenhagen By Royal Copenhagen For Men. Cologne Spray 3.3 Ounces,0/0,4.0,I've used this cologne for over 20 years now because it's the one my father used. Not only do I love the scent but it is very different than most mainstream colognes now and people really notice it's gentle air. Very good product.
7868,FertileCM,0/0,3.0,I got pregnant after a month of using these... Who knows if it was the pills or just a chance... I probably would not use these again for that reason. did not see any change in mucus
7869,Neilmed Neilmed Sinus Rinse Premixed Packets,0/0,5.0,"The package is rectangle instead of square shape, it is much easier to open without accidentally drop it. After few times of use my nose feels better. It is highly recommended."
7870,Doc Johnson Vac-U-Lock Realistic Cock,0/0,3.0,The vac u lock is a bit of a pain. Only had the harness so don't know how it works on other vac u lock things.
7871,Dr. Singhas Mustard Bath Mustard Rub,0/0,3.0,this mustard's write up is much better than the actual thing. Maybe my pain level is unreachable with just a rub.
7872,OXO Good Grips Household Scrub Brush,0/0,4.0,"I rarely review my purchases. Nor did I ever think a scrub brush would make me so excited, but here I am. Reviewing and excited.The bristles seem sturdy and durable (I've only owned it for a day- will update in a few months). The handle provides a good grip, although I think it might be a bit short for larger hands. I have hands the size of an 8th grader's (I've checked), and it was just right for me.The brush did away with crud on my shower tub that I've been working at for years, as well as mildew and mold on an old shower curtain that I nearly gave up on (don't ask me why we kept it. I don't know). These are both things that I must have invested hours of time and energy on over the last five years with middling results, and with the brush I took care of them in less than half an hour.Color me amazed."
7873,"Hodgson Mill European Cheese & Herb Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,"I have made this bread mix a few times in the past, but I was having a hard time finding it again. The mix is easy to use, but does not make a very large loaf when baked. I baked it on the light setting, and I wished I had used at least medium. This bread is really good hot with a meal, but I do not care for it as much when it is cold."
7874,12-3 inch Soft Rubber Chicken Key Chain - Gag Gift,0/0,4.0,"As a joke, my daughter wanted to get everyone a rubber chicken for Christmas. I come from a very large family and these were perfect for her plan. They arrived intact and seem to have held up to wear- haven't heard back anything negative."
7875,Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs,0/0,5.0,"We got these to put in all of our exposed outlets to keep our toddler from sticking things in them. They work fine, and he hasn't started trying to remove them...yet. They were inexpensive and serve their purpose."
7876,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,This is a neon pink polish that I absolutely love. It is so bright and smooth. And on top of that I got it brand new for only a penny with free shipping (I think somebody messed up really bad on that one). What an AWESOME deal!!!
7877,BABYBJORN Safe Step,0/0,5.0,"Not that we are using it non-stop, but my son likes to use it here and there. Of course I'm by his side, but so far, step seems stable for our use."

7881,BearView Infant Mirror,0/0,5.0,"Great Product!! very useful, good quality, i love it, the price it is ok, and the size two. I will buy it again!!"
7882,Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Love to Play Puppy,0/0,5.0,this learning puppy is the cutest thing for children and even if they are too young to learn from the puppy it is still cuddly enough to be their hugging pal until they can grow into the appropriate use of the play puppy. The colorful dog is appealing to the eye and can definitely become a fun way to learn for young children.
7883,PetSafe Telescoping Aluminum Wall Entry Pet Door,0/0,3.0,The insert was warped on one side and the flaps sticks. I will have to put a screw in it to hold it down.Not hard to install. Make sure to double check the alignment of the cardboard box for the outside mark.
7884,"Yogi Kava Stress Relief, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",44/44,5.0,"I really love my tea. It's a source of great joy to me. I start and end my day with a glass of tea more often than not. The yogi java herbal tea is one of my favorites. It tastes good and I know it's good for me which just makes it that much better. The flavor is great and the feelings of relief are wonderful after a long, hard day of work.My greatest feeling comes when I add 5-htp and phenibut (5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams) to the tea though; talk about an overwhelming calm! All the stress from my day is immediately wiped away when I use this blend! The flavor of the yogi and power mixed with those supplements gives me the ultimate rush of content. I feel so balanced when I have a glass of tea using those that it's almost intoxicating. The feelings are so hard to put into words.A bag of the tea is the perfect amount of flavor for my glass, with a little of each powder it's like a calm bliss. None of the day's baggage seems relevant anymore. I love that feeling. My mood is instantly improved and I am able to sleep soundly knowing I have the stress off my shoulders for the time being. It's a great way to enhance your overall well being. I suggest the blend to any natural tea lover like me!"

7891,American Crew Fiber,0/0,4.0,"This is a pretty solid product. Takes a bit of practice to get the application right - it doesn't do well in dry hair or in overly wet hair. Slightly damp hair is the way to go. Once you get the hang of that, the product is very useful. Holds most of the day, isn't heavy or greasy, and washes out easily. A little bit of this goes a long way, too, so the price isn't bad considering that a container will last a long time."
7892,Vicks Vicks Vapo Steam Liquid Medication For Hot Vaporizers Cough Suppressant,0/0,5.0,"there isnt much to rave about except it works well with unit, just the scent I needed, and packaged well. I have the vicks warm mist humidifier."

7895,Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet,0/0,4.0,"Received unit today and tried it out. Had used the old WJ7 for many years before it pooped out. Bought this thinking it was the same unit. They look the same but the old WJ7 weighs in at 2lb 6 oz and the new one weighs 1lb 3 oz. The most notable difference is the weight. The new version actually is better looking. Now for its performance. I liked the old unit because it would deliver a steady stream at an adjustable force. This delivers a stream with comparable force, and it is fairly non-pulsing like the first one. If you don't get a strong stream at first you probably have to make sure the pump is primed. As one other person said in his comments suck on the tip until it is primed. The one big question is"

7898,American Crew Fiber,0/0,5.0,"to show you how great CREW hair care products are, they have managed to get on the shelves at high-end salons, despite the fact that salons go out of their way to just by products that are not sold in stores, so that way you have to buy it there and they can charge high mark-ups. they are willing to lose sales (from people like me that just buy it online, knowing it is not exclusive to salons) as it is such a great product. there is no other hair product i can say this about.this on the other hand, is not only one that all the top stylists use, but one that you can get at a reasonable price both at the salon and online. whatever your stylist uses that you like, go on amazon, and you will see it is much cheaper."
7899,Bigelow Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,This tea is truly the best. It is the only thing that has helped during flu season. It controls the nausea and is delicious.
7900,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend and she really likes it a lot which is good because before i bought this for her she wore some terrible victoria secret body spray. So thanks Liz I appreciate it

7905,Munchkin Fun Ice Chewy Teether,0/0,1.0,Yeah so you don't get to choose whether you get the hand or foot and I thought I would take my chances anyway and got the foot which of couse my son isn't interested in. Waste of money
7906,"Self Transport Folding Wheelchair with Detachable Desk Armrests, Swing-away Detachable Elevating Leg Rests, Solid Castors and Large Rolling Rear Wheels.",0/0,4.0,This is a fairly good product and sold at very reasonable price. I would have given this product 5 stars if wheel rims were made fo steel. Over all build quality is good. I am only afraid of wheel rims breaking over period of time because they are made ofplastic.
7907,Cathedral Classic,0/0,5.0,My family and I really enjoyed this game. Good quality product. Word of advice. Dont leave it where the dogs can get to it. They didnt like it as much I guess since they ate all the pieces.
7908,Redneck Life Board Game,0/0,5.0,We got this game a little over a week ago and I'd say that we've played it more than ten times. Its really funny and I don't think there has been 1 person who did not like it. Be aware that you probably shouldn't play with younger kids because there is sexual references but it is a fun game!
7909,Alex Toys Kids Bath Crayons Tub Toy,0/0,5.0,Our 2 year old LOVES this. He has a blast the whole bath time. He even likes wiping off the drawings after. Great buy.
7910,Ambajam Mini Cuddle-Up Baby Blanket,0/0,5.0,The first one of these we got as a gift. I didnt push it on my daughter as her lovey; she just naturally took to it herself. She loves to rub it against her face while falling asleep. Since then I bought a second one to share the wear and tear with the first one. I also feel they are pretty expensive but hey what can ya do??
7911,Pravana Intense Therapy Leave-In Treatment 10.1oz,0/0,5.0,"For those of us with combination hair. Curly, thick and tangled after washing. This is the product for you. I use this for my daughter and it is the best product ever. As soon as you spray it on you can spear the tangles with your hands. We call this hair magic in our house. I love this product. It's a must have."

So far, it is not moisturizing as well as I wanted it to do. Hope it will, at lease, do its job during the summer time."

7921,Johnson & Johnson Johnson & Johnson Band-Aid Adhesive Pads Bandages Large,0/0,3.0,"I have long been a fan of Band-Aid Bandages since I was a kid, but these particular ones surprised me when it only barely stuck overnight on a scratch that I acquired from my one of my Poms. I'm now a little skeptical of these ones. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCPW8C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 and I bought quite a few, I'm hoping that this box is the only one that is like this!"
7922,"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Insert Replacements, 3 Count",0/0,5.0,I was given some extra Dr. Browns bottles as a hand-me-down but they were missing the middle parts. I bought two of these packs and they work just fine with both new and old bottles.
7923,Compression Gloves for Arthritis,0/0,5.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these gloves for myself. After I had worn one pair for a couple of nights with good results, my wife decided to try the 2nd pair for her arthritis. We both wear them every night now. These gloves work much better than less expensive arthritis gloves we have tried from other suppliers. These do work. They are comfortable, and well worth the difference in price."
7924,BIOSIL - 1oz. (30ml),1/1,5.0,"I was skeptical af first but figured nothing could make my condition worse than it was. (My hair rebelled after repeated relaxer and color applications.) After using Biosil for two months, my edges have filled back in and my hair appears thicker than I remember. After reading other reviews, I might up the recommended dosage to put my recovery into overdrive. I'll keep you posted."

7927,"Brown Medical SEAL-TIGHT Sport Cast and Bandage Protector, Arm",0/0,5.0,I had joint replacement and carpal tunnel surgery at the same time. I was in a cast and did not have any function of that hand. I was able to use this product to stay dry when showering.
7928,Allergroom Shampoo - Gallon,0/0,5.0,"We used this shampoo on our last dog, who sometimes had skin allergies. It's the best product and this size is the best price. We have started our new goldy on the same and her coat looks and smells great! It is very nice for sensitive skin and the smaller bottle had been VET reccomended."
7929,Lixit Original Dog Faucet Waterer,0/0,5.0,"I have this on the outdoor faucet all the time. The dog misses it in winter. I have to keep telling him the water is turned off :( I put a hint of peanut butter on it the first time and that was all it took. He drinks from it on his own all summer. It's always clean and fresh and I don't have to worry about some other animal drinking from it. If anything happened to it, I would buy another but it has lasted and lasted. I am able to use the faucet for other uses in conjunction with item"
7930,8in1 Yogies for Hamster/Gerbil/Rats,0/0,4.0,"Both of my rats love this treat, which I was a little surprised of as one of my two rats doesn't like any treats I've tried yet. The only complaint I have about this product is it doesn't come in a plastic container, but instead it comes in a plastic bag as most treats do. The bag is difficult to zip shut.Other than that, I'd highly recommend this!"
7931,Set of six Oster clipper guide combs.,0/0,5.0,"These guides fit fine on my oster clipper. I would recommend them to other clipper owners. I am not a professional barber, just a mom cutting hair at home."

7933,Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries,0/0,4.0,This is the second time we've purchased this 34 pk of Duracells. We just can't beat the quality for the price!
7934,Carnegie Collection- Saltasaurus,0/0,5.0,"I swear by the Carnegie Collection. Their dinosaur toys are very durable (for rough play) and wonderfully detailed, properly educating the children playing with them what these fantastic creatures really looked like. Most of the older Carnegie models are in scale with each other, which is also helpful for teaching children relative size. I mention this because this particular long neck might seem a bit small in relation to the other toys in the Carnegie line, but Saltasaurus actually was rather modestly sized compared to other dinosaurs. If you want a truly huge sauropod (long neck) dinosaur, try the Carnegie Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, or Diplodocus. That being said, there is a place in my heart for this little guy, who I've kept from when I was little myself!"
7935,Float Aqua Log for Pet,0/0,3.0,"This product is probably better suited for turtles and frogs. Some fish may like it. My fish could care less. When the fish are hanging around the top of the tank, especially while feeding, they may pass through it just to get to the other side...meaning they go through it because that is easier than swimming around it or under it at the moment. Otherwise they ignore it. Am going to try it in another tank with a different type of fish and see how they react to it."
7936,Chris Benoit Action Figure,0/0,5.0,"My reasons for writing a review on this figure, the Jakks Deluxe Aggression version of Chris Benoit, are twofold. First, it's good to see figures of Benoit still in heavy rotation on sites such as Amazon. If it influences just a few young wrestling fans to seek out and watch some classic Benoit matches, it's worth it. And of course, Jakks line of 'Deluxe' figures, first for WWE and now TNA, remain the coolest wrestling action figures by a large margin.The 2nd reason is the primary one, however; the only actual inspiration for this review is to fix the absurd one-star rating given by a clueless customer. His reason for the low rating is because he didnt receive it on time. So he's angry with either Amazon or one of their sellers, but he took it out on the product."
7937,Neutrogena Triple Moisture,0/0,5.0,I have very curly dry hair and this mask is my favorite
7938,Dr. Noy's Sitting Frog Plush Dog Toy,0/0,4.0,"Still in one piece with a Bulldog, the squeaker seems to have xtra protection around it to hinder the dog from tearing it out so quickly."

7940,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,4.0,"I agree with the other reviewers who said that the quality of the product is lacking; a couple of the plastic clips on mine frequently &#34;unlock&#34; and litter spills out onto the floor when tipping the box. I've resorted to attaching duct tape around the seams in order to keep litter in the box. Overall, I'm still satisfied with it because it does work and does make the task quicker and easier."
7941,"Kalencom Laminated Buckle Bag, Cream Corduroy",0/0,5.0,"I have 19 month twins and ever since they were born I have been searching for the perfect diaper bag. I had the Ju Ju Be Prepared when they were first born, but once we got past needing 6 bottles every time we left the house, and a million outfits, it was just too large. Brilliant bag, and I would recommend to any multiple Mom for the first six months or so. But ever since I have been searching for our next diaper bag. So many others were too small for twins. I'm also a organizational freak, I keep everything very neat and organized. I like to travel light, but at the same time be prepared for anything. Would have loved the JuJu BFF, but far too small, even for a singleton if you like to be prepared. And the Be All has that stupid flap for a Mommy Pocket. I ended up with the Be Mighty, which is great value, and worked for a while when I could attach it to the stroller, but once the girls were toddling and I wasn't using a stroller to get them from a to b it was just annoying, slipped off my shoulder constantly. Will still use it for swimming trips, spare clothes in the car etc, but just not as our every day diaper bag.This doesn't have a Mommy pocket, or many compartments inside, but it is fantastic quality, looks completely gorgeous, and is a brilliant size. I just have everything inside it in different color wet bags/pockets etc, and it stays organized brilliantly. The pockets on the end are too small for bottle's, sippy cups, but great for keys, lip balm, band aids, toddler snacks etc. I was very pleased by the quality of the bottle holder that comes with it, as well as the wet bag. The &#34;hot pink&#34; corduroy isn't too bright, much nicer color than I was expecting - chose that one because I got it for $23 dollars as a warehouse deal. Wasn't expecting to like it so much, the quality is just fantastic, would have paid $100. Really like the thick long strap. Now that my twins are toddlers I needed a bag that I could sling over my shoulder and wear messenger style while I take a toddler by each hand. I did consider a back pack for a while, but I needed to be able to continue wearing the bag and still access what was inside, while keeping toddlers close, so messenger style it was.Has stroller straps included with the bag, they are sewn into the bag and tuck neatly inside. Doubt we'll use them, but love that they are included."
7942,Brushtech Sports Bottle Straw Washing Brush B23C,0/0,5.0,Wow this thing is really long. I was surprised how long it was. I am sure it will do the job to get those exceptionally long straws clean that I have to clean from both ends with the shorter straw brushes. I don't have any straws as long as this brush is but it will safe time cleaning my straws if I can just push it though one end.

When my retired veterinarian uncle told me of cats using this with success I thought it couldn't hurt to try it! Both cats are on a special urinary health diet, and with a sprinkling of this I'm confident they will stay that way. Great product!"
7945,Sliding Door Locks,0/0,1.0,"My three year old son was able to forcibly knock this sliding door locking device off the day after I installed it. Granted, the sliding door was wood with somewhat porous grains, but the adhesive did not seem to work well at all."

7950,"Werther's Original Hard Candies, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"I like to keep these at my desk in the office for days when I can't take even a minute to eat a real meal. They keep my stomach from stirring up commotion by growling something fierce. They are tasty, not too sweet, and the shiny gold wrapper does a good job attracting passersby to stop and visit me for a bit."
7951,The First Years Take & Toss Spill-Proof Cups - 7 oz,0/0,5.0,We use these cups more often than our &#34;permanent&#34; cups. They're the right size and it's nice to have a huge set with matching lids (for a change). I'll probably buy even more.

7954,Geritrex benzoin compound tincture for skin protectant - 1 oz,0/0,5.0,"Benzoin tincture of benzoin is typically used as a treatment for damaged skin. It is often applied before applying tape or other adhesive bandages, especially if you have to keep taping and re-taping the same area. I use it slightly differently. I have a friend who is an avid skier and applies Benzoid Tincture to avoid blisters from skiing boots. When I told him about a corn I have on top of one of my toes which is irritated by otherwise very comfortable shoes, he suggested I start using a bit of Benzoid Tuncture on top of my toe. Since Benzoid tincture is often used as an antiseptic (due it the benzoin as well as its alcohol solvent) I felt safe using it on a corn that was irritated. I found that the compound really helps. Now my corn feels less irritated and less painful.I am attaching a photo that shows an open container of the benzoin tincture (photo can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo). The content is a dark brown thick liquid that hardens a bit as it dries. A small hole in the cap allows you to dispense a small amounts. The liquid does stain if you spill it as I found out the first time I applied it to my toe. Now I put something under my foot as I apply the compound.Overall, using it on my toe every day made me more comfortable and I recommend it.Ali Julia review"

7958,"Zadro Triple Vision Gooseneck Vanity and Wall Mount Mirror, Chrome Finish",0/0,3.0,"I ordered this because it had a two mirrors with magnification in addition to a regular mirror instead of just one with magnified mirror as many do. The drawback is that the magnified mirrors are not on opposite sides of each other, but on opposite ends. Truthfully when I buy a magnified mirror I do NOT want it to come with a regular mirror at all. All bathrooms have regular mirrors so why would I need another one - esp a small one? Anyway I would like this a lot more if the magnified mirrors were back to back that way I could mount it on the wall and have access to both magnified mirrors. I also find that I do not use it as much as I would have since it is not lighted."

The product photo clearly shows 7 distinct colors/flavors (blue, green, yellow, red, white, purple, orange) and doesn't match what I received.

I couldn't find a better rated foot spa to take a chance on so this seemed to be the best idea to cover the possibility that I get one of those One Star Lemons.I came back to Amazon to order it but I could not find the Replacement Plan as an option so I headed back to Brookstone to order it.That's it... just thought I'd mention the replacement plan to you and to Amazon cuz I know that Amazon reads every word I write, right! geo"

The string was also fairly weak and broke after a few days of use. Not that finding another string is hard, but it was definitely annoying. If i could go back, I would probably shell out some extra cash to get a higher quality gyroscope."
7977,K&H Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed,0/0,3.0,We bought this for our &#34;outside dog&#34;. She loves being outside when its hot and when its cold....whines when we bring her in.So we bought this hoping to make her huge dog house just a bit warmer. She got to use it for 2 months before it just stopped working. I would not recommend this item!
7978,"Revlon Moon Drops Lipstick, Frost, Varied Colors",0/0,1.0,"the quality isnt what I expected from revelon, but that might be from the shipping. Arrived on time, but the lipstick was all melted and left a big mess in the cover, so it was irritating and messy when I opened it."
7979,CK Products Halloween Decorating Sprinkles,0/0,4.0,"The taste is very good. Some jimmies that are colored black can have a slight off taste, but these taste very good. The color is black. I have had other black jimmies which were more on the dark grey side or worse a brownish black."

7981,Biolage Hydrating Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"My hair tends to be on the dry and frizzy side. My hair dresser recommended this product because of price and the excellent pH balance. It softens and smooths without weighing it down, and can often find it at a great price. Will use it for life!"
7982,Golden Alaska Deep Sea Omega-3-6-9 Fish Oil 1000mg,0/0,4.0,"Great Price for Quality indicated; I've been using this brand for over 1 year & my good cholesterol numbers are fantastic & although, not scientific, I do attribute it to these fish pills."

7984,Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing,0/0,2.0,"I loved this swing, I should have read the reviews before registering for it! With in the first month of using it, the mobile did not work anymore. Fisher price expected me to take it apart and trouble shoot it... When on earth did I have time for that. We started using the portable bouncer/swing.I pulled this swing out to use on my second child. After using it 3 or 4 times it decided not work at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BETTER SWING!"
7985,"Mariella Burani by Mariella Burani for Women, 3.4 oz Eau De Toilette Spray",0/0,5.0,"I also love, love this fragrance, but the price has skyrocketed. I understand that demand drives price, so I'm not too mad. I just spilled half a bottle on my vanity, but I have to have it. Poeme is also a very nice but a slighter less expensive fragrance."
7986,MRC Prodigy Express,0/0,5.0,"I would recommend this controller. It is very easy to hook up and operate. The sound coming from my bachman engine add a whole new level to my railroad.On a side note, the first one I received was defective. it had some kind of short circuit and started smoking. Amazon has a very freindly and easy return policy and I had a replaceent in about 8 days"

7989,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set,0/0,5.0,"A great train set for boys and girls! It has all the things you need in a starter train set, and is much cheaper than some other big brand sets. It works well with other wooden sets and trains, and fits nicely on a train table in a couple of formats. The bridges can be tricky for little ones, as the risers are easily knocked over, or out of place, but other than that, it's been great fun for the entire family!"
7990,Contech StayAway Motion-Activated Pet Deterrent,0/0,1.0,"Product DOES work, but I'm not sure at what range or angles. Also, one can select sound and air blast, or just sound, but not just air blast. The sound has taught my cats to jump every time my oven beeps, or my tablet beeps, or when the microwave goes off. If I had been ware there are similar products out there that offer just the puff of air, I would not have bought this one."
7991,"Snoozer Lookout I Pet Car Seat, Small, Highland Maize",0/0,5.0,"This product is awesome! I tried it out officially yesterday and it took my puppy a bit to get used to the idea, but then he loved it and really enjoyed it! If I can post a picture of him, I will, he's adorable and such a good dog. I would highly recommend this for people and their pets, because it has a great secure way to attach to a seatbelt as well as his harness to the seatbelt for added safety. I highly recommend this product! I'm so happy it went on sale and I got it! I also purchased the medium size, as to give him room to grow and that way I wouldn't have to upgrade, if I had gotten the small size. I also love that it's lightweight and fits just perfect in the front seat of my car (which is a small sedan). No more carrier crate for my dog!"
7992,Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller,1/1,5.0,"Bought this stroller because my 2 year old would not sit in our single stroller and we now have a 4 month old. We traveled for Christmas and this stroller was perfect for the airport and visits to stores. It is a bit heavy, but what else can you expect from a double stroller? It folds up almost as well as our City Mini but is a little bulkier. Overall this is the smallest double I have seen.This stroller is also very sturdy. My very active toddler was swinging from the handle with nothing else attached to the stroller and it did not flip or even fall over. I also love that the back &#34;seat&#34; is adjustable, sliding back and forth to where your child prefers it. (The seat belt in the back was also a must for us) There are lots of ways your older child can ride. This stroller is perfect for anyone with two small children.."
7993,Conair CHV14JXR Extreme Heat Jumbo and Super Jumbo Rollers,0/0,3.0,"Actually I haven't used this that much since I bought. It is not very easy to use, and considering it may hurt my hair a lot, so I just tried twice and I gave up cuz it didn't last long, just couple of hours."

7997,"OrgraN No Egg Natural Egg Replacer, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)",0/0,3.0,"I believe this works better for cooking in recipes. If you try and make it as an egg dish, it does not taste good, in fact it's really bad."
7998,Gears! Gears! Gears! Super Set - 150-Piece Set,0/0,4.0,"This is a very unique gift. Our boys love to build with blocks, wooden tracks, and play with Legos. It has been an interesting additon to the building toys. They did need to have some adult help to fully understand how gears work, but are able to manage just fine now (ages 6,5,and 2)."

8004,L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System,0/0,1.0,"The worst hair color product I've ever used!! This didn't cover any of my grey, and I only have a little at my hairline and by my temples. The scent is overwhelming! So bad, my eyes watered and it took my breath away. I color regularly so I'm aware there will be an odor but this is unreal. It was also difficult to saturate all my hair. I will pay a little more and go back to John Freida foam, a bit more money but a much better product!"
8005,Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck,0/0,3.0,"Used the whole container, but couldn't discern any visible change. Cream goes on easily, feels nice, and smells good...but I wouldn't buy it again."

8007,"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White",0/0,3.0,"My 2 month old daughter battles with congestion. I was told the only things I can do were saline solution, use a humidifier and have the baby sleep elevated. The Nap Nanny is ideal but 1. It has been recalled and 2. Even if you ignore the recall you can only use the Nap Nanny for up to four months. So I bought this product in hopes of having my daughter in her crib.I use it along with the humidifier. The first few nights it worked fine. But my baby moves around in her sleep so she manages to slide off in the night. Coincidently she has not slept thru the night for the last three days.I'm sure it works for others, and maybe there is still hope for us, but for now I'd rate it as just ok."
8008,"Sally Hansen Insta, Dri Insta, Dri Anti, Chip Top Coat",0/0,4.0,I love painting my nails and have been stuck on doing my own French manicure lately. I wasn't using a top coat per se. I was just using Sally Hansen Diamond Strength hardener as a top coat but that wasn't working out all that great ( its not a proper top coat polish i know) My polish was chipping within a day forcing me to do constant touch ups. I got on amazon and decided to give the Sally Hansen insta-dry anti-chip top coat a try. (I also got some good tips from product reviews) I remove all the old polish with polish remover. Wash my hands really well with soap and water. Dry completely. I put a light layer of the diamond strength hardener and let it dry (only takes a few minutes) then I apply whatever color I want. Top it off with the insta-dry anti-chip polish and I'm good with no chips for a good week or so.The thing is that the directions say apply nail color. Wait two minutes. Then apply one layer of the top coat and it will dry to the touch in 30 seconds. This is true. IF you only apply one layer of color. If you apply two layer of color and then apply the top coat it's not quite dry to the touch in 30 seconds. But when it does set...it sets good. I like it. Leaves my nails hard and super shiney.

8010,"KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Peanut Butter",0/0,5.0,"My dog has a medium Kong and the large treats fit in perfectly. Usually the treat alone is not enticing enough to keep her going after it, so I put a bit of peanut butter or cheese way at the top of the Kong and block it with a Stuff'N Snack treat. You may have a little bit of a drool mess from the dog going crazy to get everything out of the Kong, but it definitely will buy you 15+ minutes by keeping your dog busy!My dog knows that I stuff her Kong every day when I am home for lunch. You get 30 in a package; if you use them as much as I do, you're better off doing the Subscribe & Save so you get them shipped to you without you thinking about it and save a little in the process."

8014,100% Unrefined Certified Grade A Shea Butter 4 oz.,1/1,5.0,"This is my secind time purchasing this product. I bought to uspe as a moisturizer instead of the high dollar ones at the pharmacy. My 5 yr old nephew licked his upper lip raw. My sister purchased high dollar creams but it didnt work . I put this shea butter on his chapped raw skin twice and by the next day it was completley healed! I use it as a skin cream and I am thrilled that it tightens the neck skin, reduces puffy eyes and erases fine lines. I swear by this cream and just placed another order. Its lightly scented and a little goes a long way!"
8015,Deluxe Tilt Overbed Table,0/0,3.0,"It is strong, BUT has a side to side wobble. Its greatest weakness are its casters. They're plastic and will break surprisingly easy. DO NOT subject the casters to hard impact and DO NOT put stress on the rolling casters."
8016,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"This stuff is awesome. I mix it with water, about one scoop - 6-8 oz of water and I make sure to mix it right when I dump in the scoop. With fifteen seconds of mixing you let it sit for 30 seconds and you have the most delicious almost milk shake you could ever have. It tastes like melted french vanilla ice cream, which is amazing. Mixing it like I do I rarely if ever get chunks and when I do they're small and still taste great. I would highly recomend this product. It is super awesome. I would ask anyone to find a downside to this product, for what it is(whey protein) it could not be better. It's perfect and I love it. Now only if I could affford an unlimited supply........"

8026,"Shea Butter Lotion Bar, Lavender Citrus",0/0,5.0,"I have been using these lotion bars - various scents - for years. They are really good.They last long and smell good, and they hold up if you keep them for a long time. I find them especially good for very dry skin and for hands that get washed constantly, e.g. health workers, restaurant staff, etc. They also make a good lip balm despite not being specifically marketed as such."

8033,Sing Along CD Player,0/0,1.0,"This CD player is a piece of junk. We have trouble getting any CD to even play. As much as my 3 year old loves music I was really hoping for an exciting Christmas morning, but was very disappointed. The microphones are too short and only one ever worked. Sound quality is poor. It does not even come with a plug to plug into the wall. Super cute and was hoping to have something portable but for the price I expected much better quality. Save your money. Google the singing machine...around the same price and much better quality."

Mine is used for my kitty, so he can go in and out of the balcony by himself. Three treats on the other side is all it took to train him to use the door. It can be placed temporarily or permanently.

8042,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,0/0,2.0,"I love that there is an off switch, and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on. My baby received this as a Christmas gift, and she likes it quite a bit, hence the second star. But why, oh why, didn't they put a volume switch on this thing though?!My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister, and it is ok for the first few minutes, but it is so darned LOUD, I'm practically loosing my mind. I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang. The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too. But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously considerPlayskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary), it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong. It's nice and quiet, too."

8048,The Doggie Catcher for Cars,0/0,4.0,"First of all, do not use this as a safety harness; it even says on the package that it will not keep the dog safer in an accident. What it DOES do is keep the dog from roaming around your car, or jumping out as soon as you open the door. But we have had a few times when we have had to brake quickly, and it kept our dog from flying toward the front seat, so it did keep her (and us) safe in those cases. We wish we could use a dog safety harness, but she just won't wear one... so this was the next best thing, since we could use it with her current harness."

8052,Snoozer Lookout Car Seat,0/0,5.0,"Our puppy loves her car seat. Hops right in, has a great view forwards and backwards. Then falls asleep like a toddler. Very soft, very lightweight and easily transfers from car to car. Only downside is our pup chewed through the strap and we had to use another strap to hold her in. You can use about anything that loops around the seatbelts and hooks to a harness on the dog. Probably good up to about 15 lb dog."

8067,Enjoy Luxury Conditioner (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"Ordered this on a recommendation from someone else who has naturally curly hair. Love the Deva Curl products for my hair but this conditioner is amazing! Having curly hair it needs to be wet everyday to style. I was washing my hair 3+ times a week and just wetting it the other days. New tip I learned---get it wet everyday and condition it. Especially if you have curly hair it gets frizzy so easy! Now I just wash 2x a week or less. This is truly a luxurious conditioner and a little goes a LONG way!!! I usually the size of a dime to a nickel and my hair is long, down to the middle of my back. Definitely worth the money. But add it to your wish list and watch for the pricing. Can range from $17-25 a bottle. I waited until it was around $18. One down fall--the design. This stuff is so thick it doesn't come out of the bottle well. Softer plastic that you can squeeze would help with that. Been using this for 2 months now."
8068,The Official Bullsh*t Button (BS Button),0/0,5.0,I bought these as gifts. The people loved them and their friends. People wanted to know where I got them. Yes I would recommend it.
8069,Step 2 LifeStyle Dream Kitchen,0/0,5.0,"After having researched for quite some time I decided to go with this toy kitchen and i have not been dissappointed!! My 20 month old daughter loves it! She especially loves the cooking noises that the stove top makes, as well as the phone, the microwave and the oven!! It is the perfect height for her. It was fairly easy to assemble. The instructions were clear and it took me about an hour to put it all together. I did use an electric drill to make it easier for myself but for the most part a regular screwdriver is fine. I would highly reccomend this product! It does not dissappoint!!!"
8070,Majestic Pet Crate Pet Bed Mat,0/0,3.0,"The photo gave me the impression of significant sides to this crate mat. In reality, the mat is actually flat. Might be okay for an indoor dog (on a carpeted floor, maybe?), but I bought anticipating that this would be a gift for an outdoor dog. This is a well constructed product, but not suited for our needs."
8071,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,0/0,2.0,"Save your money and purchase a plain type of strap band, this is a joke, I don't see any good support."
8072,Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,0/0,5.0,"The Moby Wrap has been a godsend for my baby's nap times. While he sleeps well through the night, he's never been able to nap well on his own. A friend mentioned that she used the Moby Wrap for her children's naps. We decided to try it out, and got somewhat mixed results in the beginning.After getting a bit more experience with the wrap, we found that the most important thing was to make sure his legs were properly and comfortably folded underneath his bottom. Secondly, we've found that keeping the wrap looser works better for him to nap easily. I used to try make it as snug as possible, but found that this makes it very difficult to keep his body straight (which makes me have to keep my body in a weird position).Overall, this is probably one of the best purchases we've made for our little boy."
8073,"FURminator deShedding Tool for Cats, 1.75-Inch Edge",0/0,5.0,I bought this for my girlfriend as her cat sheds a lot of fur. Neither of us could quite believe the amount that it removed. Buy this and save your furniture and clothes from getting covered in pet hair!
8074,Rolling Knee Walker Leg Ankle Foot Crutch Caddy Scooter,0/0,5.0,"I suffered from a torn achilles tendon. Until I got my knee walker, moving around with the upright walker was slow, tiring and hard on my hands and arms. Thanks to my knee walker, I'm moving around quickly and with very little effort or wear and tear on my body. I wish I had gotten it sooner!"
8075,Big 100 Colossal Bar,0/0,5.0,"I bought these because they popped up on a deals site for ~$20 or so.When they were delivered, I was initially put off by them"
8076,"Stretch Island Original Fruit Leather, Summer Strawberry, 0.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 30)",0/0,5.0,"My daughters love the taste of these fruit leathers, and I like that they are a healthy snack. We use these for lunch box snacks and they are never around for very long because they get eaten so fast. Thumbs up for a great product."
8077,Hemp Seed Hand and Body Lotion,0/0,5.0,I have been using the lotion for a long time and have found nothing better. It is non greasy and the scent is very nice. I use Dreamsicle.
8078,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,The Pampers Baby Dry are the BEST diapers we've found. No more leaks in the middle of the night makes for one happy baby!
8079,Lionel FasTrack O36 Curve Track 4-Pack,0/0,4.0,It is a well made product. It is easy to assembly. My grandson love it. Only problem is that the connector part can be easily bent.

8081,Medline Grab Bar,0/0,5.0,"This is a solid, non-slip grab bar. A great buy for anyone helping an elderly person shower. An excellent attention to the shower."
8082,Hartz Ultraguard Plus Flea &Tick Dog Collar,0/0,4.0,This item was a good price and made it here on time. The description was accurate and I like that can be made to fit.
8083,Intex Sit N Float Lounge (Colors May Vary),0/1,5.0,heading on vacation and want to use these. Have purchased these before from somewhere else with no problems. So hopefully won't have any problems. Packing a couple extra just in case. nice to float upright and also to lay back in a little. Cheap enough to leave there if we don't want to hassle bringing them back...The next people can enjoy.
8084,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,0/0,5.0,My sister recommended this product to me and I do like it. Mind you I have super long thick hair and this dryer makes it a good experience for me.
8085,"Nuby 2 Pack Insulated No Spill Straw Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,He loves drinking water out of this straw cup. Great design and easy to clean. I highly recommend it for 1 thru 3 year olds.
8086,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,1/1,5.0,I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it didn't feel dry on my already dry lips!
8087,Active Ankle T2 Brace,0/0,5.0,Not cheap but the alternative is much more costly. The ankle roll is common and most dangerous for kids. This eliminates the risk without limiting performance.
8088,CranActin Cranberry AF Extract By Solaray - 180 Vegetable Caps,0/0,5.0,"This product is still a favorite - and the price is right. Used mostly to keep UTI's at bay. So far, so good!"
8089,Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery organizer with Removable Tester,0/0,5.0,This organizer is worth it. It keeps all the batteries very organized and the tester is also a plus. I like this product a lot.

8092,"Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer, 4-Ounce Bottle",0/0,4.0,"Good moisturizer, not too thick. One squirt is enough to cover your face. The smell is ok too. Would maybe try again."
8093,Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,"Most bags are way too big for schlepping a few incidentals. In mine I carry pen/pad (in a pocket designed for that), shades, phone, change, hand sanitizer, keys, etc., with plenty of room to spare. A smallish paperback or e-reader fits nicely. Sturdy construction. Completely zippers up, so no more spilling your stuff all over. It has a nice masculine look, splits the difference between too girly or outlandishly faux commando. If mine ever wears out (not likely). I'll get another."
8094,Carcassonne,0/0,5.0,"I love the expansion, wish I would have started with the big box set to begin with!!!! But am looking forward to adding additional expansions."
8095,HEAT WAVE Instant Reusable Heat Pack HAND WARMERS - 4 pack = 2 pairs Heat Wave; PLUS FREE CARRYING/STORAGE CASE,0/0,1.0,I purchased these based on my experience with a similar product from Campmor (which no longer offers this product). You get 20 minutes of heat (max) and it is NOT hot. The one I bought from Campmor 15 years ago gets almost too hot to touch and lasts for 2 hours. I will be returning these.
8096,HTP Plantar Fasciitis Heel Seats,0/0,1.0,This product was a complete waste of money!!! I brough this product to the podiatrist and she recommended throwing them in the garbage. I was unable to return this product so it went in the recycling bin. Poor quality and construction and probably cost fifty cents to fabricate.
8097,PCA pHaze 13 Pigment Gel-1 oz,0/0,1.0,"I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN. I HAVE THE COMPLEXTION OF ABOUT A SHADE DARKER THAN BEYONCE THE SINGER. THIS PRODCUT LITERALLY BURNED OFF MY SKIN. MY DARK SPOTS GOT DARKER. I REPEAT DARKER. THEN WHEN I WASHED MY FACE BY THE THIRD DAY THEY PEELED OFF AND PINK FLESH APPEARED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ETHNIC PEOPLE. NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX MY SKIN FROM THIS DAMAGING PRODUCT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY THIS PRODUCT ANYWAY, GO WITH THE TRAVEL SIZE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AS A MEANS TO TEST IT OUT. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. GOOD LUCK TO ALL."

8105,Jack Black Face Buff Energizing Scrub,0/0,4.0,"Very nice product. I love the menthol, but my boyfriend thinks its a bit weird. The exfoliation is very light, it's not intense at all."
8106,"Ware Manufacturing Canvas 8-Panel Clean Living Small Pet Playpen Cage, Large, White",0/0,5.0,I purchased this as a pet gate to keep in my bunny in my back room (a 62&#34; span door opening) I spread it out and it stretched about 80&#34; (maybe a little more) and works perfect!!! The wire is somewhat thin and bends easily but that does not bother me. It keeps my little bugger in where she belongs. It is tall enough that she can't jump over it but short enough to step over it on my tiptoes.
8107,Gears! Gears! Gears! Super Set - 150-Piece Set,0/0,5.0,"I like this set a lot --- it is even challenging for the adults who are playing with children --- this is a good thing! And, I like that you can put it away in the case it comes in --- also a good thing!"
8108,Heritage Store Colloidal Silver Soap,1/1,4.0,"I use this product to bathe my dog, a bichon frise, who has really sensitive skin. He also has a lickoma, which I'm trying to get healed.I can't say whether the colloidal silver is helping heal the wound, but the soap makes a great lather and cleans his thick curly hair very well. I'm hopeful the product will help the wound as well."
8109,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,1/1,5.0,I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it didn't feel dry on my already dry lips!
8110,Max Factor Pan-Stik Ultra Creamy Makeup .5 oz (14 g),0/0,5.0,"I have been using this all my life. No other cover stick even comes close- creamy, blends in perfectly, and lasts all day. This is a product worth searching out on the internet."
8111,Clairol Beautiful Collection Semi-Permanent Hair Color,0/0,5.0,"I use this product all the time. I cannot use permanent hair colors, so this suits my purpose perfectly. Love it"
8112,"Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews",2/2,5.0,"These are the best. My dr. was upset that I had not been taking the statin drug he had prescribed, but quickly changed his mood when he seen my bloodwork. In 3 months my cholesterol went from 209 to 180. My triglycerides went from 104 to 72. Hdl went from 67 to 73 and Ldl went from 121 to 93. I took 2 or 3 benecol chews a day and also used smart balance butter with plant sterols in it. I have always used real butter (part of my problem with my cholesterol), but this butter tastes like the real thing. I have been watching my diet a little more than I used to. I am very pleased with the results. The Dr. said he was going to do some research on the benecol chews, because he had never heard of them before. He never said another word about me taking the statin drug he prescribed and I don't have another appt. for a year. The only bad thing I have noticed with them is the waxy residue on your lips and that they are a pain to open, but that is nothing compared to the potential side effects from taking statin drugs."
8113,Atrac-Tain Moisturizing Cream,0/0,5.0,Used it only three times on some sad cracked heels. Very quickly they improved. Almost like a miracle (I've tried many things).

8116,"Viralys (L-Lysine) Oral Gel For Cats, 5 oz",1/1,4.0,"I couldn't get my cat to voluntarily eat any of the &#34;treat&#34; versions of L-Lysine. With the gel, I can squeeze a blob onto her fur and then she has to lick it off (very sneaky, I know). I've been giving it too her four about a week now and her eyes already look a little clearer and sneezing has subsided."
8117,Gu GU Energy Gel- 24 Pack,0/0,3.0,the price is very goodi got it on timethe only think i didn't like is that the product can be used until feb 2014
8118,Manhattan toy Baby Stella Doll,0/0,5.0,"I ordered this doll for my 17-month old daughter. I loved it from the moment the package arrived. She's so soft and adorable. It's very well-made, and seems sturdier than other dolls she owns. My daughter opened this on Christmas and was instantly enthralled with removing her magnetic pacifier. She loves to push this doll around in her shopping cart, put it in her high chair and carry it around the house. I would recommend this doll for anyone, regardless of the child's age. It's just a very nice doll all around. Great product!"
8119,F.A.S.T. Hair Growth Shampoo and Conditioner Combo Pack - 12 fl. oz. each,0/1,5.0,I just got it this product today. I was using Nutri-Ox shampoo and conditioner and it was $30 for a little bottle. These bottles are very good size. The shampoo and conditioner do not stink like Nutri-Ox did. Its not the best smelling but it doesn't smell bad at all. This product got here right on time. We'll see how this goes I will do a 30 and 60 day update. :)
8120,The Mommy Hook The Mommy Hook,0/0,5.0,I was impressed when this came in the mail. I didnt look at the size dimension so when I took it out of the box I was in shock. This hook is huge and sturdy. This hook will hold alot and I'm pretty sure it wont bend. It's not hard to open the clasp however due to the size and durability smaller hands (children) will struggle.
8121,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,1/1,5.0,I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it didn't feel dry on my already dry lips!
8122,L'AIR DU TEMPS For Women By NINA RICCI Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"I like this product, a good gift for my mom, it's portable, an confortable, just what I expected at a great price, she has really enjoyed this product, the product arrived in time, the box was well protected for shipment"
8123,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,4.0,"I wish it was water proof, but other than that it works great. It is worth the money if you do not want top of the line."
8124,PediFix Arch Bandage,0/0,5.0,I've had heel pain for a few months now. I noticed a difference after the first couple days that I used it.
8125,Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat,0/0,5.0,"I really loved this seat, it looks great and stayed put. It was very easy to clean and easy to transport. Unfortunately, I did not make it a must all the time and he stopped using it alltogether. Make them stay in if at all possible!"
8126,Ketchup,0/0,5.0,"If you are counting carbs, calories and fat in your eating plan, these products are the best. I have tried the ketchup, barbeque sauce and salad dressings. The taste may not be what you are used to, but you will grow to love them."
8127,SENSE-ible No-Pull Dog Harness - Black Medium,0/0,5.0,"This harness was recommended to my by a dog trainer for our shepherd mix that has not been able to learn not to pull on her lead. This has made life a lot easier. We also had this item disappear in shipping the first time and after a bit of back and forth communication with the seller, it was reshipped at their expense."
8128,Revision Teamine Eye Complex 0.5 oz.,0/0,3.0,"My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and gave me some samples. I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles. I have been using it for 2 months morning and night. The Revision website states the product will:*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles*Smooths the look of fines lines and wrinkles*Firms and brightens skin and provides antioxidant benefitsThe product did none of these things for me. The only benefit was softer undereye skin (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same. In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product - I did not. I do not recommend this product and will not be repurchasing it."
8129,2 Professional 35% Teeth Whitening Refill Gel Sets - Optimized Formula By Watts Power White,0/0,5.0,"Really like this product, bought with the watts thin trays. Tastes gross but to be expected, if possible roll pieces of paper towels to sit on gum lines and one final folded paper towel in between trays towards back of mouth to catch extra saliva. Helps to not dilute gel in trays and not taste residual gel. Did get some irritation on gums but I wanted it on the gum line to make sure it was really white there. LOvE the demineralization gel, calms everything down and the minty taste is really nice after doing the trays! Highly recommend!"
8130,Playtex HandSaver Gloves,0/0,4.0,These gloves are great to protect your hands when you're washing dishes. I use burning hot water and I don't feel a thing.
8131,Now Foods Vitamin A 25000 IU,0/0,4.0,I love this brand. These vitamins are very good. Maintaining good health is important to me and vitamins are a welcome addition in my busy life. I would purchase them again.
8132,"PowerBar Performance The Original Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars",0/0,4.0,"Will tire your jaw chewing but it is very dense energy bar. The flavor is decent, not too gross to eat."
8133,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,My husband suggested these for our new dog as it came recommended from 4 of his family's dogs.Our dog enjoys these treats and they help with her teeth! So chalk her up as another dog who would recommend them to others. These seem like a safe bet if your dog is picky with his/her treats.
8134,Bonine Motion Sickness Protection,0/0,5.0,Long story short. Dramamine knocked me out. After one day Bonine didn't make me tired at all. First night I was tired then I adjusted. 2 flights 8 day cruise no issues. Awesome.
8135,North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate,0/0,5.0,"i bought this for my 1year old baby, it only take me about 10minutes to installed, but more important is this gate make from metal, seems very strong, safe comes first, so i give five stars"
8136,Duri Cosmetics Rejuvacote 0.61oz,0/0,4.0,"I have been trying this product only for 10 days. For the moment my nails look and feel stronger. They say you have to use it every day and after 7 days take it out and start again, but I had to change it after 4 or 5 days because it started peeling"
8137,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/1,1.0,"I ve always been a pampers user.. used cruisers size 5 for my son 2 yrs old and 32 lbs and they were great at daytime and used huggies overnight at bedtime...my husband got a giant box of these by mistake from a store , they were cheaper so I decided to give them a try.. BAD DECISION.. not soft at all and they leak after one hour of wearing them, terrible.. and they are smaller than cruisers so they don't fit well.. DO NOT BUY"
8138,Bachmann Trains Plasticville U.S.A. Log Cabin with Rustic Fence,0/0,4.0,"This is a very nice addition to anyone's &#34;landscape&#34; layout. The only reason I did not give it a five, it has to be glued together in order stay put, and there is no glue included."
8139,Samsara,0/0,4.0,"This is VERY hard to find, so I was grateful to find what looked like the last one on the Internet. It is a gift and the outer box is battered at the edges, but otherwise it's find. Arrived very quickly and well-packaged. All in all, just fine."
8140,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,0/0,5.0,Very good product! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips. I would buy one in every flavor!

8142,Rubee Hand & Body Lotion 16 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I knew this lotion since I was in Cameroon, in Africa. When I came in USA, I found it and I was very happy!! It smell good, keep your skin moisturized, and helps protects from the X-ray!! Just love it, one of the best lotion I ever had!!!"
8143,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,"This litter box is extremely easy to maintain and you won't have to ever scoop litter again. Just rolling it once a day and emptying are the easiest things I have ever done in regards to litter maintenance. The top comes off easily to allow for cleaning and all of the parts are made from a durable plastic so there won't be any bacteria growing. It also works to keep the odors inside and my cat loves have a private little place he can go into. My cat is 15 pounds or so and I purchased the extra large just to be sure he would absolutely have enough room. It fits him perfectly, he can turn around and get to different parts of the box. I would definitely suggest getting the alrger sizes no matter what though because it is just more sanitary for the cat.I have not had any issues with the tabs becoming loose or falling off when I roll the box nor have I had any litter spill all over the floor like some other reviews claimed. You just have to roll slowly and it will work just fine. I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of scooping, smelling, or seeing their cat's litter. Guests will come over all the time and inquire about, always impressed at how easy and efficient the process is."
8144,Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control,0/0,5.0,"I am a professional stylist and I won't use any other kind of curling iron. If you are not very good with curling irons this is a great learning one as well, because it is so good it will help you be better too!"

8146,Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz,0/0,4.0,"The price is far less than you pay in the store. When you buy this, but the cleaning brusk kit as you need to clean this once a week and if you go longer it gets slimy and without the brushes you will be heading to the store to get a toothbrush to &#34;try&#34; to get to the areas needing to be cleaned. The cats all seem to like it and we have to fill the tank 2-3 times per week."
8147,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"This is my favorite flavor from ON. It tastes so good, and it is the perfect reward after a hard workout."
8148,Omron Sprague Rappaport Stethoscope,0/0,3.0,I wouldn't say it's great but it's also not that bad&#8230; You get what you pay for. You can hear things okay with it but not the detail that I was really looking for. I would spend a little bit more and get one that's a bit better.

8153,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easel,0/0,5.0,"I was very easy to put together, one pieve was cracked then sent a 2 replacement pieces even though I only needed 1.My daughter truly loves it!!!!"
8154,Jarrow Coconut Oil,0/0,4.0,"First of all it is well packed. My son and I took a few moments to realize it was sealed on the plastic. You have to rip it off along the perforated lines. It is sealed under as well which is nice. The oil is really nice. It smells great and has a very mild taste which I enjoy. It isnt overpowering. I am used to coconut as being pretty strong so this was a change of pace for me. Regardless, it is a fair price. It is a good product and give it a shot. Coconut oil is supposed to be good for you and does have a lot of uses. You can even use it on your skin if you so desire."
8155,Pay Day Board Game (Editions may vary),0/0,5.0,"I loved to play this game when I was a kid, so I purchased it for my 10 and 8 year old. They both love to play it. You pick how many months you want to play the game for, so that determines how long the game will last. It is a great game for them to understand the concept of money...paydays and bills!"
8156,Clubman Pinaud Styling Gel Hair Styling Creams,0/0,5.0,"You can't go wrong with this gel, especially for curly hair, it styles and holds without an impossible grip. Great buy."

8158,Loupe Magnifier - 10x Triplet Folding Loupe Magnifier - High Quality Imported BelOMO Lens (10x21mm with 17mm viewing area),0/0,4.0,"Nice clear field of view. I gave it a 4 out of 5 possible stars because it neither comes with a carry case and also has no good place to attach a lanyard so I won't lose it. That said, I think I can be creative when it comes to finding a way to keep track of it. I'm happy with my purchase."
8159,"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack",1/1,5.0,"I've been using Alli since September and I have lost 42 lbs using this product! Alli has literally taught me how to eat low fat, because if you don't, you will experience the &#34;treatment effects&#34; that they explain in the packaging. If your serious about losing weight, and you've tried everything, try Alli. I love it!"

8162,Glico Chocolate Pocky 2.82 oz,0/0,4.0,"The chocolate itself is amazing, but the box was crushed when it arrived. Other than crushed chocolates, it tastes good"
8163,Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver,0/0,2.0,"I always thought that the Braun shaver would be a great product, so when my Norelco shaver died I purchased this model. At first the shaver wasn't that great, but the directions said if coming from a rotary shaver you wouldn't get great results at first. After using for three months I still didn't see much improvement. I put it aside and used a Gillette razor and shaving cream. I started using the Braun razor again just recently and I am still disappointed in the results. Shaving cream and a razor for me."
8164,Child Sized Push Broom,0/0,1.0,This item is not a push broom as advertised. There is no angle to the head at all. The Schylling Push Broom is excellent. It is very easy to use and my little one loves it. Amazon has it starting at $8.99.
8165,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,5.0,"I had the clippers for a few days before I used it. I was rereading the instruction sheet (which includes pictures as well as text in 2 languages on how to cut hair) hoping that the info would soak in. The first thing that I shaved off was my (several inches long) winter beard. The clippers took it down to a 5 o'clock shadow before I thought I even got started. No scratches, nicks or skin irritation and I was easily able to shave the rest off with a regular razor.Next I attempted to cut my own hair per the instructions and did pretty well for a first time. I missed a few places on the top back of my head. My sister-in-law who uses this same brand of clippers to cut my brother and their kids hair finished it up and in time with practice I should be able to do it, although I suspect that the back of the neck will have to be finished by another person.I normally pay including tip $17 for a similar haircut at Fantastic Sam's. So with the next cut it will have more than paid for itself. It seems like it will last a long time. A small container of blade oil is included. In case anyone is wondering an [eye] brow trim guide is not included in this kit. An ear trim guide is included."
8166,Thomas Labs Brewer's Yeast & Garlic (5 lb powder),0/0,5.0,"Brewers yeast is essential component for dog health, garlic at this concentration is added to naturally control pests. Glad to found it on amazon. Quality product at great price."

8168,"Alli Weight-Loss Aid, Orlistat 60mg Capsules Refill Pack",1/1,3.0,"You take it 3 times a day with meals. It works by blocking the fat molecules from being absorbed. Where does the fat go, you ask? Well there is only one place to go. The first time it hits you, it feels like you might have diarrhead in your pants. You rush to the bathroom, and you found what looks like red pepper infused olive oil coming out. Then you have one hell of a BM. The oil is a lurbricant, and a very good one at that. It's like no other BM you've ever had. When you wipe, it's all red pepper infused olive oil. Think about trying to wipe oil off of a frying pan using paper towels. It takes a lot of paper towels to wipe off all that oil. Oh, and again, it's a &#34;lubcricant&#34;, so think about that how ever you wish.This product doesn't deny any of this oil leakage, and in fact, you really should expect it based on the description and function of the product. The product does block you from absorbing fat; therefore, it does it's job.If you can deal with the experience I described, then this might be for you."
8169,Wellness Canned Cat Food,0/0,5.0,"Timmy and Belle, my two Persians, love these! Wellness has different textures that they sell other than regular pate, such as cubed and sliced. The minced kind is the best, in my opinion, the chunks are not too big and my cats can eat them easily. Also, turkey is their favorite kind. I would love it if they start making these in the large 12 oz cans!"
8170,"Glad Quick Tie Large Trash Bags, 30 Gallon, 40-Count Bags, (Pack of 4)",0/0,1.0,"I bought these because it says ""STRONG"" right on the box, and wow is that false advertising. Half the trash bags already had small tears in them before we started to put anytihng in them, and the rest all ripped the minute anything was added to the bag. Seriously, we were not being rough with them or putting sharp objects in, these are just the cheapest bags I've ever seen. Glad should be ashamed, I guess you get what you pay for."

8173,Hartz Chew N' Clean Assorted Colors Dental Duo Toy and Edible Dog Chew,0/0,1.0,Part of the product description says &#34; Delicious sizzlin' bacon flavor that keeps them chewing for hours.&#34; It lasted about 10 min before I had to take them away from my dogs. They chewed up the plastic trying to get to the treat in the middle and I was afraid they would eat the plastic as well.It is hard for me to find items that my dogs can't\wont chew up quickly. I have 2 yellow labs and they seem to be able to destroy just about every chew toy I've ever tried. Personally this product doesn't work for my needs so I would not buy this product again.
8174,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set,0/0,5.0,"I was amazed at how extensive this set was. Comes with tons of tracks, buildings and a handful of trains. So many kids things are so overpriced, i was pleased of this value. I originally wanted to buy the Thomas brand roundhourse, crane and buildings, but then i realized that my kids could care less about the brand. We do however get the Thomas trains, the melissa and doug ones are okay and supplement our thomas ones. These are a nice wood and well made. Very happy with this purchase!"

8177,Amazing Herbs Black Seed,0/2,4.0,"I haven't opened this one yet, but I will be using it as soon as I am out of my last one. Black seed is a great source of omegas, this one is priced great, arrived quickly and I am looking forward to using it."
8178,"PureAyre Pet Odor Eliminator Refill, 1-Gallon",0/0,1.0,I tried this on cigarette odor and cat smell AFTER a deep cleaning. I was not impressed so I gave it another round of generous spraying. It still did not perform as expected. I returned the product and they did refund my purchase price
8179,GuideCraft Farmhouse Collection Toy Box,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. She points to all the animals and says their name and the noise they make. The only problem was that the screws/nails that hold the bracket under the lid broke. All I have to do is get a copy more screws/nails and it will be all fixed.The toybox is well made and very sturdy.
8180,Tommy Hilfiger Tommy Cologne Spray for Men - 3.4 Fluid Ounces,0/0,5.0,"I've been wearing this since freshmen year of high school, and I've never worn something that will stop women dead in their tracks and say that I smell good. What I like most is the subtlety of the fragrance. It's not over powering, very light and fresh smelling. When i received it through Amazon, I had put it on that day and that evening I went to go have a drink with some buddies. This women said she couldn't help but tell me that I smelled amazing. All other colognes I've tried were too strong, and have been described to me as if I'd taken a shower in the fragrance, but not Tommy! I highly recommend this product after all my field tests, and it's fairly inexpensive for what you get. Everybody is different, but in my opinion this is the one for me."
8181,My Lip Stuff- Tube - Over 600 Lipbalm Flavors Available,0/0,5.0,Very good product! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips. I would buy one in every flavor!
8182,Solvit Waterproof Bucket Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,4.0,"I was skeptical when I first received because it seemed kind of flimsy. I have 3 dogs that go to Starbucks with me every Saturday morning and this is a great product. Easily cleans up, just brush off hair, nothing seems to stick to it."
8183,"Solaray - Malic Acid With Magnesium, 90 capsules",2/2,5.0,"I have restless leg painful leg syndrome and had gotten to the point where I was having 'Charley Horses"" several times a day. Dr.s had me all doped up with meds;that weren't doing anything except making me fall asleep. An elderly lady told me to try the Malic acid with magnesium and with one dose the muscle cramps and 'Charley Horses disappeared immediately. When I advised my Dr. about it he started several of his other patients with it. It has been a life saver for me. I couldn't go without it now. Thanks to this medication I can now live a normal life."
8184,Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic,0/0,5.0,having been using this for 2 days for a moisturizer and hand cream. it is the only thing that has worked for my dry hands.
8185,Cadet 1-Pound Bag 100-Percent Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats,0/0,4.0,"My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that some pieces were huge and hard. Hard like a brick, hard. Most were not though. So maybe it was a fluke. Pup enjoyed them nonetheless."
8186,Wahl 4-Ounce Clipper Oil,0/0,5.0,Not much to say about a container of oil except that it is authentic Wahl brand clipper oil and should last for years.
8187,"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Black",0/0,5.0,SHe does not really chew on it and maybe I should have got a softer one as a result but I can stuff it and wipe peanut butter on it and it takes her a while to get bored. I may try freezing something in it next. I bought two to change them out...
8188,Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder,1/1,5.0,Exactly what i expected. High quality creatine powder. I highly reccomend ON products. Has no taste and mixes well with water.

8190,"NaturVet Kelp Help, 1 Pound",0/0,4.0,"It has a slight fishy smell, but my dog loves it added to her dry food along with warm water.She won't eat her food in the morning (breakfast) unless this product is added and soaked in water. It's a great price and I think it has actually helped keep her skin and coat healthy (along with her Canidae)."
8191,Real-Ease Neck and Shoulder Relaxer,0/0,4.0,"Have to find the right position and surface, but it does help to alleviate neck and shoulder pain some what"
8192,Carex Bed Buddy Warming Footies,0/0,3.0,"The slippers are well-made, but I didn't know they were scented. I bought them as a gift for a man, and he hated the scent. He also said they don't hold heat for very long. Great idea, though."

8194,Cosco Designer Separate Car Seat Base,0/0,1.0,"Although in the description of the item, it states that it is compatible with Eddie Bauer Car seats, it was not compatible with my Eddie Bauer Trail Hiker travel system car seat. So if you are trying to find a base compatible with that system, do not buy this one."
8195,Galt Folding Trampoline,0/0,5.0,"I've had this for two years. My husband put it together and didn't find the assembly too difficult. Just pay attention to the orientation of the handle bar while assembling.My son used this in physical therapy to help him to jump. I also saw the same trampoline in his occupational therapist's room. So I thought it'd be great to have at home. He loves it. It took him about a year, but he finally got the hang of jumping."

8199,Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Lip Butter-Dark Chocolate & Peppermint,0/0,5.0,"This stuff smells great! It goes on clear and the gloss isn't overly shiny, it looks very nice with or without lipstick. I don't wear lipstick so I just go with it. It's not too greasy or slimey or anything."
8200,Petmate Kennel Cab,1/2,4.0,"I am returning this crate because after running a few errands around town with my dog in it, I feel she is too cramped for comfort. Because of the rounded shape of the kennel, the floor area is a lot less than you would think. I measured the interior width at its widest point and it is just 13"" (Large size advertised width is 18.6""). The width is only 12"" at the door and far end. I wrote the rest of this review before doing a test drive. I still feel it's a pretty good kennel for the money.I bought the Large. The measurements on amazon were accurate"
8201,"Kyjen Puzzle Plush Egg Babies Dog Toy, Fish, 5 Eggs",0/0,5.0,Very durable item and even came with replacement speakers. Skittles loves it and is still playing with it a month after she got it.

8203,"Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch",0/0,3.0,"This may be a very good styler,however it does not do a good job of drying the hair. Could be for those with less thick/coarse hair."

8206,"POOF-Slinky 0SA221 Scientific Explorer My First Mind Blowing Science Kit, 11-Activities",0/0,3.0,The experiments weren't &#34;mind-blowing&#34; enough for the 5 year old who received it. This might have been due to lack of patience on his part or maybe he wasn't quite ready for it.
8207,Capisette 60 Caps Natural Edema Balance Stop Swelling,0/0,5.0,I have used the product every time my legs swell. It does not take long to work...the first one you take starts working right away.

8212,Dymatize Nutrition ISO 100 Whey Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,it is an excellent supplement..if you are looking for a protein in low calories.. this is the one you should buy.
8213,"Clif Shot Bloks Organic Energy Chews, 2.1-Ounce Packets",0/0,4.0,"Having tried a lot of &#34;sports foods&#34; that left me feeling sick and regretful mid race, run, ride, or hike, I sought something that was both easy to carry AND digest. If you tend to sweat out a lot of salt you'll know how just drinking water doesn't end up hydrating you on a REALLY hot day. I tested these clif blocks all the way up Mt. Diablo in the summertime and although I ran out of sports drink half way up, I refilled at the ranger station and kept my sodium intake up with these guys.Probably not a good idea if you have or are being treated for hypertension, but otherwise go for it. They work and they kept the heat stroke away."
8214,American Biosciences (Immpower) DGP Dog Gone Pain Mobility & Flex for dogs,0/0,5.0,"I have Olde English Bulldogs. Have owned them for decades. I got tired of the usual steroids and medications for their old and creaky bodies and began looking for something easier on their system, especially their stomachs. For whatever reason, Rimadyl caused havoc with my Bulldogs intestinal tract after prolonged usage of a few months. A friend of mine recommended DGP, figured I'd try it after a GI bleed episode with my male Bulldog who was on Rimadyl. I believe my dog functions just as well on the DGP as he did on the medications from the vet. I realize when and if he gets real bad I'll have to do something else, but for now, the DGP appears to be doing a good job."
8215,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,I wanted a light gray color and this fits the bill. It got to me very quickly. Very easy to apply.
8216,"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30"", White",0/0,4.0,We bought this to go on a Stork Craft dresser for our toddler's room. It fits nicely and I'm thankful that it came with straps and screws to attach to the back of the dresser; otherwise it slides around when I'm putting my daughter on or taking her off of it.
8217,North States Supergate Stairway Gate,0/0,3.0,"It's an alright gate. It's really flimsy, but I purchased it based on price. So I suppose you get what you pay for. I was also surprised when it came that it had to be mounted to the doorway with screws."
8218,"RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, 1-Ounce",0/0,5.0,"First off, if you don't like scented creams then this isn't for you. But I love the smell and feel of this night cream and indefinitely noticed visible changes in my skin."
8219,KONG Teddy Bear Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,Very good quality item. My dog is still playing with it a month later! Good value and highly recommend A+
8220,"Mack's Earplugs, Kids Size (Pair), 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I'm a pretty light sleeper, so I take these earplugs on every trip I go to and I keep them next to my bed for those rare occasions when my roommate feels the need to do her laundry at 2am. These earplugs block all of the noise so I can sleep and they're actually pretty comfortable. Also, I love taking a hot bath at the end of the day and submerging my head underwater to wash away all my stress. These work perfectly to keep the water out."
8221,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,5.0,"They go crazy for these. I have two mini schnauzers and although they get excited for regular treats, they go crazy for these!!"
8222,Capisette 60 Caps Natural Edema Balance Stop Swelling,0/0,4.0,I bought this product to reduce the inflammation in my calfs due to what my doctor calls Periphereal Edema. I had been using compression stockings and my doctor prescribed lasix to flush excess water from my system. I tried this for more that 9 months with little relief and lasix is toxic to kidneys so I was looking for a way to reduce the edema without this toxic addition to my regimen. As a diabetic...the one thing I don't need is a pill that is bad for my kidneys. So in an effort to reduce the use of these harmful drugs in the amount prescribed....I went to Dandelion Root and bought some neoprene compression sleeves...which seemed to help. Bought the Capisette on 12/28/2012 and have been taking double doses of it since then...and the results so far are more immediate than the things my doctor prescibed. The swelling is going down and the color is returning to my skin. The spots are drying out and itch occasionally. I plan to continue using Capisette until the issue is resolved and may continue to take the recommended dose forever if need be.
8223,BareMinerals Brushes,0/0,4.0,I like this concealer brush. I've been using it for about a year now and I wouldn't switch it for anything else.
8224,AquaClear Intake Stem for Power Filters,0/0,5.0,"This is a strong spout for the filter its the same as the one that broke but this gets better flow. I have a 55 gallon and my aquaclear 70 creates mini and micro bubbles that sweep the top layer of the gravel.. Better then the original one. After this I'm thinking about getting a aquaclear 110 I'm impressed and my guppy had her fry and they survived that current till this morn, but the debris is no match to the suction from the spout."
8225,Safe-T-Sport Neoprene Knee Sleeve - Closed Patella,1/1,4.0,The product definitely works however I don't like the fact that once I start running it starts sliding out of place.
8226,"Floxite Fl-10h 10x Hand Held 2-sided Mirror with Stand, Clear",0/0,4.0,"The mirror itself is sturdy and the magnifying power of the one side is awesome! My only complaint is the stand, which is a great idea in theory, but it seems cheaply made."
8227,Dmso Gel 70/30 Aloe Plastic,0/0,3.0,It is very suitable for joints. Dmso gel aloe reduce the smell but are almost as effect as Dmso gel 90%
8228,ProLab Creatine Monohydrate 600g,0/0,4.0,"This is good stuff, helps on muscle recovery and gives me more energy in the gym. But its not going to help you if you&#8217;re not eating the right diet. FOOD IS EVERYTHING."
8229,Disposable Blue Underpad Chux,0/0,1.0,"The service was good, but the pads were terrible. They had a thin covering over plastic with no padding for absorption. Pretty useless for 7 puppies peeing all day long (:0)."

8235,"LeapFrog AC Adapter (Works with LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS Explorer, Leapster Explorer and Leapster2)",0/0,5.0,"My daughter loves her toy, and for some reason, the AC adapter included stopped working. I bought this one, even when it says that it is not compatible with the Explorer products (I decided to give it a try) and it works perfectly. It is EXACTLY the same that came with the LeapPad 2. Buy with confidence!"
8236,Wel-Pac - Saki Ika Hot (dried squid) 2.0 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"This stuff is great. I bought it a few years ago at a Japanese market and I thought to look for it again on Amazon and I found it! It's kind of tough, but that's expected because, well, it's squid. I absolutely love the spice in this. It's not overpowering, and it tastes a bit sweet as well so you get a mixture of both sweet and spicy. Also, it doesn't have an overtly fishy flavor which you may think before trying, but the fishy taste is mild."
8237,"Snorestop Extinguisher, 0.4 Oz -Plastic Case",0/0,5.0,works for me. Have used this for awhile now it works I use a nasal spray with it an this works for me.

8239,Nails Alive 6 Second Polish Dryer,0/0,5.0,"This is the best nail drying polish I have ever used. For some reason Sally's stopped carried it, and I was excited to see it available through Amazon. The name is slightly different then the one that Sally's carried, but it is the exact same product. I highly recommend it."
8240,Jumbo Checker Rug Game,0/0,5.0,"It is great for the kitchen table. Also the pieces are nice ,and big. Lastly I would like to say if your looking for something inexpensive and fun to play with, this is the thing to buy."
8241,Bohnanza,0/0,5.0,"This is a great game for families. It is the most fun with 4-5 players, in my opinion. 7 players is a little much and the game seems to drag a bit. The best part of this game is that while other players are taking their turn everyone else is still really involved as they can potentially trade with the person taking the turn. This is a favorite game for our extended family and a must on every vacation (plus it is a compact size).I've never played it with younger children but my sister's family enjoyed it and she has younger kids, at various ages. We just call this the &#34;bean game&#34;! Get this and you won't regret it!"
8242,Gianni Versace Dreamer Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Just sprayed the first spray of my second bottle of this stuff and the dry-down is absolutely wonderful. Everything I remember. Its clean, smoky, spicy, and sweet. In that order. But what keeps your nose glued to your wrist is that perfect, very subtle sweet note in there. I guess its the wildflowers. I don't know if ""sexy"" is the best word to describe The Dreamer, but it's definitely attractive. You'd be hard pressed to find to smoother fragrance at a cheaper price."
8243,Thieves Spray - 1 oz by Young Living,0/0,4.0,"I don't feel I have had it long enough to use it enough to see, or experience, the full effects of using it. That is why I have given it four stars. I have added it to the home made surface cleaner I make and it smells great and seems to be doing the job.I have not used it beyond our house to know what it is like spraying it on shopping carts, etc."
8244,"Kong Catnip Cat Toy, Squirrel",0/0,5.0,"I've purchased three of these squirrels now. Emmy had the first one for a while and she LOVED it. This is by far the best received cat toy I've purchased for my two cats. Fiona prefers to attack pens and batteries and doesn't care too much for cat toys. Emmy lives for laser beams and her squirrel. I think the larger size of this makes it easier and more fun for her to attack, and the big bushy tail makes it more fun for her too. I don't know if it's more realistic, or gets her attention more or what, but I bought a different Kong animal and it wasn't liked as much as this squirrel. Even without the catnip she loves it. We tossed out the first squirrel when we got fleas. She's on her second, and it occurred to me that she'd be devastated if they ever stopped making it, so I got her a back up just in case!!! We always find the squirrel in new places and we love it! The best is of course when she sleeps with it :)"
8245,Four Paws Safety Iguana Leash and Harness,0/0,5.0,"My bearded dragon only wiggled out if it once, and that was because I didn't put it on properly! It works just fine and people are highly amused to see a lizard on a leash."
8246,Flash Cards,0/0,5.0,This is a great set of cards. There is only one fact on each card versus the cheaper sets that have facts on both sides!
8247,Childrens DHA 250 mg Strawberry Flavor By Nordic Naturals,0/0,5.0,"My kid loves this stuff. In fact, she loves it so much she helps clean the table after dinner so she can get it faster. What more can I say?"
8248,Rake Set,0/0,4.0,"It came pretty quickly and works great. My boyfriend asked me why I needed such a big scooper since when I got it our little guy was just a puppy. Now that he is a little older and a lot bigger, he sees how useful it became when his potties were a lot larger! The rake could be a little sturdier, but works for what I need it for!"
8249,Premier Buddy Oh's Dog Treats,0/0,3.0,"My dogs, two mixed breed hounds from the humane society, were not wild about these. They liked the toys I put them in but didn't like to eat the treats after they fell out."
8250,Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers,0/0,5.0,I never have to run out and buy diapers. I always have them when I need them. I just place another order when I am on my last package. Huggies is a great brand. I have used these with all 3 of my kids. I tried Pampers but all my kids broke out. So I stick with Huggies.!!

8253,Calico Critters,0/0,4.0,These beds are better used apart than together. They are smallish for the Critters and the ladder doesn't stay on well but my daughter still enjoys them.

8255,Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair,0/0,5.0,"It is so nice to have our baby eating at the table with us and not separate from us! It's easier to feed her and she loves it, too. It's easy to take off and on, travel with, and clean. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to avoid the bulky normal highchair. We love this!"
8256,Maggi Seasoning,0/0,5.0,"If you are fan of Maggi you know what are you buying.Good price for a big bottle of liquid gold.As for those who are unfamiliar with that product-try it it is saltier version of soy sauce, great with soups and stews ."

8259,"Finish Powerball Tablets, Fresh Scent",0/0,5.0,"Price is great. Compared to other similar products, it works well, there is no big significance though. Easy to store and use."
8260,Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil Concentrate with Omega-3 Fatty Acids - 400 Softgels,0/0,4.0,"This is good to take every day. It does not replace a good diet, but if you eat well and take this it is GREAT. If you eat like crap and take this it won&#8217;t do you any good."
8261,WAHL 9962-717 Compact Travel Trimmer,0/0,5.0,Had one of these before and liked it so much we bought a new one after we dropped the other one a few times.
8262,PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,I have been using this automatic feeder for my cat for 2 years. I programmed it to dispense food twice a day and it never failed. I'm still using the original battery. I have 0 complaints. Highly recommended!
8263,Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips,0/0,4.0,"I've been using these strips on and off for the past few years and have been immensely pleased with the results.Firstly, the product is simple to use and painless. Simply wet your nose, apply the strip, wait 15 min then remove. If you remove before the strip has hardened too much, removal should be painless. (Hardening to the point of painful removal usually happens if you wait longer than 15 min. I've been using this product for some time and have only once accidentally left it on too long so that removing was painful.)The best part is the results. This removes a lot of dirt from your pores upon your first use. If you use it regularly after that (such as weekly), you'll see a decrease in the amount of dirt in your pores.It's not often that I stick with a beauty product (lotion, shampoo, hair conditioner, etc.) for years at a time, but this is the one product that I always turn back to for deep cleaning my pores. I've found nothing better. Definitely recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"
8264,Country Life Potassium,0/0,5.0,"I have only taken this suppliment several times, and that without a problem. Sometimes I am sensitive to supplements, but this one seems to work just fine without a problem."
8265,Sportsheets Beginners Bondage Fantasy Kit,0/0,4.0,Far exceeded my expectations for the cost of the product ! Just a fun little surprise and add some variety in the bedroom .
8266,Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,0/0,5.0,"arrived on time. nice quality. heavy material. wide enough for my car seat. the only constructive feedback i have is the seat height, although i thought it would be needed, my car seat doesn't really touch the back so although, added protection, I'm not sure everyone will need it - car seat dependent."
8267,Grit Pack for #130 or #140,1/1,5.0,It was part of a gift for my grandson along with the rock polisher. Feedback was good from my grandson.

8271,SweatVac Headband,0/0,3.0,HUGE and I have a big head. Like the color and it does absorb sweat well. Had to take it in so it would stay on my head during yoga!
8272,Coverlet Adhesive Bandage 2 Inches X 3 Inches - 50 per box,0/0,3.0,"Hypoallergenic and 'latex free' are two different things- I am allergic to the adhesive on the tape- our local drug store was out of the hypoallergenic bandaids so I bought these on line as I was running out while dealing with a wound-- sadly, I can not use them, even though I need them urgently, I will have to drive around tomorrow to find bandaids that I can use without my skin falling off.The box looked like someone re-taped it shut after being opened...They are probably good bandaids, but the description needs to clearly state that they are latex free vs. hypoallergenic."
8273,Pyrex Portable Hot & Cold Pack Combo - Large,0/0,5.0,Great replacement for my old pack that stood up to 6 years of use. The old one finally wore out and this is great.
8274,North States Superyard Play Yard,1/1,5.0,This is perfect.It arrived with minor damage from shipping. There was a hole punched in the box and there was minor damage to one of the panels. I contacted customer service and they shipped me a new panel no questions asked.Love it. Love the customer service. I would not hesitate to order from this company again.Oh and the playpen works great too.

8277,"KONG ZoomGroom, Dog Grooming Toy",0/0,5.0,i use this on my dog before and during bath time. it combs out all the loose hairs and then can be used as a scrubber (gently!!) to help wash the dog.
8278,Health Plus 100% Pure Psyllium Husks Plastic Bag,0/0,4.0,"Well what can you say about plain old psyllium fiber? This stuff does wait it is supposed to. The only drawback is that you need to put it into a different container or zip-lok bag, since it comes is a regular non- resealable plastic bag."
8279,Radio Flyer 32S All-Terrain Steel and Wood Wagon,0/0,4.0,"My daughter fell in love with this at first sight. Handles well and I am able to pull her easily over many terrains.The only problem is that I have never smelled anything so horrific in my life. We pulled it out of the box to assemble, and my husband & I both had a headache within minutes. Its such a wonderfully classic and useful design...it's just a shame that it is not manufactured in an earth friendly, health conscious way. After a month outside...smell seems to have subsided. I just hate to think what is making that odor. C'Mon people............lets do it right."
8280,"West Paw Design Zogoflex Dog Toy, Hurley, Large (Colors Vary)",0/0,4.0,"Another great Hurley Toy--although I really like the Bumi &#34;boomerang&#34; a bit better. This is made out of either the same or similar recycled material(s). This bone is a bit on the heavy side, however, if you happen to have a smaller dog. Great for a lab or similar sized dog."
8281,Melissa & Doug Boston Terrier Plush,0/0,1.0,The dog doesn't (can't) sit. It wasn't a fluke either. I order two! Both front legs were too short! So annoying!
8282,Premium Madagascar Vanilla beans 1/4 lb by JR Mushrooms,0/0,5.0,I read a recipe online to make my own real vanilla extract and ordered these beans which came quickly and packaged well. I've used several beans and will save the rest. Wish I knew whether i could freeze the rest of the beans or if they will be fine in refrigerator?
8283,Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser,0/0,4.0,"This stuff will leave a smelly residue, so wash the food bowl each day. Other than that, the dog loves it, I just squirt it on his food and he eats it right up. Ordered a second bottle. Definitely keep refrigerated, even though it doesn't say to(or maybe it does?), or the smell will happen more quickly."
8284,MEGA Bloks Fill & Dump Wagon,0/0,5.0,This was the best Christmas present for my 1 year old nephew EVER! He's still playing with it and he's over 2 years old!
8285,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/0,5.0,"purchased this for when my grandbabies come to visit. They seem to really enjoy it especially when the vibrate is on. Wish the little toy that plays music played it a little longer though. Otherwise, very good product. Well made - nicely cushioned."
8286,Hempz Body Butter,0/0,5.0,Best body cream ever and will continue using it and recommending it to my friends.The best what else can I say when I say it is the best
8287,Fantasia IC Pure Tea Silky Gel Moisturizer Activator 16oz,0/0,5.0,Love this product! Curled my course hair and left it looking very healthy. Not drying. I am very pleased. Money well spent on this item.
8288,"Cats Rule Fish Watering Hole Fountain, Blue and White",0/0,3.0,"This fountain is so cute that it almost makes the design flaws forgivable. The filter keeps too much water out of the pump chamber so the pump does not always work right. I took out the filter, I just change the water a lot. Then the tube that connects the fish to the pump came loose from the ceramic fish and now it won't go on the pump right. After a few weeks of working OK, now it doesn't work at all.Love the form, hate the function."
8289,Manic Panic Amplified Cream Formula,0/0,1.0,"I've been dying my hair for about 15 years, this isn't my first alternative color either. Absolutely nothing happened. No joke. It said let sit for 30 min, I let it sit for near 2 hours. Total bulls***"
8290,Elemis Sp@home Japanese Camellia Oil Blend 100 ml,0/0,4.0,"have faithfully uesd this oil every night during pregnancy, pleasant smelling. it's quite oily so allow time for skin to absorb prior to dressing. though the development of stretch marks is largely genetics and weight gain during pregnancy, and as far as i've read cannot be really prevented by any cream, i still enjoyed using this to moisturize my skin every night during pregnancy."
8291,"Glass Magic Performance Booster, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)",0/0,5.0,"thanks to the new regulation removing phosphates, the detergent no longer work. got to have this stuff. Without it the grime and spots just build up."

8293,"Goya Maria Cookies, 7-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 24)",0/0,2.0,"I had another brand of Maria cookies and loved them so decided to order some but didn't know what brand they were, just that they were in a red package.. I decided all Maria cookies should be good as its a simple cookie..not so, these a re slightly over baked and leave an after taste like when shortening or oil is rancid...and I had to order a case which is 24 packages...boy will I not make a mistake like that again...I only have myself to blame..just hope the Goya company checks their baking times and their ingredients...never again...."
8294,Elasto-Gel All Purpose Therapy Wrap - Elasto Gel,0/0,5.0,"I have chronic back,neck and shoulder pain and the Elasto-Gel products are the best for retaining moist heat and my previous wraps lasted for 6 years and I microwave them 3-4 times a day. I use this wrap for my back mostly. Sometimes my left thigh.I highly recommend this brand. I have bought other brands in the past and they don't last as long and they're not gel. The gel provides cushion."
8295,After Shave Balm,0/0,4.0,"So I get bad razor burn and all the products I've used in the past worked only slightly, not completely clearing my irritations up. But this aftershave balm certainly does the trick. I have not had a problem with razor burn in months since I started using this product. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is it is a bit pricey, but you really don't have to use that much so the tube should last you a good amount of time. Really a great product."
8296,El Yucateco Achiote Red Paste,0/0,5.0,"arrived REALLY quickly. tasted great in the soup i made, and i have more than enough for many more soups."
8297,MRM CLA Hi Potency 80%,0/0,3.0,I maybe notice a litte better muscle fatigue but havnt really took it like i should. The jury is still out

8299,Wood Checkers with Stackable Ridge - Dark Brown/Natural,0/0,5.0,"These are great for checkers. My grandfather had a set of checkers when i was a kid that were similar to these, so these are quite nostalgic."
8300,Stork Craft Hoop Glider & Ottoman,1/1,4.0,"This chair is very cute, sturdy, and well made. The only thing is it is a bit too tight I'm 5'5&#34; and 160 lbs during pregnancy it felt a bit tight on the sides. After baby was born its comfy, but would go for a bigger size or different chair. Other wise great chair for the price. Would recommend."
8301,"SE Pick Set, 12Pc Stainless Steel Wax Carvers",0/0,5.0,"I bought this for my clay carving. It has all the tools and then some for what I use them for in my clay work. This is a hobby that I don't spend a lot of time doing but when I do, it's nice to know that I have all the tools I need collected in a nice package.Am very happy with my purchase."
8302,DKNY Men by Donna Karan Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 oz,0/0,3.0,"Just very common fresh smell, lemon note. Like a rot apple. Cheap smell. Also the bottle looks cheap. Cannot understand the high rates here. Will never buy Donna Karen perfum any more."
8303,Metrex VioNex Antiseptic Towelettes,0/0,5.0,"I have used Vionex Towlettes for decades and have found them quite useful and effective as hand washes and color-fast spot cleaners for clothes!For the flu season, they become even more vital and convenient, particularly on-the-road!!I use them daily!!"
8304,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/2,2.0,I use Pampers during the day and have to switch to Huggies for our night diaper...My son is 17 months and every other morning he wakes with a leaky diaper :o( Clothes soaked...bed soaked....I sent my last box back.

8307,Twining English Breakfast Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,Came across this variety of Twinings on the Queen Mary 2 where it seemed to be an almost unanimous choice. It tastes great and is of obvious high quality.
8308,Konsyl Konsyl Natural Fiber Laxative,1/1,5.0,"very detailed and graphic description below.a little background on myself. just shows constipation can happen to anyone. im 32 yrs old, male, very active, and in great shape. i rarely eat red meat. i eat a good amount of fiber. most fiber is beans, greens, and brown rice. i take probiotics every day. and i drink alot of water.i have had a history of constipation my entire life. it got so bad, that it is all i would think about the entire day. is going to the bathroom and how much better i would feel if i did. because my stomach had so much pressure and hurt. i didnt feel like being active. i was going to the bathroom maybe once or twice a week. alot of the time due to some sort of laxative. and when i did, it didnt feel satisfying. it would be very thin poop.i came across konsyl and after reading the reviews i had to try it. i read this in one of the other reviews and it really helped me. so im gonna put it in caps. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BY FAR IS TO KEEP TAKING THIS FIBER EVERYDAY TWICE A DAY FOR ATLEAST 2 WEEKS. its gonna bloat you, maybe give you some stomach pain, and definitely give you gas. but it will start working.i was severely constipated when i started taking konsyl. i took it 3 times a day (before breakfast, before lunch, 2 hrs after dinner) for the first week. after 48 hrs i finally went. and i went alot. then next day i went alot more. at first it was diarrhea then after a couple of days it became a more solid stool. and i couldnt believe the size and circumference of the stool. it was AMAZING! haha. finally i felt relieved when i sat down to go #2.i have been on konsyl fiber for 3 weeks now. i have cut down to taking it once a day (trying to relieve a little of the gas). i usually go #2 everyday, if not then i will go the next. i cant believe how this has changed my life. my mood is alot better. my energy is through the roof. its even helped clear up some sinus problems i have had. you can drink the fiber in water straight up, but i dont recommend it. i mix it with a scoop of Ultima Replenisher and about 8 ounces of water in a water bottle. shake it up and drink it. and make sure to drink plenty of water during the day.hope this helps atleast one person. happy pooping. &#62;:]"
8309,"Olay Age Defying Protective Renewal Lotion, 4 Ounce (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,I have been using this product for only a short time but have noticed a nice improvement in the health of my skin. It is well worth the money.
8310,Rainbow Light Men's One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,if You are looking for a natural food Based but not organic vitamin this one is the best priced! Good quality vitamin. Easy to take. Husband loves them

8314,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,"Very good while it lasted. My husband discovered that if we push down on the rubber piece inside the water cup, we can get it to work."
8315,"Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Peppermint, 40-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I love peppermint tea. I've tried at least 10 different brands, but have yet to find one that I like anywhere near as much as Celestial Seasonings. If I'm going out and know I'll be offered tea, I bring my own, because most other peppermint tea's taste so bland to me - not just weak, but often unpleasant.This has a really strong flavor compared to most. To make the most of it, I use 2 bags in every cup, and leave them in. Starts my day with a kick!"
8316,"Corolle Mon Premier Tidoo 12"" Baby Doll (Tidoo Suce Pouce In PJs)",0/0,5.0,My granddaughter is enjoying this item. She plays with this doll in the tub each night. Most of her dolls are not water friendly so she enjoys this very much.
8317,Avalon Organics Conditioner Strenthening Peppermint -- 11 fl oz,0/2,1.0,"Over the years I am a hair product junkee looking for something that really works. My hair is dry and bleached out so I thought I would try this product but it does not work on my hair at all. I can't even finish the product, I am throwing it out. It does not condition my hair like I thought it would from reading the reviews. I was hoping it would work better because I want to use more natural products but without the conditioning, I was pulling hair out when I combed it after I washed and conditioned it. I tried Avalon shampoo too and am not impressed."
8318,"Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Double Chocolate, 16-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)",1/1,4.0,"Not much can really be said about most hot chocolates of this type, and this hot chocolate is no different just because it has a fancy name and packaging, and that the primer uses every adjective available to tell you how chocolate it is. I guess we get to pay more for that type of product privilege.Having been somewhat tongue n' cheek above, hot chocolate tastes better with warm/hot whole milk than mixed with hot water alone as a fast hot drink, duh. This chocolate seems to have a richer flavor mix than the ""no-name bland brands"" found in dollar type stores. Again, you usually only get what you pay for. This chocolate mix is really no better than other similar name brands without the fluffy primer descriptions. I say, just find your best price on brand name mixes. This brand's chocolate mix should not be considered a premium mix. Here's why"
8319,Shiseido Shiseido Facial Cotton,0/0,5.0,"Creme de la creme of cotton pads. Does not waste product. This pack is smaller than those jumbo but cheap packs of cotton, but it will definitely last you a while. The speedy delivery was much appreciated!"
8320,Clearly Natural Liquid Glycerine Hand Soap Refill Unscented,0/0,5.0,"It's almost impossible to find unscented glycerine soap in stores anymore, since Trader Joe's discontinued theirs.I recommend it to anyone who has problems with scented products. It's great soap."
8321,Millesime Imperial Cologne by Creed for men Colognes,0/0,4.0,Since I don't like a very strong scent - it's good for me because I don't have to pay $300 for original product.
8322,Complete Basic Window Cleaning Kit By Ettore Products Company,1/1,5.0,"My windows look better than they ever have before. I'm really pleased with this product. No streaks, no runs and no drips."
8323,Everlasting Treat Chicken,0/0,4.0,"Treat works really well. Took my two 60 +lb dogs over three hours to finish! My dogs are not very destructive to rubber like toys so no issues with chewing through the ball. Only reason for the four stars is because sometimes the treats can be really difficult to get into the Everlasting treatball. Overall, defiantly helps with the dogs cabin fever when it is just to cold to get them out for a walk."
8324,Simple Solution Washable Diapers,0/0,3.0,"did not match up to the sizing guide on back of product. good price and good product in all. I did return the product, didn't appreicayte the inconvenice."
8325,It's Bunco Time Collector's Tin,0/0,3.0,"Things in this case are okay, I feel that the bell is not large enough, the Bunco dice that you throw around the room to whom ever buncos needs to be larger. and the printing on the score sheets need to be larger along with more of them."
8326,Skill Drill Flash Cards,0/0,5.0,Using the cards as a gift and don't know if it will work great. But I have faith that they will love it.

8328,NOW Foods Omega-3 1000mg,0/0,5.0,"These are reasonably priced, and I almost never get the fish burps from them. They also have more Omega 3's than other fish oils in this price range."
8329,Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light,0/0,5.0,"I have had my eye on this turtle since I found out I was pregnant. Now my son is two and I finally bought it for his birthday. His reaction has been amazing. He adores this turtle. He carries it around daily and sits in our long hallway with it on, star-gazing. At bedtime, he cannot wait to turn out the light and see the moon and stars appear on his ceiling. While he's always been good at bedtime, now he actually asks to go.As other reviewers have mentioned, the green light is really the only one that shows up clearly. The blue is a little too dark to show up, and we have a hard time seeing the orange light at all. The hard plastic shell feels a little more fragile than I would have expected for the price, although it has certainly shown no sign of wear, having been dropped many times.The most important thing about this turtle is my son's response, and I could not have asked for a better one."
8330,McDavid Deluxe Knee/Elbow Pad,0/0,5.0,I love the back strap. Regular knee pads are hot and uncomfortable after you use these. I keep two extra pair just in case I lose one!
8331,F.A.S.T. Nisim FAST Shampoo & Conditioner 12 oz. each For FAST Hair Growth!,1/1,1.0,"I was really excited to try this product, after many years of looking for things to help with my hair growth. I first bought it because all of the wonderful reviews, i went through two bottles thinking that it needed more time and to be honest i feel like my hair hasnt grown at all, if anything I feel like I'm losing some hair now that im on my second bottle. This product doesnt work for everyone I guess. Good luck people."
8332,Angel Cream for Women by Thierry Mugler,1/1,5.0,"So dissapointed-- Did NOT receive product displayed. Received a different Thierry Product in its place, which has since been returned. I am in love with the original angel product. This scent is quite addictive and truly one of a kind. Now, if I could just recieve what I ordered-- I would be so happy!"
8333,Crazy Rolls Bubble Gum,0/0,2.0,When I ordered this item the pictures made it look like it is the size of bubble tape. It doesnt have anything on the ad to tell you different. I got them for a school project that needed to be a certain size circle and was extremely bugged that they are soooooo tiny. ONLY 0.56oz rolls. The gum taste good but you get lots less gum than expected.
8334,Cloud b Sound Machine Soother,0/0,5.0,"We love him!! He is cuddly and my lo loves him as do my husband and I....great item for baby,,,,"
8335,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,"This product works very well. It is easy to use and has a wide range of selections for pressure of the water. Also, it comes with 5 or 6 attachments for various uses from crowns or bridges to braces."
8336,"NeilMed Sinus Rinse, Premixed 50 Sachets",0/0,5.0,So I have had issues breathing through my nose for a long time. It started to get worse recently and so I figured you know what I am going to try something and came across this! I am SO THANKFUL!! Never have I breathed so well in my life!! It cleared out my sinuses even after just one use! Its amazing and I will forever buy this! Very easy to use and doesnt burn or sting at all. I like this bottle vs the pot thing.

8337,Cake Eyeliner from Fran Wilson,0/0,4.0,"but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner for(NOT the creamy cake liner, just the regular stuff, the creamy is awful)...but it'll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La Femme.This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this. I don't notice any smudging, which is the wonderful thing about a good cake liner, if you apply it wet over some sort of primer or powdered base, then let it dry, maybe add a little sealant (or a spray of mac fix+, urban decay or skindinavia setting sprays, whatever your fancy)it's going to stay quite well for you.You can take this BOLD-which I prefer with a nice 60's flick at the edge-or you can take this natural, or smudgy...all depending on how much water you add, the brush you use.The la femme pots used nearly daily last me around 8 months or more I'd say...I'm assuming the Franny Wilson liner will be about the same.I did notice some strange slight silver sparkle when I held the liner up to the light..but I don't see it on my eye at ALL, so I don't really care.I'm happy so far...will update if my opinion changes."

8340,Powerstep Pinnacle Insole,0/0,2.0,"The inserts were as described, and are quite comfortable, but they are not durable. The blue covering fabric started to separate from the base almost immediately and after only a few months of occasional use, the fabric bunches uncomfortably under my heel. I had been looking for a less expensive alternative to the Lynco inserts, which cost 2 or 3 times as much. But I still have Lynco inserts which have been heavily used for 3 or more years and they are worn, but still very serviceable. I tossed the Powersteps and purchased more of the Lyncos--better value in the long run."
8341,Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic,0/0,5.0,"This coconut oil is so Great! Everything you want...product of the Philippines, Organic and Cold Pressed!! Next time I'm ordering a bigger jar!"
8342,Merkur Classic Safety Razor with Open Tooth Comb,0/0,5.0,"I was getting tired of buying razor cartridges and had heard high praise for the simpler safety razors from others and thought I would give it a try. This one has a nice weight to it and is easy to change out the razor blade when it gets dull. The handle is shorter than most modern razors, but I find that it actually makes it easier to use. I very much like this razor and will never go back to Gillette--this razor gave me the closest shave I've ever experienced."

8346,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/0,4.0,"Tim Burton has been recognized already for years to be a master of black comedies with fantastical and weird elements. Beetlejuice is brightly colored early gem in that collection that has been bit forgotten behind darker, later masterpieces. The story itself is however very &#34;Burtonesque&#34; and feels to be close relative of Edward Scissorhands that has similarly abstract, colorful imagery and bit sad undertones behind otherwise brightly colored fantasy world.Here we have Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin as newly-deceased lovely, naive couple who want to get rid of family that has settled in their old house - and their desperate attempts lead them to bio-exorcist Betelgeuze, who of course almost manages to wreck everything before bright, happy ending. The whole cast from happy couple to Michael Keaton's demented Betelgeuze to Winona Ryder's goth girl and annoyingly preppy Catherine O'hara seem bit unlikely selections in their roles but that makes them even more charming and fun. And the score of Danny Elfman fits the picture well together with sunny tunes of Harry Belafonte.It is rumoured that there will be sequel for Beetlejuice but I am not sure whether that is a good idea... maybe he should be left to wait in Underworld with his shrunken head and hope that nobody calls his name three times..."
8347,"3M Littmann Lightweight II S.E. Stethoscope, Burgundy Tube, 28 inch, 2451",0/0,4.0,"This scope has been great for me in nursing school. However once I graduate I plan to upgrade. It is definitely lightweight. I just love the color. For the money it's so cheap and really good. Do not buy a ten dollar scope, you will not be able to hear things correctly. Perfect for a nursing student!!"
8348,Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Lotion 10 percent Glycolic AHA -- 6 fl oz,0/0,5.0,This is great for dry skin or a dry patch. It is very soothing once it dries. I used it at a friend house and ordered it from Amazon. It works great on your feet also! Nice price also! Much more expensive in drug store..
8349,"Genisoy Soy Crisps, Creamy Ranch, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,"I like soy crisps because they're a great crunchy snack that packs protein for not a lot of calories. These, though, are not my favorite GeniSoy flavor -- I'm a bigger fan of the Deep Sea Salt flavor.But, I'll buy these if the store is out of the salt ones -- these used to be my favorite flavor until they redid the flavoring. I find the new ranch to be too salty -- be warned, it's strong.They still have a good creamy flavor, I just dust off some of the flavoring on them."
8350,Take-A-Part Vehicle Building Toy Set,0/0,5.0,Purchased for our grandsons 3rd birthday. He absolutely loved not just the plane but the time spent with his dad to put it together. It remains one of his very favorite toys and spends as much time on the &#34;workbench&#34; as flying. Perfect gift for any little fella.

8352,Verilux HappyLite Deluxe Sunshine Simulator,0/0,5.0,"I have experienced mild depression every winter for as long as I can remember. It was worse the farther north I lived, the worst being inSeattle and Nantes, France. I have been using the Verilux HappyLight Delux for two months now and can say that it completely eliminated the depression. It sits on a table next to my chair to the side and slightly in front of me. I use it for 30-60 minutes a day. The first day I used it, My wife noted that I was laughing out loud at the morning comics! I highly recommend this product."

8358,SmartCat Bootsie's Combination Scratcher,0/0,4.0,"My cat loves it an its he go-to scratching post now instead of the arms of my couch! I put it on the floor and showed him what to do... he took to it right away. He is a larger cat and it is big enough for him to stand on and really tug.It has lasted a fair amount of time. I think I am certainly getting my money's worth compared to the old cardboard scratchers. The fabric is beginning to pull from the edge, but I am happy with it. I would have liked it to be a bit wider so he could lay on it more easily like he did the wide cardboard scratchers."
8359,"Black, White & Red Infant Stimulation TOY TRIO",0/0,5.0,"I was amazed that my newborn started tracking the black, white and red patterns at just days old. He loves to look at them when he is calm and awake.The rattles are louder than some other wrist toys, so they get his attention quickly. If he is fussy, they do tend to add to his stress, but when he is ready to play, he seems to really enjoy them."
8360,Melissa & Doug Flower Power Wooden Bead Set,0/0,4.0,"So appropriate and fun for the intended recipient (just turned 4 years old) that the 6 year old sister uses it just as much! They have a blast with this. The beads and strings are a lot of fun for them. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the box. This is not user friendly for a 4-5 year old. Too much focus on &#34;form&#34; over &#34;function&#34;. The display box looks good, but was hard to use."
8361,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"I love the subdued sparkle that this gives my fingers or toes, it really looks like you'd imagine Dorothy's &#34;Ruby Pumps&#34; would look like. A bit difficult to get off as any &#34;glitter nail polish&#34; but not as bad as some. Stays on (at least my toes) remarkably well."
8362,Colora Henna Creme Black 2 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I use this product with hot black coffee. The result is a rich black color which revives the color of my hair and gives me a few tears back. As the henna fades, there is not an overwhelming violet hue, it is more subtle."
8363,"Drawstring Yard Bag, Clear 39 Gal",0/0,4.0,Great Bags! They were large enough to fit alot of leaves/yard debris in and were fairly tough to rip. If you get a sharp branch or something they will rip through but how many bags out there wont? Good bags overall

8365,Zoya Nail Polish,0/1,1.0,"As I mentioned with the other Zoya color, Regean, this color is nice, but it's not OPI! They lack shine and consistency. The product started out okay, but I found that the more I exposed the brush to the air, the polish started to thicken and clump. It's added to the polish trash pile!"

8369,Navitas Naturals Maca Powder,0/0,4.0,"I'm sold on maca powder, but I know the taste is a little hard to handle. Best way to take it (in my experience) is in a glass of unsweetened almond milk with some cinnamon mixed in. Something about the cinnamon minimizes the weird maca taste."

But when I discontinued, it stopped. Then Ithought maybe I should try just one more pill and sure enough! PAIN! GAG! HORROR!DO NOT buy this stuff!!If you do, don't say I didn't warn you!!I now take bifidis and lactobaccillus and all is well!"
8371,Singer Knitting Machine,1/1,4.0,"Wow! So many bad reviews.I haven't read them all, but the ones I've read made me think.I purchased this exact machine at Walmart for $15 on clearance (got 3 of 'em).I'm a guy and I don't knit, crochet or anything like that.I purchased it to help my daughter increase her production of things that she sells on line.So I bought it with the mindset that I would have to take some time and really try to get this thing to work consistently so I could show her how I set it up and was productive with it.I didn't really read the instructions and I couldn't figure out how the tensioner really worked so I improvised. Had some problems starting out.Turned out to be tension problems.Every problem I've had with this machine is related to tension.You MUST MUST MUST use enough tension for the yarn you are using, but not too much to jam the machine.The instructions seem to a$$ backwards.Not enough tension seems to be causing all the problems they listed.If the needle is splitting the yarn, you don't have enough tension.If you are getting bunches of yarn stuck on a needle or needles, you don't have enough tension.If, when a needle is rising, there is thread on the top of the needle and making it difficult to turn the knob or jamming, you don't have enough tension.If you have so much tension that it's hard to turn the wheel and you are still having problems, you can't use that yarn in this machine.When I first got the machine, I tried the pink and blue eyelash yarn that comes with the machine. What a mess that was.It took me forever to get the yarn off the needles and to pull it all out again.So, I messed with some other yarn (Red heart and some other value yarn from Walmart) and took my time carefully watching what was happening with the needles.This is when I finally figured out how important the tension was.I pulled all the yarn from the ball or skein and put it in a box on the floor, draped the yarn around my back and over my shoulder and through one of the holes in the tensioner and then kept tension on the line by pulling the loose end through the machine and holding it with one hand and turning the crank with the other and leaning forward or backward to keep it tight.I made sure I had two full lines before I went into automatic.So, start slow and make sure your tension is pretty tight.The tension did make the crank a bit hard to turn, but it didn't protest like when it jams.With the proper tension, you can go as fast as you want and I have.Remember the eyelash yarn I talked about. What mess it was? After I got the tension figured out, it actually ran better than regular yarn it looks fantastic.The only problem I see is that it takes some effort cranking this thing and even when everything is working perfectly it will still drop a stitch every once in a while.Now with all this said, I'm only making tubes, flat pieces seem to much more difficult and I haven't tried using the tensioner the way it was designed, but I will be attempting that soon."
8372,North American Healthcare TV3649 Wristech Blood Pressure Monitor,0/0,3.0,"my blood pressure has been erratic, so my Dr suggested I get a BP wrist cuff. There are so many to choose from, so I just ordered one. I've been having a visiting nurse for another issue, but she and I have compared my BP with her manual arm wrap vs my wrist cuff. This morning immediately following her reading I used the wrist cuff. The systolic was 17 points higher than her reading and the diastolic was 13 points higher. That's a big difference. I have been writing down which method has been used and made a list for my Dr to interpret, even given the difference in readings. I gave it a rating of 3 because I guess it's better than not being able to measure my BP at all, so I'm grateful to have it."

It's well made, looks nice, and very easy to put together.I had a few issues with it that had nothing to do with craftsmanship.My Yorkie puppy is a chewer and a climber.The pen is very short, my puppy jumped out the first day I put him in it.He also tried to chew on the plastic.If you have a small, well-mannered little pet, it's perfect.My little guy is just learning his manners so it did not work for us."

8378,Citrus Magic Air Freshner Orange,1/1,5.0,"I love this product. It is very strong and smells exactly like fresh oranges. I use it to freshen my main rooms before anyone visits. With dogs, I'm always weary of bad smells, so this does the trick. Its price is rather high, but it's concentrated and lasts a long time. I've tried other room and furnature deoderizers (whatever is popular at the time), but I always come back to this. It's wonderful."

In case it went bad, I ordered both battery and transformer. However, the smell went away once the battery was placed, and transformer cools down quite a bit. Obviously a bad battery with 10+ years need to be replace to reduce fire hazard.There are actually cheaper ones with same part number and size. I selected this one just because it looks better."

8384,"Black Currant, Loose Tea and Teabags",0/0,1.0,"I was shocked when I opened the airtight bag and smelled $30 worth of supposedly black currant tea. Nowhere to be found was the pleasing aroma of black currants. Instead, this tea smells like raisins and, when I picked through the tea leaves, I found whole, soft, shriveled raisins, which don't remotely resemble black currants in any way. In fact, there is something called a ""zante currant"" (which is a misnomer) that is really a raisin made from Black Corinth grapes, which are a sweet, seedless table grape. Why anyone would want this in black tea leaves is beyond me. True black currants are a type of berry have a delicious fragrance and are quite tart. In form, they resemble blueberries, but they are a dark purplish-black color. There is another brand of black currant black tea leaves (Peet's) that comes in a tin and is the real thing. It is black tea leaves with bits of dried black currants and it has the genuine aroma of black currants with a delightful tart overtone when you drink it. I can't image what Harney & Sons was thinking when they came up with this blend and called it ""Black Currant,"" but I won't be buying their pricey tea again in any flavor. (I still have a tin of their ""English Breakfast"" that I bought years ago and paid a lot for, only to find that it is redolent of cinnamon, which is not a flavor I want in English breakfast tea.)Anyway, if you like a sweet tea with the overpowering aroma and flavor of raisins, you'll love this tea. But if it's black currant tea you want, well, this is not."

8396,Gourmet Pet Feeder,0/0,5.0,"I thought that the big clear plastic storage bin would be difficult to manage, but it is not. It is locked into the base. You add the kibble by taking the lid off of the top and pouring it in. The opening is more than wide enough to pour straight from the bag. I put a full 10 pounds of cat food in the container. The little kitten has no problems eating from it and the food falls right down to refill it. Excellent solution."
8397,"Casabella Premium Water Stop Gloves, Small 1pr",0/0,3.0,"I got these a year ago, due to the positive review and affordability. After 7 months, I noticed a tiny tear in the right glove, at the bottom between my middle and ring finger. It wasn't so bad at first; it got a little humid, but not moldy or stinky. After another month though, it got pretty gross, until finally tonight I threw it away. I REALLY loved them while the right glove lasted, but finding out from another reviewer that their glove tore easily (within couple of months!) I don't think I'll be getting these again. Yes cheap, but I'd rather spend a little more to have a pair that lasts over a year."

We have tried everything you can buy from Wal-Mart and Superpets, tried Dynovite, spent hundreds of dollars on anyhting new, and NOTHING has worked. Also, this last year we have had a bad flea problem, and none of the flea killers we usually used have worked. It was so bad the thought even crossed my mind that if this keeps up I may have to put Chase to sleep, he was that miserable. I ordered this product and I can say I am ASHAMED at how many flees this shampoo killed :( It has a great smell, and literally ten minutes after we used it his skin changed. His fur was SOFT and his skin was moist like it use to be, its literally a miracle in a bottle. He slept better that night than he has in months and his fur started growing back! I am hooked on this shampoo for life, and I want to thank the other Amazon reviewers for recommending this product, you probably saved my dogs life!"

8406,Innotek Lap Dog Trainer,0/0,1.0,"I bought two of these for our two miniature pinschers they have short hair and are very small (about 5-7 lbs) I read that this is the one and only for toy breeds. One of the collars did not work even after replacing the batteries. The other collar we used the ""1"" setting which is the lightest setting and it made our dog yelp so loud and jump like it hurt so bad. Our dog was shaking and hid under our foot stool and was traumatized. This is not in his nature to be a wussy, min pins are considered tough and the ""King of Toy"" breeds. In the instructions it said a response like that means the setting is too high and may be harmful. The training DVD was not helpful it was based on a different larger product with different controls and for large breeds. This product is too powerful for dogs so tiny. Oh and even though its small the shock device was still so big that my dog could not look down because it took up his whole front of his neck."

8409,Atomic Fireballs 5 lb Party Fiesta Pack,0/0,3.0,"the listing indicated that they were &#34;small.&#34; they were extra large. just as tasty, but they have almost double the calories"
8410,"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory",0/0,5.0,I bought this for my wife at the start of her second trimester. She was having back problems and waking up in the middle of the night a lot. Now she can't sleep without it. We went on vacation and she had to shape the hotel pillows around her body to mimic the Snoogle. When we got back home she couldn't wait to sleep with the Snoogle again. The only bad thing about it is the pillow case is very hard to remove and even harder to put back on.
8411,Foot Repair Cream Practitioners Strength Foot Miracle,0/0,5.0,I use this morning and night on my feet to minimize callous buildup. Third bottle. I recommend. Only negative is that the plunger dispenser stops working when less than an inch of cream is left. I just open the top to scoop out
8412,Ticket To Ride - Europe,0/0,5.0,"This Ticket to Ride game is a little more exciting than the original (USA) board. In this game for 2-5, you connect cities by building train routes. You can build tunnels, ferries, and train stations and can block your opponent. Finish a route, and get points added to your total. Fail to finish a route, lose points. Great family game for about 8 years and up."
8413,INTENSIVE CONCENTRATE FOR EXISTING STRETCH MARKS By STRIVECTIN,0/0,5.0,"I have used this on and off with little results because I never stuck with it. Finally I decided to give it a real test before tossing the 1/4 used bottle (which was expensive, large and takes up a lot of space). I'm so glad I didn't throw it away! I tested it by rubbing a small amount on my left hand, twice a day. I didn't do anything to my right hand. I am Asian, 52 years old and have always had decent skin, but I really noticed thinning of my face and hand skin after turning 49. I don't know exactly how long it took (at least 4 weeks, maybe even up to 2 months; wish I would have written down when I started), but suddenly I noticed that the left hand was noticeably smoother, the wrinkles were finer and the skin felt thicker, even on the knuckles (I didn't put any on my fingers). I never saw this type of result on my face but it was extremely easy to see on the hand because I could hold it up next to the right hand, which still has lots of wrinkles and feels paper thin. If you already bought a tube and have been dissatisfied, try my experiment before you give up! I've started using the cream on my face again, twice a day in the hopes of smoothing out some wrinkles and fading age spots. It's only been two weeks and I haven't seen any results yet, but this time I'm going to stick with a lot longer. My tube has cream (actually more of a lotion consistency) that is slightly tan colored and minty smelling. I can't use it too close to the eye because it makes my eyes water. Good luck."
8414,Vitabath Spa Skin Therapy Moisturizing Bath & Shower Gelee (select option/size),0/0,5.0,Great product for shower and lasts long at our beach house. Fragrance lingers and leaves skin soft. I would recomment to anyone
8415,Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,0/2,1.0,"I bought this product based on the good reviews. However, it just died after only 3 months of infrequent use. I changed the batteries and it didn't work, it's dead. What a waste of money. It also didn't trim completely bare, however it was better than a manual razor as I didn't get those awful red bumps afterwards. But the attachment doesn't even work, I had to take it off whenever I used it as otherwise it didn't get any hairs, and then it would just scratch my skin while it shaved. Avoid!"
8416,"CaribSea Eco-Complete 20-Pound Planted Aquarium, Black",0/0,4.0,"Like the title but is comes very close... the two downsides are that the 20 pounds counts the water weight since it comes pre-cycled and its not all black substate. If your okay with this, then this is for you!!!"
8417,Savory Prime 2-Pound Rawhide Chips,0/0,3.0,I stopped giving the rawhide chips to my dogs because they just didn't digest them as they should. We had one pet that had problems with his stomach and spent a couple days in the vet hospital. We didn't know for sure if the rawhide chips were the culprit but decided to stop giving them to our dogs anyway. The dogs did enjoy chewing on them so I was sorry to have to stop but there are other products that are healthier and better for the pets than rawhide.
8418,"Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie Chocolate Chunk, Vegan, 3-Ounce Individually Wrapped Cookies (Pack of 12)",0/0,4.0,My husband likes these for snacks and a breakfast on the good but we finally saw the fine print that they should be refrigerated to keep fresh. He has some that developed mold and we had to toss them out. Now we freeze them and they are thawed by the time he gets to work.
8419,"Finish Powerball Tablets, Orange Scent",0/0,5.0,I knew i was gonna love this I ordered a sample awhile back and I just had to have more this clean my dishes with a nice orangey scent.

8421,Philips Norelco HQ6 Replacement Head,0/0,5.0,Excellent they really work. I had a hard time finding them and thought I was going to have to buy a new shaver. I have already recommended this site to others.
8422,"Stila Lip Glaze, 0.04 Ounce",0/0,5.0,Love the Stila brand & this color is fantastic! Doesn't try out ur lips & there is minimal flavor (which is great)
8423,Chuckit! Classic 26M Launcher (Colors Vary),0/0,5.0,"This is great for playing fetch without having to touch drooly, dirty balls. Plus, I can launch the balls extra far and tire out my pup more quickly!"
8424,Zippo Lighter Fluid 12OZ.,0/2,2.0,"It should let me open without any tools. Plus, there are no instructions for opening. The fuel works, of course."
8425,NeoCutis Bio-Cream - Bio-Restorative Skin Cream with PSP,0/0,5.0,"I am in my mid-forties and live in an extremely dry climate. This product moisturizes very well without feeling greasy. My skin is soft and looks more supple since I've been using it (about 3 months). It is the only product that I have found that makes my hormone-induced malasma nearly disappear for most of the day. As long as I keep using the product, it stays VERY faint."
8426,"Purina One Cat Smartblend Salmon and Tuna Cat Food, 16-Pound",0/0,5.0,"My cats have loved this Purina One for over a year now, they will stare at a half full bowl as if to say &#34;Why isn't this full?&#34;However, don't leave your garage door open in Gold Canyon, Arizona when Amazon just delivered a full 16lb bag. The Javelinas (wild pigs) like this better than the cats! They show their gratitude by distributing it all over the garage, down the driveway and into the street, where I found the empty bag!"
8427,"BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Systems BeasyGlyder 32"" Transfer Board",0/0,5.0,"excellent product, just need to be sure that you transfer at the same height from point A to point B."
8428,"Mabis Dmi Healthcare Combination Douche and Enemasystem with Water Bottle, Red, One",0/0,1.0,I bought this product to help improve my health only to end up with something totally useless unless you count the water bag by itself. The cap seems to be the wrong size and fit for the hot water bag and easily fall outs every time I try to use it.
8429,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"We have two large dogs&#8212;120 and 140 pounds. Finding quality nail trimmers big enough, solid enough, and sharp enough is difficult. These work great. I highly recommend."
8430,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,We ordered the 30-19-21 for our standard dachshund. Its the perfect size for him. He can stretch out his long body and move around with ease. Well made and easy to fold and take on trips. Great price! Way cheaper then in stores and quick to arrive.
8431,Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,0/0,5.0,the product arrived in perfect conditions. it took the necessary time to get to my address. there was no need to contact the sender. i am really satisfied with this purchase.
8432,Revlon Frost & Glow Highlighting Kit 1 ea,2/2,4.0,I have been highlighting my hair off and on for almost 18 years. Going to a professional stylist every month can get pretty expensive. If my budget is to tight or I don't have time to go to a salon I always use Revlon's frost and glow. It's super easy to use! My husband actually pulls my hair through the cap and I apply the bleach. I have tried numerous kits and this one is the best by far! Color always comes out beautiful and does not dry my hair as much as other products. I highly recommend this highlighting kit!
8433,"KONG Extreme Dog Toy, Black",0/0,5.0,"So far so good. My 70 plus lab/pit bull mix 13 month old big babies love this so far. I watched my boy chew it for about ten minutes and it doesn't even have a tooth mark. I am going to look into getting some treat fillers to go inside to keep their attention. So far a win for us, but only time will tell."
8434,"Metro Air Force Steel Commander Durable 2-Speed Dog Dryer, 23000-Feet/mins",0/0,5.0,"I looked at allot of dryers before I got this one. I worried that they would not dry my big 160 pound Newfoundland properly. But wow am I impressed, it dries him right up. I can use it after a bath for him or when we come in out of the rain. I live in the Pacific NW and we get allot of rain so I will get allot of use out of this. It works great!!"
8435,Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet,0/0,5.0,"I only have one daughter and her family lives in Kentucky, so when they came to visit I had to make sure my grandson had a little place to sleep. This Pack n Play was perfect for him to sleep in while they were here. The price was perfect and the quality is excellent. Very happy with this purchase."
8436,Electronic Chime Alarm Clock,0/0,2.0,"Technically this clock works, and the chime does work. It is a cheap little thing (obviously at the price) and is difficult to program. If you ever lose the manual, good luck. Although it works as advertised, I would buy something of better quality next time."
8437,Instant Heat Curling Iron,0/0,5.0,"There's nothing like a Conair Curling Iron! I love the instant heat feature. It gets good and hot, not mediocre. It shuts off automatically for those people who tend to forget that they left their iron on (I'm not one of them but I still appreciate this feature). The variable settings are a nice feature to have as well!"
8438,"Pain Is Good, Batch #37 Hot Sauce, 6.7 fl oz",0/0,4.0,Good hot sauce if you like super hot burn your mouth heat. I was not a fan of the large amount of garlic flavor which you can see tons of minced garlic pieces in the sauce.
8439,"Garden of Life - Olde World Icelandic Cod Liver Oil Lemon mint flavour, 8 fl oz liquid",0/0,5.0,"Who knew Cod Liver Oil would be so easy to take? This is the first bottle of cod liver oil I ever purchased and, so far, the benefits for me include"
8440,"Revlon RV2641 Soft Touch Porcupine Cushion Brush, Colors May Vary",0/0,4.0,Soft bristles and close together; doesn't scratch the scalp or leave markson my thinning scalp.Good every day brush.It is my second purchase of this brush so I would recommend it.
8441,Cat Mate Electromagnetic Cat Flap White,1/1,5.0,"Cat Mate Cat Flap is a great product for the price. Gives your cat the freedom to come and go, but lets me lock it when I don't want her outside; at night, to cold, to windy, etc. I have had mine for 9 years and just installed the same one for friends. Doing an exterior wall installation is more measuring and time consuming as installing in a 1 and a 1/2&#34; door but very worth it. An independent cat is a happy cat!!!"
8442,NOW Foods Lavender Oil,0/1,4.0,This has a nice and mild scent to it. I gave it a four star because it was so expensive... not sure if I needed or would ever use up the 16oz. But for sure I won't purchase again.
8443,Life Extension Vitamin B3 Niacin,0/0,3.0,"I could not control the flushing and hot flashes. not really this particular product's fault, just me I guess. Doctor gave me a prescription for niaspan 500 which I was somewhat able to tolerate but for its cost I'm going back to my generic pravastatin for $10 for 90. I wish I had been able to tolerate this."
8444,Emerita (Pro-Gest) Pro-gest Cream,0/0,5.0,"My wife swears by this product. Her understanding is that it is far safer that hormone replacement therapy. Mostly it just plain works, this is not a fake homeopathic product, it really does assist with hormone balance.For me, besides a happy wife, I love the price!"
8445,Andis 21420 Pro-Animal Detachable Ceramic Blade Clipper Kit,0/0,4.0,"After buying the cheaper dog clippers ($30 or so), I finally moved up to a better one. The Andis is far better than most you will buy at Walmart or other stores. The only problem this clipper has is with heavy matted hair. It will cut through some matted hair but not the real bad stubborn ones too well. Other than that, it cuts much faster than any other clipper I have had so far.Pros - Cuts fast, does not bog down, does not get too hot, stays sharp, easy to handle, light weight, long cord and has a carrying case.Cons - Will cut but with some difficulty on heavy matted dog hair."
8446,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"We used these for our older son and our now using them again. We feel like they have less of a &#34;pee&#34; smell than some of the other brands. (Sorry that is gross, but there is no other way to say it!) Good absorbency, soft, reliable."
8447,"FootSmart Posture Corrective Heel Cup, Pair",0/0,5.0,"Altho there are cheaper ones in other catalogs, these are worth the cost. My husband got a second pair to use in another pair of shoes. The first heel cups were purchased a couple of years ago and they are still in great condition."
8448,"The First Years 6 Pack Take & Toss Bowls with Lids, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"This is the second set of these bowls I've bought because this size is so perfect for leftovers in our house, snacks and lunches for my 3 year old. The lids are secure, leaking never happens and you can easily write names on them."

8452,Dana English Leather Cologne,0/0,4.0,"Every Christmas I buy my son-in-love some kind of cologne. I love the smell of English Leather, so this year this is what he received. He likes it, too."
8453,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,3.0,"I purchased Zoya polishes in two shades, Tart (blue) and Lana (pinkish orange-red), and have had to repolish multiple times over the last three weeks. The colors are beautiful; they catch light very easily, which adds just a hint of sparkle. But without a base coat, they go on thin and streaky, requiring 2-3 coats for solid, non-transparent color. I've also had problems getting the layers to dry; even waiting 10-15 minutes between coats doesn't keep the polish from scratching easily even 24hrs later (it doesn't chip, it slides off). I added a base coat and a hardening top coat, which cut down on the need for multiple coats for full coverage, but as I'm a rather impatient girl, I haven't found the magic time length that will make these polishes set. For comparison sake, I usually use OPI, Essie, or L'Or&#279;al polishes, and while they sometimes chip, I've never had the same issues with drying time or polish smudging."
8454,Melissa & Doug Princess Puppet,0/0,5.0,This puppet was a HUGE hit with my granddaughter. She is adorable! (the puppet and the little girl who got her!)
8455,Mill Creek Biotin Conditioner -- 16 fl oz,0/0,4.0,I like this product a lot. the conditioner doesn't weigh your hair down like most of the conditioners out there.
8456,Zimbbos,0/0,5.0,My grandkids and their parents love this game. Everyone can play! Sturdy box makes a good playing surface as well as great storage. Thanks for making this gift available thru Amazon.
8457,"OXO Good Grips Soap Dispensing Dish Sponge Refills, 2-Pack",0/0,3.0,"I really like the Good Grips Soap Dispenser, and these sponges work well fresh out of the package. The only disappointing thing is that they wear out fast. Mine wore out in less than month."
8458,Baby Sherpa Diaper Backpack - Black,0/0,5.0,"Purchased this bag because we needed something with an insulated area for lunches/snacks. This one is great. The insulated area on the bottom is very roomy. The insulated holder on the side easily holds a sippy cup, juice box, or small bottle. It has tons of pockets and storage. Perhaps one of the best things about this bag is that the straps are comfortable for wearing for long periods of time. Great for travel or just for a trip to the mall."
8459,Pureology Hydrate Condition,0/0,5.0,"OMG, I have been trying and trying different conditioners for dry hair for years. I have always stayed away from this product as I don`t really like minty smells. However after hearing so many good things about it, I got the small (sample size) and tried it. I couldn`t believe how this product INSTANTY helped my hair!!! Seriously, sooo much moisture, without weighing my very fine hair down. The mint smell yes was shocking and it does stimulates your scalp and that was strange first, but now I have the big bottles and I am kinda used to all that. The results are fantastic and ths is my all time favorite moisturizing conditioner!!!(Also, for shampoo, I got the Pureology Perfect4Platinum shampoo, and together they work like a dream!) :-))) 10 stars, I hope they never discontiue these products or change them..."
8460,Crayola Color Wonder,0/0,5.0,This color wonder stuff is brilliant and super for travel on an airplane and to friend's homes without worrying that your child will color all over everything.
8461,Philips Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads,0/0,5.0,I have always enjoyed Norelco products. These replacement blades are great. They offer a very close shave and do not cause irritation.
8462,Geoffrey Beene Grey Flannel Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,I found grey flannel when I was a much younger man. The mixture of fragrances suits me well and I've received many complements through the years. Why mess with success?
8463,Diva Cup Diva Cup #1 Pre Childbirth,1/1,1.0,"I love the idea. And it definitely keeps the flow in check. Not sure about they suggested time. Probably depends on your flow. But, boy, is it hard to get in and out. Really hard to get it in the right place and then get it to release the suction and get it out again. It's very messy! And a bit painful. I read a lot of different reviews. And apparently, some people love them (if you can trust the reviews) and other people not so much. I don't think it's for me."
8464,"Luna Bars, 1.69-Ounce Bars",0/0,5.0,"I have one of these EVERY DAY at breakfast. They are the best tasting and I love the nutrition they provide, including Folic Acid"
8465,Rayovac A1604-8PP Alkaline 9-Volt Batteries (Eight-pack),1/1,1.0,"within minutes of installing it in my smoke alarm, it already started beeping and alerting me that the battery was low"
8466,Lentek Bark Free PRO Series,0/0,3.0,After installing this product I noticed that the dogs will start barking but will not keep at it near as long. It seems to provide some control up to a radius of thirty feet.
8467,Fisher-Price Bright Beginnings Stacking Action Blocks,0/0,5.0,"We played with these at a friend's house when our son was about 10 months old. He really enjoyed playing with them then. We bought him his own set for his first birthday. He played with them for a little while, but now, at 18 months, never pulls them out to play with them anymore. We should've gotten them when he was about 6 months old or so."
8468,Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,0/0,3.0,"This works great as a ladies personal trimmer, no nicks, good speed and easy to use, but it really didn't trim as close as I was hoping. I will continue to use it but it will have to be more often."
8469,OPI Katy Perry Collection Nail Lacquer,0/0,5.0,One of my favorite polishes! Too bad it was a limited special edition. They should make it a part of their permanent polishes.
8470,"PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System, PIF-300",2/2,5.0,I have two of these. my dog has done great with this system. I was frustrated initially but it takes patience and training with the white flags- WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR DOGS
8471,Nature's Way Pau D'Arco,0/0,5.0,"I had terrible Candida after being on long-term antibiotics for Lyme. I used this product to fight the Candida, as well as colostrum, oregano oil, and Biokult probiotics.Somehow Nature's Way herbs work really well. Don't know why."

8473,K&H Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed,0/0,5.0,What could be better for cold nights than a heated pad? I feel better knowing that my outdoor cats are comfortable. I would certainly buy this pad again and highly recommend it!
8474,Mueller Hg80 Hinged Knee Brace,0/0,2.0,"The hinges work great but the elastic and nylon/neoprene material is not thick or long lasting. After 2 weeks usage, I am unable to get a firm hold with the velcro fasteners due to stretching of the material shell. The brace slips down from the intended position and becomes more of a hassle than a support. I am 6'3, 240 lbs. and bought the large size according to the sizing chart. I feel that a small might have been more effective after it stretched so much."
8475,ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water,0/0,4.0,"It is probably just nuts from a different country, but it is just naturally a bit sweet for my taste."
8476,CR-123 Photo Battery 3V Lithium 1 Pack,0/0,5.0,This battery is just right for my Olympus 35mm film camera. It lasts a long time since it's Lithium. Long shelf life

8478,Merrick Turducken Dog Food 5.5 oz (24 Count Case),0/0,5.0,"Merrick has changed to grin free, and has stopped making the 5.5 ounce cans. The product is still good, but I have to add fiber to the food to keep my pup's system working properly. My question,why fix something when it isn't broken?"
8479,"Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment, 1.7 Ounce",0/0,4.0,not too thick or greasy .penetrates into the skin quickly and firms .Does not sting or leave the skin shiny
8480,Iron-Tek Essential Natural 100% Protein,0/0,5.0,"Iron Tek 'vanilla cake' protein supplement is an affordable, versatile protein supplement with a more than decent taste - getting a bump of protein using water is quick and tasty, and when mixed with lean milk it is a great topper for bran flakes for a great snack with complex carbs, lean protein and high fiber.The 'vanilla cake' flavor is good all by itself, but it allows you to add a teaspoon of chocolate or instant coffee for a change of pace.Even though a shake mixer works better than a spoon and cup, the mix is smooth and never gritty.Each spring at the Arnold Expo in Columbus Ohio, I pick up a huge variety of protein supplement samples, but when I have to spend my money on protein, I keep coming back to Iron Tek."
8481,iCell Tech Size 10 Hearing Aid Batteries (60 batteries),0/0,5.0,"sent for repeat orders, they work fine more words are not necessary the first ones said tell the whole story."
8482,Futurebiotics Pressur-Lo,0/0,2.0,"I used it for two weeks and my blood pressure went up!However,I can't blame this OTC product because Rx medications haven't done so well either.In general,I've found Futurebiotics products to be good and effective."
8483,Robanda Anti-Aging Hand Cream 3oz,0/0,5.0,"I am always looking for hand lotion. I like thus one so far. It does not dmell too strongly of medicine or flowers. I took pics of my hands and time will tell if the anti-aging componant works. I will take pics again in a month and see what I think. Otherwise, works well as a mouisturizer. Slightly greasy, but I expected that with these ingredients."
8484,Pour Homme,0/0,1.0,Unfortunately this product arrived & did not smell right. We've had this scent before & know what it's supposed to smell like. The good news is our money was immediately refunded. Thanks!

8486,"Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"This is going to last me forever! You only need a nickel-sized dab to foam up and wash your entire face. It's going to last me several months!!It's nice and doesn't dry out my face too much, and I LOVE the fact that it's a face cleanser and takes off all my makeup at the same time - EVEN my eye makeup! :)"
8487,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,0/1,5.0,"This machine worked just fine for a couple of years. Recently, I've had to take my husband's blood pressure twice a day, so the machine has just &#34;given up&#34;."

8489,"Sonne's Organic Foods - Sonne's No. 7 Detoxification, 32 fl oz liquid",0/0,5.0,Use this all the time. Makes you feel better and gives you more energy. Mainly used sonnies foe drug tests for thc at work. All you need is like 3 hrs and a 1/3 of a bottle. Good to go. Chug it and then drink a couple cups water and pee once before. It's like a science. Then I started to notice it all around made me feel better and alive. So now I just drink it every day. straight from bottle chase with water or cranberry juice.
8490,Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning,0/0,4.0,"My wife bought this to replace her 1875 she's used for years, which was getting ragged from drops on the floor and general use. This is the same model, but does not seem to work as well; she claims it does not get as hot, nor is the fan as powerful as her older one. Apparently Conair has changed something in the design or production over time. It works, but just is not as good as it used to be (jeez, now I sound old! &#34;Back in my day...&#34;)"
8491,Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,Great price. Fresh product. Fast shipping. A nutritious treat for your dog. The mini size is nice to use to reward your dog whether for training well or just to show your love for them. Mini size helps prevent obesity in dogs.
8492,Snuggle Safe Pet Bed Microwave Heating Pad,0/0,4.0,"Purchased this for stray cat that showed up on my doorstep during the cold months of the year. I already had an indoor cat, very much alpha female, and she is very aggresive.- won't allow another cat anywhere near inside the home. I wanted to do the humane thing and attempt to make a refuge for her ourdoors- BUT, how to heat it without harm to the animal or great expense.?I purchsed this item, works well, the cat sleep on it the very first night- simply put a bath towel around the heated disk, and inserted it into a large box, keep her warm quite nicely."
8493,My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover,0/0,5.0,I like this pillow cover better than the original one that my pillow came with. Its really soft and also absorbent for minor spit ups! Fits easily onto pillow
8494,Snap Circuits SC-300,0/0,5.0,"I bought this as a present for my great-nephew. His birthday is 3 days after Christmas. I always have difficulty finding something he might like and does not already have. Well, this year I think I hit a homerun! He was quoted as saying, &#34;This is the best birthday present!&#34; I read the other reviews before I purchased and most were 4 -5 stars. They were right."
8495,Cigarette Shaped Lighter,0/0,1.0,The lighter arrived promptly.Of course it was empty for shipping.I went out and bought butane and the very first time I tried to fill it up it fell apart in my hand.The internal well slipped right out of the sheath when pressing the butane into the fill valve.Then when I tried to put it back the cap mechanism broke apart in my hand.So I didn't use it once before I had to throw it away.Invest in a zippo.
8496,All Natural Vintage Wuyi Oolong (Wu Long) Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Teabags - 7.0 Oz,0/0,5.0,"Wu Long teas is really great, I have a couple cups each morning to start the day. You can pay more other places, but this is good quality at a fair price."
8497,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,"I love my waterpik. It's so easy to use, and the instructions are very clear. It comes with so many tips! I'm excited to use them all."

8499,Aubrey Organics,0/0,5.0,I went through just about everything trying to find SOMETHING for my extremely sensitive and acne prone skin. This is the only thing that I've found that cleans and moisturizers my skin without irritating it! Helped calm my skin.
8500,"Glad SimplyCooking OvenWare 9x12, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,Thsi product is the perfect size for storing or freezing left over food. It provides a tight seal so air cannot get to the food.
8501,"Farmer Brothers Decaf Medium Roast Coffee, 2 lb Bag",0/0,5.0,"Like others, I have found this coffee at a family owned restaurant in Quitman, TX. I inquired what kind of coffee this was and they said Farmers...so I went online to see what I could find. I just received my first order this week and enjoyed my first homemade cup...soooo delicious.There is one question I would like to ask though...since the size of the bag is so large...can it be frozen...or just keep it in the frig. I only drink coffee on the weekends.gammababa@sbcglobal.net"
8502,Beautyblender and Blendercleanser Combo,0/0,5.0,I've bought this product for over a year it does what I need it to do it always gives me a flawless look. I will continue to buy this product unless something better comes out :) otherwise I'm sticking to the beauty blender
8503,SOLARAY RED YEAST RICE 600 MG Capsules,0/0,1.0,"I was able to read &#34;the fine print&#34; on the label when the product was delivered. I learned that this product contains small amounts of citrinin and heavy metals, which can cause health problems. I phoned Solaray who verified this. I threw the bottle away.Then I reseached several other brands of Red Yeast Rice and purchased a different brand that is grown in the US (not China where there are less restrictive health and safety regulations) specifically to be free of citrinin and heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, lead, mercury) and has extensive laboratory testing to ensure the product's high quality and safety."
8504,2IN1 LASER PET TOY EXERCISER,0/0,5.0,"We have 6 cats who are spending WAY too much time indoors and getting into trouble during the winter months, so i got these lasers in the hopes i could get them to burn off some of their excess energy -- and boy do these work!!! The cats go crazy chasing the red light around and we're able to get them to spin in circles or even jump up on the wall! And, if one family member is being especially irritating, the laser light might 'accidentally' show up on their leg right before the cat leaps for it ;). Fun for the WHOLE family!!"
8505,"Conair Supreme Triple Curling Iron Pack - 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch and 1 inch",0/0,3.0,THIS ITEM WAS GREAT AT FIRST BUT AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK. HAVE HAD MANY OF THIS ITEM FROM MY BIRTHDAY AND ALL WERE THE SAME. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THEY DONT WORK ANY MORE SORRY TO LET YOU ALL KNOW BUT THERE CRAP BUT IF YOU WANT THEM ENJOY!
8506,Learning Resources Inflatable Solar System Set,0/0,3.0,"I gave this to my six year old grandson who is really into the Solar System. He likes it but he did say to me &#34;The size of the planets is not right. Earth is way smaller than Jupiter and way, way smaller than the Sun, but it doesn't look like that here.&#34; If a six-year-old can determine that the inflatable model is not to scale... So take that part of it with a grain of salt.Another thought is think about where you are going to hang this. My daughter has tall ceilings in her home. For them the display is fine. This is going to be hanging very low in a house with only 8' high ceilings. They also hung them along one wall because the room has a ceiling fan in it that gets used. Other than that, it's cute."
8507,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Alphabet Stamp Set,0/0,5.0,So wonderful that it has both the small and capital letters together. I wish it came with a lid. I found a flat bag to keep it in so that they can all stay together.
8508,"Q-tips Cotton Swabs, 500 Count",0/0,5.0,"nothing to complain about, the price, the quality and the quantity. just buy it, if you need a lot of cotton swabs"
8509,Polly Pocket Case - Colors May Vary,0/0,4.0,"I bought two for my twin nieces to hold their dolls. The quality is fairly nice, the pouch is well constructed and relatively large. My girls love it!"
8510,Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper,0/0,4.0,"I love the quality of this clipper. It cuts cleanly instead of tearing the nail--as the cheaper clippers do these days (they didn't used to...). But I wouldn't call it a toenail clipper. The edge is somewhere between that of a fingernail clipper and a toenail clipper, definitely smaller than what I'm used to."
8511,Terre D'Hermes by Hermes for Men,0/0,4.0,"I usually don't review items I buy here on Amazon or any other place. Now for a cologne that I blindly bought I most say I'm not disappointed at all its not loud nor is sweet, more like a citrus manly note that thanks God my wife love as well."
8512,Acid Soothe,0/0,5.0,"I have grown to love Enzemedica. They really have great products. This is one of the many also Virastop, Digest Gold and Mucostop I would recommend. This one I have been told also helps when you have reflux which I do. I cannot say if it has helped with my refulx or not bc I dont tend to get symptoms with reflux that often but when I do it comes in the form of indigestion and this gets rid of it many times."
8513,Dona Crystalline Glucosamine Sulfate Caplets - 60 Ea,0/0,3.0,"The product was recommended to me by my orthopedic surgeon for my swollen and painful finger joints. I took it regularly over a period of several months. I cannot say that I notice a big difference, perhaps the bouts of stinging pain are a little shorter now, but they are still there. All in all, no big difference."
8514,"Thayer Witch Hazel Toner AF w/Aloe Vera Formula Vitamin E, Lavender 12 oz",0/0,4.0,"I love the scent of this witch hazel, and so far it isn't making my face break out, like witch hazel with alcohol does."
8515,American Crew Fiber,0/0,5.0,I love this Fiber stuff...like the only stuff I'll put in my hair. Came quick and cheap. That's what she said.
8516,"Larabar Fruit and Nut Food Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)",0/0,5.0,I love Larabars as a GF product. I keep one in my purse at all times as an alternative to popcorn at the movies and just for snacking on the go. Great pricing on Amazon.
8517,Bijan Style By Bijan For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 Ounces,0/0,5.0,I've received many compliments when wearing this Bijan Style scent. I only like it but others seem to love it.
8518,Detox Tea - 20 bags,0/0,5.0,"This is a genuinely delicious tea with a nice herbal-sweet flavor. It's must tastier than some of the more prominent, more expensive brands."
8519,Svan Signet Chair Cushion,0/0,5.0,"I love that the cushion is comfortable, easy to clean, and the color is wonderful, and my daughter loves to sit in it. Before we got the cushion she didn't like sitting in the chair at all now that's her favorite seat."
8520,Aubrey Organics,0/0,4.0,"I have stupidly sensitive skin. Because of this, I've found that the more ingredients a product has, the more wary I am about it, simply because I know that SOMETHING is going to bother my skin. Overall, I really like this moisturizer, but it is just a little too busy for my skin. I really recommend trying coconut oil, though. That actually works better than just about anything else I've tried. If you decide to go there, look for unrefined extra virgin coconut oil. I like Dr. bronner's."
8521,"Ener-G Foods English Muffins, 14.8-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,My mom has had Celiac for 15 years now. She is always looking for good gluten free products. I bought her theses for Christmas one year and she loved them! Now I buy her some all the time!!
8522,Tweezerman Mini Slant Tweezer,0/0,1.0,"I do not like the slant Tweezers, they do not grip little hairs properly. Much prefer the straight tip and also the scissors type, which appear to be unobtainable at present. Not a happy chappy!"
8523,"Now Foods, ADAM Superior Men's Multiple Vitamin",0/1,3.0,"For the price, I think this s good basic multi-vitamin. Nothing special. But, if you are an athlete, or train harder than Joe Couch-potato, then I would recommend a more robust product. While taking these, I felt my workouts were not as intense and I felt my endurance suffered. I did not have this experience when using Animal Pak or GNC Mega Mens Sport. If you just require a basic multi-vitamin, this should work for you, but if you do any kind of physical activity, such as cardio, or lifting, I would find a vitamin that is geared towards athletes."
8524,Prolana (Olan Laboratories) Nail Optimizer .5 oz,0/0,5.0,"I first came across this product in a nail salon. It was suggested that I use it for my problem nails (peeling, weak). That was about 12 years ago...I have used it ever since for my base coat and top coat. For me it does the trick. Also, just recently, I had my 81 yo mother-in-law use it on her nails (she has been allergic to nail polish for years). She knew it was a good product for her because it didn't make her nails itch. So a double endorsement!"
8525,Smokehouse 100% Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats,0/0,5.0,"good product , not just pieces but full ears , shipped on time , less expensive than than the chain stores ."
8526,Nature's Way Melissa/Lemon Balm,0/0,4.0,"My doctor recommended this supplement for calm. I am sure this is fine, but I am going to try Gaia Melissa Supreme Extract next to see if I feel more calm. I take way too many pills. If it goes too fast, I'm going back to Nature's Way -- this one! Generous bottle!"
8527,"Doctor's Best - Glucosamine/Chondroitin/Msm,",0/0,5.0,My wife uses MSM and found this to be excellent. The fact that she wanted this particular brand when there are tons to choose from locally tells me alot. Nutrition is hard to completely validate by any one nutrient...but this one is working for her joints as a licensed massage therapist.
8528,Moom Nourishing Hair Remover,0/0,1.0,"Had high hopes from this product after looking at the reviews. Verdict - fail! Does absolutely nothing to pull out those hairs, after being applied exactly as per directions. Forget the thicker hair on the legs, this product did not yank out even the think sparse hair on my arms. Absolutely not recommended !"
8529,Rainbow Light Menopause One Multi,0/1,3.0,First time I have ever tried this multi. I have used Alive! in the past. I will probably go back to Alive!
8530,NOW CANDIDA CLEAR Vegetarian Capsules,0/0,4.0,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano"
8531,"Python No Spill Clean and Fill Aquarium Maintenance System, 50-Feet",0/0,5.0,"Upon advice from a friend who had same, purchased this item to clean the gravel at bottom of a 24&#34; deep tank. Works great."
8532,"Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kit, Colors may vary",1/1,2.0,"The fit is odd. I am a normal-sized woman with a normal-sized mouth. The large was too big and the small was too small (WAY too small). When I wear it at night, I can feel my teeth shift, and it's uncomfortable."
8533,Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers School Bus,0/0,5.0,"This bus was a hit at my grand-daughter's 2nd birthday party. She loved taking the figures in and out the door. It pushes very easily, the sounds and songs are clear and age-appropriate. She loved the lights that really lit up.....and the horn that beeped. She has a couple of other buses that don't do as much; this one was a real hit."
8534,Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit,0/0,5.0,"Pretty much being bald was no problem after all being around a dad,uncles and cousins with the same lack of hair made it pretty acceptable and knowing what was going to happen anyway. The only problem was the lack of a standard barber I mean I have no hair so what's the use for a stylist? So after trying many hair shaver with passing grades I found Wahl has been the most longest lasting and best hair shaver to have at such an affordable price.If You don't want to shave all your hair off or what you have left this is also a nice one to have as it gives a detailed specifications on which accessory to use when trimming your hair or if someone else in your family is doing the trimming. So if you're one of my fellow bald brothers or a receding sibling who is secure enough not to worry about trying to comb over your two hair strands then this is a perfect product to have and for those who are looking for an affordable alternative to going to a hair stylist look no farther."
8535,Spectrum 33300 Mop And Broom Organizer,0/0,3.0,"Again I'm waiting for my move - but it looks like what I wanted it for the job, and it looks good."

8537,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"My husband had shown me this awhile ago. When I asked him for Christmas gift ideas he mentioned this. Little did he know, I already had purchased it and had it wrapped. He loves it."
8538,Carb Solutions High Protein Shake Mix for Low Carb Diets,0/0,3.0,"This product would taste fine if it didn't contain artificial sweetener. This was a bit disappointing. I wish I could have read the ingredients, not just the nutritional label."
8539,"Kleen Free Naturally, Natural, Non-Toxic, Enzyme Solution and Multi-Purpose Cleaner",0/0,5.0,"This product was purchased to prevent bed bugs, when I heard that neighbors had the problem. I found that it is an EXCELLENT CLEANER -- everything from soap scum/mold on shower curtains & &#34;grout&#34; -- to stains on clothes, carpet, show curtains (anything!) -- it lifts it off with minimal scrubbing. Excellent product! It was delivered promptly -- use it diluted or full-strength -- no harsh odors, and no skin reactions. I will KEEP THIS IN STOCK IN MY HOUSE."
8540,Protein Energizer (Rice Protein),0/0,4.0,I really like the taste of this protein powder; the only negative I have is the package. Since it comes in a small package everytime you put your hand in to scoop out the powder it makes a mess all over the counter; which is also wasting product. The product is good but if maybe it was in a canister there would not be so much waste and mess. This is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars; the protein powder is too expensive to waste.
8541,Barbasol Shaving Cream 11 oz (312 g),0/0,5.0,This is bar none the best shaving cream I have ever used. I have tried all of the fancy ones but this is old school stuff that just works well.
8542,Aquis Self-Securing Hair Turban,0/0,5.0,I had one of these given to me over 7 yrs ago...it has worked great the entire time. I finally decided to replace it with a new one and I have given these as gifts to all the girls!
8543,Andis Detachable Clipper Combs,0/0,4.0,The attachments are made well and can be used for a long time. The don't break easily like the Speed-O-Guides.
8544,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Folding Princess Castle,0/0,4.0,"I got this at a good price, $47, and my three kids use it quite a bit (2, 4, and 7). As noted in other reviews, the hinges were broken upon arrival, in my case the wood split where the hinges are screwed into the wood. There were also a couple other places that broken loose. I was able to fix it all with some wood glue rather easily. As long as this thing isn't moved around a lot, I think it will hold up fine, but it definitely too heavy for the weak hinges/thin wood combination.But otherwise, its very cute and provides lots of entertainment for the kids. My daughters use all sorts of dolls and my son gets in on the act with his animals and superheroes, etc...I would be more disappointed in the construction quality if I had paid full price, so keep that in mind."
8545,Brio Rechargeable Engine 8WD,0/0,4.0,"We like this engine. We also have a spare battery pack we swap out when the battery in use needs charging. Very strong, pulling and pushing a 10 car wooden train with up and down multiple level hills, tracks and routes. Wish we could have this in a more character based body (ie Thomas and friends or Chuggington editions). having said that this is an excellent engine. Highly recommended."
8546,U.S.M.C. 1st M.E.U. Action Figure by Dusty Trail Toys ( Marine Expeditionary Unit ),0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my father for his birthday . My father is a retired Iraqi veteran so I knew he'd love it. We moved a couple of months back and he had a statue of a soldier that he became protective over so I got him this one to add a long with the other one. He love it , and so did I !"
8547,BeautyBlender Sponge,0/0,5.0,I absolutely LOVE this sponge! I have used different applicators in the past and this is far the best. Saturate with water and wring out apply LIQUID foundation and apply. Foundation goes on nicely...does not settle in the creases. Leaves a nice even coverage!

8551,Key-E Suppositories with Natural Vitamin E,1/1,5.0,My doctor reccomended this product to me. At first I bought from a health food store but found that bybuying online I am saving a lot. This is an excellent product.
8552,Finch Feeder Sock - 100033943 - Bci,0/0,5.0,Great source for basic gold finch bag which turns our lawn into a bevy of yellow tweeting winged loves! I will use this source often.
8553,Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser,0/0,3.0,I would have continued giving this to all our dogs if they had liked it.The 2 Shih-Tzu's refused to eat their food if we put this in and they would not take it straight from the bottle. Our English Mastiff took it once and a while but he was not thrilled with it. Possibly if we had started our pets on this at a younger age they would have acquirred a taste for it. I am a bit disappointed they didn't like it. Silly dogs!
8554,"Traditional Medicinals Organic, Peppermint, 16-Count (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"This is fantastic tea. I drink it in the a.m. and sometimes at night. It soothes the stomach and works well hot, warm, or cold."
8555,Mentadent Advanced Whitening Fluoride Toothpaste Pump-3.5 oz,0/0,5.0,"Although I ordered this product, I was sent the Mentadent with baking soda instead. I don't really care. I've used Mentadent for years and like it very much, although this is the first time I've had this variety. I like it, too. The toothpaste is very good, IMO, however what I really love is the delivery system. If I could buy refillable dispensers like this I certainly would. Since I've been unable to buy any Mentadent toothpaste locally, I'm pleased to have found some on Amazon."
8556,Total X-Stream AIR (Refill),0/0,5.0,"I bought these for the Buzz Lightyear Spaceshooter, they fit the gun very well, and work great in this gun."
8557,Munchkin 'White Hot' Duck Bath Toy,0/0,4.0,"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for 8-month-old grandson. His mom was very happy to get it, loved that it indicates if the water is too hot for baby. I thought the item was a bit costly when I was ordering it, especially just for one duck. But when it arrived it was larger than I had anticipated."

8560,Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker,0/0,5.0,"We bought this toy for our nephew. It is smaller than you think, but it is oh so cute! It is made of wood, which we love about it. It is brightly painted and the rings arent heavy for a child. Our nephew loves it!"
8561,Candy Blocks 2 Lbs.,0/0,5.0,"I bought these to go with a Lego City police cruiser cake I made for my son's 10th birthday (I placed some randomly around the cake on the board.) These were a big hit with everyone. The kids were able to build with them, and we all loved the taste (like Sweet Tarts!) I may by more for Christmas stocking stuffers."
8562,"Old Mother Hubbard Crunchy Classic Snacks for Dogs, Original Assortment",0/0,5.0,"My dog loves these, and I like that they are all natural. I like the tiny size so he can have one everytime he comes back into the house after being out, but because they are small he doesn't get a lot of added calories. I use the largest size as his &#34;big bone treat&#34; when he comes in for the last time at night."

8567,"Radio Flyer 2700Z Pathfinder Wagon, Red",0/0,5.0,It surpassed our expectations. Our daughter has 11 month twins and this is perfect. They love it. They cry when they have to get out and sit in it in the house and Dad pulls them down the hall; We would highly recommend this to everyone that has children. Now we want to purchase the canopy for spring and summer.
8568,Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I had been buying cheaper Wahl beard trimmers for years. I tried these at my baber shop and realized that I needed to upgrade immediately. These cut close, don't pull, and have cheap replaceable blade. You really can't beat these."
8569,Melissa & Doug 60-Piece Standard Unit Blocks,0/0,5.0,"These blocks are wonderful! They are well-made and my 3 year old and all her friends love them. At first I was worried they were too big, but they have been fantastic."

8572,Myoplex Carb Control RTD (11 fl.oz.),0/0,3.0,The taste is pretty good and it does the trick as a meal replacement but when you get towards the bottom you get clumps. Tried shaking them but it doesn't work.
8573,Stacker 3,0/0,5.0,"All in all, this product has helped me to maintain an 80 lb. weight loss for 2 years now. It didn't necessarily help me lose the weight, but it definitely has a hand in helping me keep it off."
8574,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,My cat has played for hours with this toy and as the ball does not come out it can never be lost. Really keeps the cat occupied. Excellent value for money and will last for years. Would highly recommend

8580,Source Naturals Coenzymate B Complex Orange,0/1,4.0,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/jYlSF ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told that CoQ1O is a very powerful antioxidant and neutralises free radicals. It is widely used to support healthy cardiovascular. It also works with vitamin E to protect cell membranes (and particularly immune cell membranes) from free radical attack, thus boosting the immune system. CoQ10 is found in virtually every cell in the body, primarily in cellular mitochondria, and it is a vital component of the electron transport chain which generates 95 percent of the body's energy via ATP. It can cross the blood brain barrier and further studies have shown a protective role in delaying dementia.The Dr told me I should take meds to control my slightly elevated blood pressure (138/93). I tried this. I noticed a small difference in my energy level on just the 3rd day. On the 6th day, I increased to 2 capsules per day and began noticing a difference in my severe allergy symptoms as well. After 3 weeks my BP reading is 122/84. My mother has had a high cholesterol problem since her early 20's. She used the product along with Red Yeast Rice( goo.gl/koavD ) to reduce her cholesterol count from 300 down to 167 in just 6 months. Amazing!"

8583,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,1/2,3.0,"There are a few design flaws in this dryer that aren't so annoying that I returned it, but are bad enough that I wouldn't buy it again.Firstly, the temperature and on/off switches are not raised at all so it's difficult to move them--especially when you are right out of the shower and have lotion and/or hair gel on your hands. I usually have to wrap my hand in a t-shirt to switch between hot and cool. Another thing that annoys me is that the handle vibrates when it's on. This is the first hair dryer I've bought that is any fancier than a $20 one from Target, so maybe all these higher powered ones do that--but the constant tingling when I dry my hair bugs me.The dryer has a ton of power, but I find that when I use the highest power setting, it just blows my hair around like crazy and gets it all tangled. I usually have to stop mid-dry to brush all the tangles out. And even though it's so powerful, I don't feel like my actual dry time is shortened."
8584,"Kyjen Puzzle Plush Egg Babies Dog Toy, Fish, 5 Eggs",0/0,5.0,"Just the right size for my 9 & 11 lb poodles. They play with the Platypus, but the real attraction is the eggs. They don't play with balls, but the eggs are soft and easier to chew on. They have a loud squeek and they are light so they roll and bounce around better than balls. Well made and strong enough to last."
8585,Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this for my elderly mother and she really likes it. In fact we went back and bought more when the first ones wore out from lots of washing. This pad gives excellent coverage and has a soft surface that allows for it to be placed on top of the sheet to catch accidents and avoid having to wash the sheets. The extended sides allows it to be tucked in securely so that it does not bunch up and become uncomfortable even when you move around in your sleep. It is small enough to be easily washable in a standard machine and is a quality product. We will buy it again, I am sure."
8586,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,4.0,"I like the Zoya Nail Polish, in &#34;Raven&#34;.. it needs 2 coats, which is normal for most nail polishes. It's very black.. I'm not sure its my favorite formula ever though. Nothing is really wrong with it, but for some reason I'm not jumping over the moon for it.. its prettty good though and I'm sure I'll use it whenever I want nice black nails. I think I'm going to try Union Jack by Butter London next though and I'll try to compare which black is best."
8587,Bio Ionic Silver Classic Series Paddle Brush,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this brush after a recommendation from my stylist. From the start, I noticed how silky soft my hair felt after using the brush. My carpool buddy noticed the shine in my hair and questioned whether I got it treated. I told her it's was becuase the new Bio Ionic paddle brush I was using. I'm practical and originally didn't buy into the whole ionic line. But now, I'd like to explore other products such as a hairdryer.I have super straight and thick Asian hair, and definitely recommend this brush. I purchased the round brush at the same time, but don't feel I get the same results. I think it's because the bristles are more thinner and sharper than the paddle brush and I'm too scared of harming my hair with it."
8588,Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier - Navy,0/0,5.0,I am extremely pleased with my purchase! Not only was the item in great condition but I also received my item before scheduled. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and the seller for being so punctual. Two thumbs up!
8589,Pur Minerals Lipstick 0.14 fl oz.,0/0,2.0,I cannot find this in Ulta stores any longer. One tube was great. The other was old and dried out.
8590,Unger Industries/InCom 960280 Cobweb Duster,0/0,5.0,"This is by far the best dust brush for high windows, chandeliers and crownmolding. Twist it for spiderwebs easy to handle."
8591,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"Our new cat is a bit picky. She won't eat every food and she won't play with every toy. She differs greatly from our last kitty, who is in kitty heaven now.Even after over a year of ownership of this item, she is in love with it.We pull it around and about and she just plays and plays.I am sure your less &#34;royal&#34; kitty would love it too."
8592,"Jovan Musk Women Cologne Concentrate Spray by Jovan, 3.25 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I love Jovan Musk. I've been wearing it exclusively for close to 3 decades. The scent is light, not overpowering. I get compliments on it all the time."
8593,Malem Ultimate Selectable Bedwetting Alarm with Vibration - Royal Blue,1/2,5.0,Wasn't sure if it would really work. But I was very happy with the quick results. Amazing and he didn't have any relapse. Definitely recommend for parents who have tried everything else.
8594,"Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1-ounce Tube",0/0,2.0,"This product doesn't work any better than the other more reasonable products out there with the same results, very little difference in moisturizing for the face. I would not waste my money."
8595,Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Solid Baby Carrier,0/0,2.0,"I bought this since other Mom's I know raved about it. First I paid $50 for what is basicly a HUGE piece of heavy fabric. You then have to practive wrapping this thing around you. It takes time to learn how to wrap it properly. If you want to go any where in public with this thing on you better put it on before you leave the house since you will never figure it out once you are away from a mirror. My daughter cried EVERY time I put her in this. She didn't like it at all. The two times I did get her to calm down and stay in it she got over heated quickly even though she was just wearing a onesie. This material is so thick and having that on the baby plus your body heat and your baby will be cooking! I gave up and returned it and so did some of the ladies I know after they had the same issue. Great idea, but huge fail. Not to mention if you really want to try this buy some fabric and wrap it around yourself for less then half the cost."
8596,"Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal Meal Replacement Bar, Super Cookie Crunch, 12 Bars, 3.52 Ounces",0/0,2.0,"I bought these because I read an article (that was obviously wrong) saying that these only had 2grams of sugarbut it has 26grams!!!! that's more than a regular chocolate/candy bar.taste wise they are pretty good but that's because anything dipped in sugar is delicious.I don't care how much Protein it has if you are hurting everything else.if you are serious don't buy them, if you don't have weight problems and want the protein go ahead and buy these candy bars."
8597,"Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,Excellent price for a great product. Use every day with unsweetened oatmeal (and raisins). Perfect to add a healthful ingredient and sweeten it a bit.

8599,"PowerBar Harvest Whole Grain Energy Bar, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)",0/0,4.0,I am always on the go and officiate a few sports. It's always nice to throw one of these in my bag and munch on between games or right after just to make sure I have something that I can digest while running and isn't junk food. They taste great and aren't overly sweet. They are also good to hold you over while on the run between meetings or traveling from home to the airport. I'm not a big fan of sweets and this product is not overly sweet at all. Filling on-the-go and not too sweet for activity. Good stuff!
8600,Lundberg Rice Chips Made with Organic Grains,0/0,5.0,"I get these fantastic chips by the case, over and over. They are super crunchy and perfect for a gluten-free snack. Totally the best."

I wear this as an everyday scent and receive many compliments on it. The scent does not wear off as fast as many other perfumes I wear so I definitely recommend it! Great price for an everyday perfume!
8602,Buck 395BK Omni Hunter 10pt Lock Back Folding Knife,0/0,4.0,"The knife was nice and sharp and well built. It just is bigger than I had expected. That isn't the manufacturers issue but if you are looking for something you can put in your pocket, this knife isn't it."
8603,"Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, SPF 15, 4 Ounce",0/0,3.0,I was very eager to buy this face moisturizer when I saw that it's oil free but got disappointed because it still brings oil to my face in less than an hour after applying it! So I really don't know now which brand to trust whenever they claim such things on their products nevertheless I'm still using it since I found a way to at least diminish the oiliness on my face after applying it.

8610,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,This flosser is the best. I have some implants and dreaded using the thread flossers on the market for that purpose. They hurt when threading and tugging around the implant. My dental hygienist uses a high powered water pulsing instrument to really clean and massage the gums. I saw this and decided to give it a try. I've been using this flosser for several months and my check-ups have been excellent. They are spreading the word through the practice for anyone who has implants and those without as well. I don't use all the extra gadgets included in the package but this product is great. Can't go to sleep without flossing 'cause my mouth really feels clean.
8611,"Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black",0/0,5.0,"This mask is superb for meditations, relaxation and going to sleep/ waking up.

8612,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,1.0,"This is no good at all. Streaks and uneven paint. As much as I tried to make this look good it would just not do it. I have been doing my own nails for years so I know a good product. It's is cheap, poorly made nail polish. It makes your nails look like you painted them with pink chalk. Do not buy this."
8613,REALITIES by Liz Claiborne Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz (Women),0/0,5.0,"His was my favorite perfume and I am so disappointed that they stopped producing it. It brings back many fond memories ! It' a beautiful, crisp, refreshing, mildly sweet scent !"

8620,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"I love the pampers baby dry. I have 2 sons in diapers, so we go through A LOT of diapers! We have tried every brand on the market, store brands, big name brands, ALL of them. There are other brands that worked as well but these are the most economical of the bunch. My kids stay dry through the night, no leaks, they are soft so I feel like my kids are comfortable. I can't say enough good things about these."
8621,Chuckit! Medium Tennis Fanatic 2.5-Inch,0/0,5.0,This is my dog's favorite toy. I have to buy in bulk because she plays with it so much. perfect size for my blueheeler.
8622,"Vero Mango, Chili Covered Mango Flavored Lollipops, 40 Pieces",0/0,1.0,"I should have listened to the other reviews, but a friend had mentioned trying -- and loving -- a product like this (I can only guess it was another brand) and it sounded *so* good. If I had been able to to tolerate the saltiness long enough, perhaps there would have been spiciness. I can't overstate just how salty and gross these were. Perhaps the mango beneath was tasty -- I cannot attest to that. I believe another reviewer mentioned &#34;taming&#34; these down by wiping off some of the coating. I can't imagine how one would approach that task, as it really is very well-adhered. If anyone can suggest a better brand, I'd love to know of it -- this combo sounds like it could be wonderful if handled right."
8623,"BSN Noxplode 2.0, 2.48 Pounds",0/0,1.0,"I have been lifting for about 25 years and have never had a supplement mess me up as bad as this stuff did. Bottom line, I couldn't sleep for about 40 hours straight after taking one serving. After doing a little research I discovered that I wasn't the only person with this problem, but I was lucky. Some folks were messed up for quite a while longer. I have never had ill effects from any other supplement I've taken from BSN or energy supplements from other manufacturers for that matter. Definitely a buyer beware product."
8624,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,4.0,It works and we have a very hairy golden. Would recommend to all dog owners. Wouldhave rated 5 but you really can't do it in an enclosed area. Its wonderful though. Thumbs up! B R
8625,Stress B-Complex Caps by TwinLab 100 Capsules,0/0,5.0,The Twinlab Stress B-Complex Caps with Vitamin C give me the feeling of more energy. Also I have been sick less since I started taking them. I don't know if it is a placebo effect but I feel better and would recommend them to my friends. I have been happy with all the Twinlab vitamins I have tried.

8627,Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets,0/0,5.0,I love this product!!! I have a 2yr old Labrador. He was diagnosed with FMCP Bi-laterly when he was nine months old. For people who don't know this is one form of elbow dysplasia and he has it in both elbows. Needless to say I was a little freaked out. I was conscerned that I would have to put him down before the 12-15 years I had planned to spend with him had passed. It broke my heart that I might only have my pup for 5-8 years. My puppy's SportsVet recomended this product. He is doing great and I know that this product is not only reducing the progression of his condition but because he doesn't miss a day it is acutally going to extend his life.My Lab will even beg for one because he thinks these are treats. I don't know if all dogs would like them but if you own a 'foodie' dog they certainly wont' refuse them.This is truely a very affordable product. After the first weeks (4-6?) the dosage is one tablet per day for my Lab is one tablet per day. This means my bottle lasts for 150 days. When you divide the dosage (1 chewable pill) and the amount per bottle (150) by the days used (150) Dasaquin is cheaper than most other products on the market.
8628,Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver,0/0,5.0,Awesome! My husband loves this razor!!! He loves the self cleaning aspect and that it is cordless! Great close shave!!!

8631,Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica,0/0,4.0,"Though the taste takes 2-3 times to get used to, it seems like a truly natural product and I recommend it for those who prefer health over taste."
8632,PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box,0/0,5.0,"I absolutely love this box. I had never had an automatic cleaning litter box before and decided to buy this one on a whim. After reading the reviews I contemplated sending it back but I kept it and boy am I glad I did. I have had this litter box for over 4 months and the pros greatly outweigh the cons of this machine. Yeah,my cat kicks litter out sometimes but I would much rather sweep some litter for two seconds then scoop dirty litter everyday. I never have a problem with the conveyor, my cat loves it and there is no disgusting urine smell. When this one goes out I will definitely buy another Petsafe litter box."

8636,Ecco Bella Flowercolor Natural Mascara Black 0.38 oz,0/0,1.0,"Reading the previous reviews, I was looking forward to using this product; as a redhead I need a true brown mascara. The mascara itself is a true brown, however within hours of application all the mascara flaked off my lashes and ended up under my eyes. I didn't realize until I got home from work that I'd been walking around with racoon eyes all afternoon. I do not recommend this, I had the same problems with the Just For Redheads products."

8639,Snoozer Console Pet Car Seat Cream Fur,0/0,3.0,"This is good for what it is. Its a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I should have done more research. Its made nicely and the pup seems to like it ok.I think it will work for short trips. If you have a very small dog it will work just fine, any dog over five pounds will be uncomfortable, my opinion only.I will buy a larger one next timeThank YouBob and Char"
8640,Dynasty Chinese Five Spice Powder,0/0,5.0,"The spice itself is great--better than a couple of other brands I tried, but I have to dip it out since it does not have a sprinkle lid which would be nice."

It can definitely burn, but I kind of like that in an aftershave. My ex-gf really liked the smell, so she bought me a new bottle when I ran out. This is definitely my aftershave of choice"

8648,"Marvy Shaving Gift Set Contains Mug, Brush, And Soap",0/0,3.0,"Disappointed. So disappointed I gave away as a gift. cheap brush, plastic mug, no wonder they charge less than $8 dollars for this and it is not worth it. Buy a VanDerHagen at Walmart for $2 more."

My dog, a lab/rhodesian ridgeback, comes running up to me, turns around and waits as I put her coat on her before she goes out when its cold and snowy here in KC.

8657,CytoSport Muscle Milk,0/0,5.0,I've always been a fan of Muscle Milk pre-portioned drinks so it was only natural that I went with MM for my supplement base. The base is great by itself with either water or milk and I've used both the Light and Whey versions and enjoy them all - but the base chocolate is my preferred as it is the right balance of what I am looking for in my meal base (protein / carbs / cal's et cetera) to which I add my on variations for taste / nutrition.

My daughter's older cat went crazy for them and still liked carrying them around after the scent wore down. So, works for some and not for others."

8671,Lixit Heavy Duty Glass Water Bottle - 8 oz,0/0,5.0,we are rehabing 2 orphaned squirrels who seem to enjoy chewing through water bottles. This one has survived! good quality and well made. does not leak!
8672,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,Loved this product. The color was what I was expecting and the quality of the nail polish is great. Look forward to getting more Zoya polish in the future.
8673,"Larabar Fruit and Nut Food Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)",0/0,5.0,"This is a great snack for any one going raw. It is not a meal substitute. The fat content is a little high for dieting, but it comes from raw nuts."
8674,Premier Squirrel Dude Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"Our dog loves this toy. I think it might not hold up to a really intense chewer, but for our 20 pound poodle, it's ideal. It's harder to get things out of than a Kong and provides him with hours of entertainment. We stuff it with chicken jerky and he works hard to get it out."
8675,Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Freezer Trays With Lids,0/0,5.0,"These trays stack well which is great for storage in the freezer. The lid seals well. Each ""square"" holds about 1 tablespoon."
8676,"Spring Tree Organic Maple Syrup, Grade B, 1-Quart Jug (Pack of 12)",0/0,2.0,"This stuff is mid to late season, best used for cooking. Far too dark and molasses like for pancakes or waffle use."
8677,Thylox Medicated Soap - 3.25 oz. - Bar,0/0,4.0,"I have very mild acne and incipient rosacea; this sulfur soap helped with both. Of course it smells like sulfur, but it's bearable; it also dries the skin a little bit, but I applied a moisturizer immediately after washing with the soap and had no problems with the dryness. All these are minor cons, compared with the pros.However, there is quite a significant promise the manufacturer profess, but doesn't accomplish"
8678,Catalyst Eau de Toilette for Women by Halston,0/0,5.0,Great price. This is the first bottle of this perfume that I have bought where the atomizer actually works. Would recommend buying.
8679,J.R. Watkins Apothecary Petro-carbo medicated first aid salve 4.37 oz,0/0,5.0,"I grew up with my mom using this stuff on me and my brother in place of stuff like neosporin. Works great on all cuts scrapes burns and minor flesh wounds. Had wonderful experience with this stuff through my entire child hood and now I'm 25 and on my own keeping this stuff in my house. Would recommend this to anyone! It may be a few bucks more than your average stuff but a little goes a long way, the full size tin lasts a LONG time and it is SOOOO worth every penny!!!!!!"
8680,Bruce Half Gallon Hardwood/Laminate Floor Cleaner Refill,0/0,5.0,I have purchased many different types of floor cleaners for my laminate floor. Bruce is by far the best one out there.

8682,Optima 365 for DOGS -Gallon,0/0,1.0,"Our dogs absolutely hate the taste of this product. And our dogs are not picky eaters. They are a mini poodle and a rottweiler. And they will eat anything. But not this. I had high hopes for this product as my rottie sheds quite a bit. But i have to try and disguise this supplement in canned dogfood, and even then, the rottie will not touch it."
8683,"Ozium Glycol-Ized Professional Air Sanitizer / Freshener Original Scent, 0.8 oz. aerosol (OZ-1)",1/1,5.0,"I discovered back in the 80's that ozium is the only thing that stands any chance of clearing the air after smoking herb, and started using it them. Decades later, there is still no substitute for dealing with the toughest clouds of dank smoke. A must-have item for 420 smokers."
8684,"Bob's Red Mill Organic Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"Very-very excellent addition to any meal. Shared portions with friends. All enjoyed taste and healthy benefit added to salads, broiled fish/chicken and vegetables."
8685,"Mabis Dmi Healthcare Combination Douche and Enemasystem with Water Bottle, Red, One",0/0,2.0,At first everything was fine. But after a few uses the screw in nozzles started to leek. It makes a big mess in a way you don't want it to. The hose is also stiff and doesn't flow well.The bag portion and the hook are nice. The clamp works fine.
8686,"Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush, Black",0/0,5.0,"I have bought many curling products and they are in a drawer, so I was skeptical ordering this......My hair is long and this does the trick. It gives me curl where I want it.....I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.....Rememeber it is not air blown. it is actually a curling iron with teeth which makes is doubly easy to use......If you need a straightener or curling iron buy this ...you will not be disappointed"
8687,"Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash for Clean, Clear Skin, 8.5 Ounce",0/0,2.0,This product dried my skin and did not help my acne at all. I was expecting a better product from Neutrogena.

8691,Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery organizer with Removable Tester,0/0,4.0,"Tester is a bit cheesy but, hey for the price it works just fine. I put the new batteries in the top rows and then pull older batteries from the bottom rows to keep rotating stock. First time in years I don't have to dig around in two or three kitchen drawers to find batteries, then wonder if they were fresh or old."
8692,Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,"I started using the vitamins years ago for hair growth. I always buy them in stores, and finally got the bright idea to check on Amazon. So much cheaper and same great vitamin. Oh, also I started using the regular Women's vitamin from this brand because of the ginger. All other vitamins made me throw up literally every time I tried to take them. These are wonderful."

8694,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,4.0,"We have an aging Boxer who needed a new bed. This looked perfect in the photo. He loves it & is very happy with it. I think that it gives him more space to stretch out, and also returns more body heat on cold days. However, I am finding that the very light cover is going to be a real nuisance.........it shows every spec of dirt that comes in from outside."
8695,Cozy Support Knee Sleeve,0/0,5.0,Fits nicely without binding or rolling down. My knees feel so much better now that I've finally found this product.

8699,"Rogaine for Women Hair Regrowth Treatment (2-Ounce Bottles, Pack of 3)",1/1,1.0,"I started using this product because several Doctor's told me that it was the best thing that I could do to prevent losing my hair folicles for good. I finally decided to use it, after a month using I had issues of headaches and blurred vision and EXTREAM hair loss. I had to stop it because of medical reasons but I wish I never when on it to begin with. PLEASE TAKE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BEFORE YOU START THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
8700,Nature's Life Icelandic Kelp,0/0,5.0,"To my knowledge, this is one of the lowest potency Kelp tablets available. Still, it is 225% above MRDA and for me, it's what my body needed. I eat right (mostly), don't take any prescription drugs and exercise at least 3 times a week for twenty minutes. That given, I'm still 68 years old and while I have a full head of hair (huge and really long right now) something seemed to be lacking from my - ah - focus and concentration capabilities of only a few years ago.I read about the catalyst function of Iodine in my diet and remembered that Kelp has one of the highest levels of Iodine which occurs in nature. This version served the purpose of seemingly functioning as a catalyst to get the rest of my nutrition working. I don't know if that is exclusively true or scientifically or a technically true statement - but I feel better and can create valid, if intricate sentences again. That's what I was looking for and what it achieved.The price was right - the results were better than expected.I'll buy again when I need it."
8701,Genco Pomace Olive Oil - 1 Gallon,0/0,5.0,"Genco Pomace Olive Oil - 1 Gallon. Arrived very quickly and exactly as described, a great product at a good price so very happy to order again."

8703,"Summer Infant Deluxe Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5"" Screen, Blue",0/0,5.0,"This was a great monitor, worked so well.The screen picture stopped working after we dropped it a few too many times (after about 3 years) - then we used it for sound.If we were upstairs and my son was in bed but sick, or if we were outside.It just now completely died and my son is 5 1/2.That was definitley worth the money and a great product, gave us more years than I expected. :)"
8704,"Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning, White Cheddar, 2.85-Ounce Shakers (Pack of 6)",0/0,1.0,Not what I was looking for tastes like dirty feet and smells like the same. Tastes more like parmesan than cheddar.
8705,Paul Mitchell The Detangler (select option/size),1/1,1.0,"horrible - don't purchase this. Useless. Doesn't act as a conditioner, less alone a detangler. I'm pretty sure someone just put lotion in the bottle."
8706,Iron-Tek Essential Natural 100% Protein,0/0,5.0,"this is a very good, all natural protein powder. i recommend it. I don't know if it is primarily whey though."

8708,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,These fit my son nicely. He weighs 29 pounds. They soak up and hold a good amount of tinkle at night.
8709,Wellness Super5Mix Dry Dog Food,0/1,3.0,"I did the wrong thing at first and did not transition him effectively from his previous dog food. Now I know why it is clearly written on the packaging. My 105 lb Dobe had the loudest farts (which created a lot of entertainment until you had to leave the room), explosive gas and the runs. He still has bad gas from this food and it has been 3 months. I don't think his system works well with this. He seems constantly hungry too. I will be transitioning him to something different by the end of the month.I originally purchased this due to a recommendation from a friend. I guess it works great with her German Shepherd and Pittbull. She claimed that it made their coats shiny, their mood was better, and they seemed satisfied instead of constantly hungry.Too bad it had the opposite effect in our household."
8710,"Nutri-Pet Research Nupro Joint Supplement for Dogs, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,"I was really really sceptical about this product. Was not sure if my dog would like it. When I read that you could add water and make it like gravy, I decided to give it a try. My dog LOVES it. She licks her bowl clean. I specifically got it for the arthritis and hip dysplasia issues. Time will tell. She has only be on it for less than a week. I will update in a few weeks."
8711,"EX5 - Ibiza Extra Large Round Brush with Extended Cork Handle, 20 Rows of Bristles",0/0,5.0,"This brush deserves highest rating because it smooths my hair like none other. As an African American woman I was uncertain about this type of brush for my hair. But, I truly like how it makes my previously unmanageable hair lay down effortlessly!!!"
8712,PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer,0/0,5.0,"Charger works great. I rotate batteries often for use in my EDC flashlight, and various other electronic devices such as my GPS, and camera flashes. Having 4 independent channels to charge batteries at various states of charge is really a nice thing to have, ensuring all batteries are charged correctly.Charger has more features than I'll probably ever use, but its nice to know they are there should I ever decide to use them.You can select any slot at any time to view by pressing the &#34;slot&#34; button. My only real complaint is after you select the slot, you have to wait for the various readings in that channel to be displayed. For example if I want to view the current voltage of slot 3, I can push slot till 3 is displayed, then I have to wait for time,mah.ma then voltage to be displayed. Not a big deal as it only takes about 8 secs to display but would be nice to set the display to only show one thing, or all information at once. Would recommend this to my friends."
8713,Grossan Hydro Pulse Nasal and Sinus Irrigation System with the Original Grossan Sinus Tip,0/0,5.0,"I've been using the Grossan Irrigator for seven years after my nose/sinus surgery. My ENT insisted on nasal irrigation, and the Grossan product has been reliable."
8714,Love Fills L'air du Temps Eau de Toilette for Women by Nina Ricci,0/0,1.0,My husband usually buys L'Air Du Temps every year for Christmas. This was NOT that purfume. It is horrible. Smells like bug spray.
8715,"Mommy's Helper Safer Grip 11.5"" 40524",0/0,5.0,The handle applies easily and is very stable. I had great confidence that it would support me as I entered and left the tub. I don't believe it would slide or give way under use.
8716,American Health Klamath Shores Blue Green Algae,0/0,5.0,im a canadian nutritionist and i had to say that this is the strongest nutritional supplement anyone can get. it is also very good for your skin if you apply it topically and apply it in a paste or somewhat liquid form. blue green alage is exceptionally good for your immune system and nutthing can detox your body deep like blue green algae.ama
8717,"Pretty Feet & Hands Rough Skin Remover-Exfoliant, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,WOW - GOT RID OF MY ROUGH SKIN IMMEDIATELY -I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT MORE OF THESE -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE

8719,Be Amazing Insta-Worms,0/0,4.0,"My granddaughter got a laugh out of this little example of chemistry for fun, but it was short lived. The good part is how it does work and is amusing to a small child. The bad part is the concept involved is beyond young kids. It is sort of a one time trick just for laughs. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise. It was entertaining and funny."
8720,Rubik's 5X5 Cube,0/0,2.0,get a speed cube 5x5 even if you dont speed cube its better quality. i recommend a shengshou 5x5 .
8721,CrossCribb,0/0,5.0,This gets you to thinking....which is great for our aging generation who live cribbage. We recommend this game and it is easy to learn.
8722,Gummi Crib Rail,0/0,5.0,We had this on the front of our crib and I wish we would have had it on the side rails when we had my daughter. She eat the crib up. I am really happy with it so far. It is very gental on their teeth and gums.
8723,"Botanical Solutions, Inc Tick Guard Tick Repellent",0/0,4.0,I LIKE THIS SO MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OTHER REPELLANTS. IT HAS A PEPPERMINT AND LEMON SMELL THAT IS ALSO MUCH NICER. I HOPE IT'S WORKING BECAUSE LYME DISEASE IS SO PREVELENT IN OUR AREA
8724,HUGO For Women By HUGO BOSS Eau de Toilette,0/0,4.0,entrega puntual y en muy buen estado el producto es de buena calidad hasta el momento es un buen servicio
8725,Panasonic ES246AC Bikini Shaper and Trimmer,0/0,3.0,I like it much better then trying to cut with scissors or using a razor. I brought one for my sister for Christmas and she likes it too.
8726,"Rose Bud Tea, 4oz.",0/0,3.0,"The tea I just ran out of was bought while travelling to China, but the box said the material (the rose buds themselves) were from France. I was looking for French sourced rose buds on internet but found none so ordered this product. My first, visual, impression, was that the rose buds were smaller and had less vibrant coloration - some of the buds look a bit browned. My second impression was sensory - it didn't smell as strong or as good upon opening the package. Still, I soldiered on an steeped my family a pot of this new rose bud tea. Everybody had the same reaction - it didn't have as much of the delicate rose flavor and did not taste the same as the original tea we used earlier in the year. The package says &#34;from China&#34;, but even though it is packaged in the same country of origin, the material used is not the top grade."
8727,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,1.0,Summary
8728,"Sculpey III Polymer Clay Color Sampler, Multicolor",0/0,3.0,"I purchased Sculpey III Polymer clay almost my entire life, and this one must have been very, very new, as it was very soft. Nevertheless, I used it for Christmas. Thank you."
8729,Mommy's Helper Kid Keeper,0/0,4.0,"My 3 y/o son has autism and a genetic abnormality and doesn't respond to commands, understand danger, nor does he fear anything. I don't have a fenced-in yard, so this is a great idea to let him walk and explore &#34;freely&#34; outside without having to hold his hand all the time or me having to worry about him running in the street. It definately increases his independence and adds to his quality of life. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the straps that cross over his shoulders are rough and rub on his neck a little, so I'll have to get some strap guards so they don't scratch or irritate his neck."
8730,Prep Pads,0/0,5.0,These pads are just what I need since I am diabetic and have need of being punctured with syringes and lancets to manage my blood sugar.
8731,Budget Vertebral Column With Stand - CH59X,0/0,5.0,Good price for students. There are some really fancy ones out there with muscles and different colored vertebrae. Those are inpractical and would freak your future clients out.
8732,Sunbeam 732-500 King Size Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,0/0,5.0,family member has been using this pad for neck pain and has been a relief and being from Sunbeam should last.
8733,"Synflex Pets-Liquid Glucosamine Arthritis Formula For Pets, 8oz",0/0,3.0,kept my lab on this for the full 3 months and saw no difference. Disappointed. Maybe she just has too much hip damage at this point. Might have been better if I could have found this when she first started having trouble.
8734,Coochy 16 oz. Cream Green Tea,0/0,5.0,I love this product. My legs feel amazing and it smells nice. No irritation after shaving any area. Great buy.
8735,Powerstep Pinnacle Insole,0/0,5.0,"These off-the-shelf orthotics work great in work shoes as well as tennis/running/cross training shoes. I used to have to get the expensive orthotics from a pedorthist/podiatrist, but I am able to manage my own foot pain with these devices. With the low price, I usually purchase several pairs so that I don't have to keep transferring them to different shoes."
8736,Andis CeramicEdge Blade 10,0/0,4.0,"I have been using this blade, which i got along with andis clipper. Unfortunately the same fell down and broke. I purchase the new blade and yet to start using it. However, i'm writing this review to comment on the delivery experience, with aramex, which was awesome. I'm sure the blade is also going to perform nicely. Thanx"
8737,Do A Dot Art Marker Rainbow 6-pack,0/0,5.0,"Fabulous colors and easy to use for kids of all ages. I do not have paints in my house because I can't deal with the mess. We love these dot paints, they are easy to use, create fabulous art and all with no mess!!! I love the colors too - we got the set with purple, green, red, yellow, blue and orange"
8738,No-Rinse Shampoo - 16 oz,0/0,5.0,"This is a great product. I use it on my son when he chooses to &#34;forget&#34; to wash his hair. It's cold which makes him miserable, but that's part of the joy. ;-) Just kidding, it is cold, but using a towel over the shoulders to catch drips is a good idea. It's very thin, like water, so it does run quite a bit. Pour slowly. Be sure to make a lather so it will work, then just towel dry."
8739,Light Relief 90LR15LR01 Infrared Pain Relief Device,0/0,1.0,The device did not work to relieve my wife's pain like we had hoped it would. I also used it for neck and shoulder pain but did not notice any difference. the heat felt good that's all.
8740,Surprise Hand Buzzer,0/0,5.0,Exactly what i expected. Works great. Was a gift for a child and has held together strong for a long time now. Loved it!

8742,The All NEW Seacret Enriched Facial Mud Mask,0/0,3.0,"The mask does clean the skin, but if the skin is broken due to eczema be careful because it burns!! In combination with Eucerin cream it seems to work."
8743,Zippo Street Chrome Pocket Lighter,0/0,4.0,"Seems to run out fairly quick, even with minimal use. Though it is rumored you can almost always get one last strike out of it by shaking it upside down and tapping the bottom (while it is closed)."
8744,"Maas International Metal Polish, 4-Ounce",0/0,5.0,IT IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. MY MOM IS A BIG FAN OF IT AS WELL.
8745,Merkur Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor,0/0,5.0,"Works great this is a little heavy, but I like the feel, was just what I was looking for, and for a great price! Would definitely buy from again, and recommend for anyone else looking for a solid safety razor."
8746,BRUSHPICKS,0/0,5.0,"You'll never use a wooden pick again. A staple in our house and cars. Once you use them, you'll want more."
8747,Crystal Body Deodorant Crystal Stick For Men,0/0,5.0,"I think I have what's called hyperhidrosis. I sweat constantly, when i am hot, when i am cold and when i am just sitting doing nothing at all. It is embarrassing and annoying too. I had to change my shirt a couple times a day. I tried all the clinically proven antiperspirants with 22% aluminum what evers in them. Mitchum, Certain Dry and others that worked for a short time but usually left me itching and irritated, and sweating after a few weeks. So I tried this Crystal stick. Wow! I stayed mostly dry all day, not irritated and not embarrassed. I do suggest this for sweat problems even though is states its a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. Apply to wet skin right out of the shower and don't wet the stone. When you wet the stone it starts to erode and causes sharp edges like glass on your tender pits. I hope this helps anyone suffering from constant sweating."
8748,"Staunton Tournament Chess Pieces, Triple Weighted with 3.75"" King and 2 extra Queens",1/1,5.0,"This was shipped immediately and I got it in two days! The pieces are heavy enough to stay put. This is a good,basic set. My kids are loving it."
8749,"Dynarex Gauze Sponges, N/S, Pouch/200",0/0,5.0,I wet these and use them to wipe the toothpaste out of my young toddler's mouth--he can't spit yet. They do what they're supposed to! They're textured enough that you can wipe his tongue and effectively wipe off some of the bacteria.
8750,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,Good source of protein and really feel the difference during and after workouts. This is the only supplement I use along with krill oil and lifting weights like its plastic. Get amazing pumps and no soreness at all no matter how hard the workout. I prefer double chocolate flavor though.
8751,Snuggle Safe Pet Bed Microwave Heating Pad,0/0,5.0,I have always worried about the outdoor cats in the neighborhood. I have a house for them but it is still cold in the winter. With the Snuggle Safe Pet Heating Pat the inside of the house and blankets stay warm for around for 8 hours. It is great!!!
8752,Garden of Life Primal Defense,0/0,5.0,I use this product every day. It's the best supplement I have found for acid reflux. Don't want to be without.
8753,Step2 Four Seasons Playhouse - Pink/Purple,0/0,4.0,"I bought this for my 1 and 3 year olds, and they have been in it daily since it arrived last month. It's big enough for them to play comfortably together, and small enough to keep in the house while we wait for better weather. My only complaint is that the pattern/texture on the floor traps a ton of dirt and crumbs, and is a pain to clean. I don't imagine that will matter once it moves outside as I can just hose it down. It seems pretty sturdy and they get a big kick out of the doorbell."
8754,Hudson RCI Medium Concentration Oxygen Mask,0/0,5.0,I use this in emergenciy situations and very pleased with its performance. I will definately recommend to friends. It is as advertised.
8755,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/0,4.0,"when I got this item this morning , it did not have a outside box, and i opened it the reciept is missing as well, this delivery is worse than last time.Have not assembled yet but the rocker looks nice"

8757,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"They play with it all day and the cats like it because its soft and doesn't hit their nose, gentle and great for exercise!"
8758,Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips,2/3,1.0,"I'm 43 and these strips have been around for some time now. Over the years, I have tried these strips and was left disappointed. I'd stop then years later try again, hoping the product had been improved. Each time, I came away with the same result, disappointment.I have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores. I got these strips again a few weeks ago, again, hoping they'd improved. But they didn't. These strips cost $8 for 14 strips.I used an entire box and each time I used one of the strips, it didn't work. The instructions say leave on your nose for about 15 minutes, which I do. When I remove them, the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose. I think its safe to say, I'd never buy or use these strips ever again. Sorry Biore', for me, these strips were a flop."
8759,Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid,0/1,4.0,I like this i have not tried it out on a dog yet because i havent got mine yet. Good feel robust great for the price and i cant even hear it. The one down side is that it doesn't come with batteries and the batterie it uses is a 9 volt alkaline so not your usual 2 double A's.
8760,Hot Spa Paraffin Wax Refill Lavender 16oz.,0/0,5.0,"I have enjoyed using this product, it is as it says, it does work to my satisfaction, Has a nice smell an it is of the best product an glad to find tha Amazon is selling this, for the price to purchase else where, is way too expensive.

8761,La Florentine Torrone 18 pc Assortment Box,0/0,5.0,I had been looking for this favorite childhood candy forever and was thrilled to find it . It is just as delicious as I had remembered it and will be buying more soon.
8762,Kwai Garlic 100mg 180 Tablets,0/0,5.0,"I wish this would become available again. I have not been able to purchase it anywhere. It is absolutely the best garlic supplement I have ever taken, and I started taking it over 10 years ago. There truly is no odor. The pills are small and coated, so very easy to take, with no garlic taste at all. I have very bad allergies and hay fever. Whenever I started to feel congested, or had a scratchy or sore throat, or just felt ""off"" (regardless if it was allergies or maybe a cold coming on) I would take 5 pills at a time, about every 6 hours, until I felt 100% fine- usually within 1 day! Then I would take 3-4 just twice a day for about a week to keep feeling well. If I was exposed to anybody who was sick (which was often since I worked in a health care setting) I did the same thing. I NEVER got sick. YES, I really wish I could get these again!"
8763,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,5.0,Synths 6 taste great and adds to a quick painless recovery after i complette weight training or a long run. I have tried other brands of protein but nothing taste as good as the vanilla Ice Cream flavor of Syntha 6.
8764,VTech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker,0/0,4.0,"We bought this for my son to play with and also to work on sitting to standing. It does have a lot of great interactive options on the front, and he loves pulling the phone off, flipping the gate open and shut, and playing with the shapes. It is a fun toy for him. But a few drawbacks of the toy - 1. the ""low"" volume is really not very low. 2. There is not really enough of an angle between the legs of the toy so it's hard for him to pull up on it. 3. When on ""music"" mode, each item you touch makes a sound, but if you touch something else, the first sound doesn't stop, and so on. It's hard to learn cause and effect if there are 5 things making noise at the same time and he doesn't know which is which."
8765,Sunbeam 731-500 Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,0/0,5.0,sunbeam make a good long lasting product! I did my research and this one offered as many features as some of the more expensive ones! Hot is a little too hot but who can complain about that when it has 3 settings!
8766,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Fish Bowl Jumbo Knob Puzzle,0/0,1.0,I bought this puzzle assuming it was made in the USA because it clearly states &#34;Origin
8767,"Carob Chips, Barley Malt Sweetened, 1 lb.",3/3,1.0,"The chips have palm oil, containing a lot of saturated fat. This was not mentioned in the website. More information should have been provided."

8769,Energizer Max Alkaline Batteries,0/0,2.0,"I bought these because it looked like I was getting a good deal. When they got here, I noticed they are a couple years old. Disappointing because I bought these for the shelf life."
8770,Hot Tools Professional Ceramic Titanium Professional Curling Iron,0/0,4.0,even do I do not use it much but the service was very fast I got the item less then 5 dayswhen I did use the iron couple times I burned my hand it's little hard to use
8771,Eveready Energizer Alkaline Battery Pack - Alkaline - 595mAh - 9V DC,0/0,5.0,These arrived well packaged and worked great in my electronics. I am very happy with this buy and a good value.
8772,Biotest Fahrenheit,0/0,1.0,I wanted the item shown and described as the Biotest Fahrenheit Metabolism Breakthrough for Women as I had used it years ago with positive results. What I received was their generic formula in very different packaging and the actual capsules were different as well. I have no idea if they will work or not but after a week of using them I don't see the same initial results as with the other formula. The items are non-returnable and I ordered 2 bottles so I'm basically stuck with them. Very disappointed in Amazon. Normally I have no issues ordering products from this site.
8773,Beetle Juice [VHS] (1988),0/2,2.0,Weird and dumb. Hated Michael Keaton in this role. ugh.I would not rent this or recommend it. The End
8774,Mattress Genie Bed Lift System,0/0,4.0,This lift works very good and I would recommend it to any one needing head-of-bed elevation for whatever reason. They save you from using blocks to elevate the head of the bed plus allowing for up and down and inbetween posiioning which cannot be done with blocks. Certainly costs less than purchasing the &#34;flexable&#34; beds.
8775,Cover Girl Outlast Double Lip Shine Lip Glosses,0/0,5.0,I love this lip color I'm so happy u guys carry it since cvs discontinued it I was looking for this item everywhere so happy
8776,Smart Temp HC1302 Portable Reusable Hot/Cold Pad,0/0,1.0,"We had previously purchased this product at Medic Drug store in 2004 and it served us well until late 2012. The instructions gave a heating time of 4 minutes for the larger pad. We would microwave it for 4 minutes and the pad held the heat for a couple of hours. Ultimately, the pad had some leakage, so we discarded and ordered the product through amazon. The new model instructions give a heating time of 2 minutes, which we followed. The pad is obviously not as warm as the previous model and does not hold heat as long. After a couple of weeks of usage, the new model began to leak, so we had to discard it. We haven't called the manufacturer about it. Very unhappy with the &#34;new and improved&#34; version."
8777,"Rembrandt Toothpaste, Intense Stain, Mint Flavor, 3-Ounce Tube",0/0,5.0,"This is the BEST toothpaste I have ever used. Little if any foaming and because I am a tea drinker, it is an awesome stain remover. Would highly recommend it"
8778,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain,1/1,3.0,had to put some foam underneath it to dampen the noise&#8230;It was noisier out of the box than the old pet mate fountain I was using...
8779,Tweezerman Tweezers,0/0,4.0,"I got the yellow the yellow tweezers that are nice and pointed, but the all silver tweezers pictured here are the ultra-pointed/super-sharp ones. I have bought both of these before and they are nice, I was just wanting the ones pictured here, not the ones I got."
8780,Fashy Classic Hot Water Bottle (Assorted Colors) hot water bottle,0/0,4.0,"Great, simple, holds the warmth...does not leak and overall, just a sturdy product. I think the only faux pas was that I ordered one color...and got a different one. But to be honest, I don't care."
8781,Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,0/0,4.0,"Unfortunately, my little girl still only played with the manufacturer's tag! But the quality was good! She did like the inside rattle though!"

8787,Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat,0/0,4.0,"At first I didn't think this booster would be tall enough, it is only 3&#34;...which it didn't say in the description, or I just missed it. But it does work with our table. We have used it for a couple months- it wipes off easy, and doesn't slide off the chair (which were my main concerns with this type of booster seat)."
8788,"Absorbine Jr Pain Relieving Liquid, Original, with No-Mess Applicator - 4 fl oz",0/0,5.0,"I've been using Absrobine Jr. over 20 years, and still an effective pain releiver. Hard to find over the counter, thanks to amazon and found it at a good price. Couldn't be happier. I will definitely recommend this product and the seller."
8789,Playtex Spill-Proof Cup Replacement Valves,0/0,5.0,I used to find these at Target and Walmart but can't find them anymore. Great way to extend the life of our sippy cups!

8791,Garden of Life Primal Defense,0/0,5.0,I use this product every day. It's the best supplement I have found for acid reflux. Don't want to be without.
8792,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,I love this color! I am really glad I decided to get it! I will purchase more Essie products in the future!
8793,Diaper Dude Diaper Bag,0/0,5.0,"It was a gift and the recipient think it's the coolest, as well as useful bag! They love it, so I'm happy!"
8794,Premier Easy Walk Harness,0/0,5.0,"My 75lb dog gets a bit...hyper...when he sees other animals. Not aggressively. More like... &#34;OMG FRIENDS!&#34; So it can be difficult to keep him in check at times when another dog is around. This harness keeps him easily under control. After a couple of uses, he even stopped attempting to pull because he just knew it wouldn't get him anywhere. Perfect."
8795,"Hot Tools -Supertool 2"" Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control",0/0,5.0,"This is a great curling iron. It gets hot very quickly and it makes very lose wavy hair, I am very happy with my purchase."
8796,Philips Norelco HQ6 Replacement Head,0/0,4.0,Very good product. I would recommend it to others who use the Norelco electric razor and want to buy online
8797,Wood Expressions Tournament Chess Set with Black Canvas Bag,0/0,3.0,"The pieces are nice and have enough heft to them. The kit looks cool and travels well. Extra queens are included. Easy to fold up and put away. But as I believe some other reviewers commented, the mat doesn't always stay flat. When we unroll it, it looks a bit dog-eared. Fortunately the pieces are heavy enough to weigh it down, but it doesn't look as good. It meets expectations otherwise. But if someone can point me to a chess set with equally quality pieces and a mat that really goes flat once unrolled, I'd like to hear it."
8798,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,"I have a Nissan 34-ounce stainless steel thermos bottle and it gets real difficult to clean because you can't get your hand inside of it to scrub it. This brush works perfectly for that, highly recommend it for cleaning hard to get to places like thermos's!"
8799,"Energizer Watch/Electronic Batteries, 3 Volts, 2032, 2 batteries (Lithium Button Cell)",0/0,5.0,"I purchased these batteries to replace the one's that were dead inside of my son's headlamp. They work perfectly. True...they don't look like the one's in the picture, they were in a blister pack. They have no expiration date, so i can't tell you if they were expired, but they still work perfectly so I have no complaints especially for the excellent price."
8800,Ezy-Dose Ezy Dose Jumbo Weekly Pill Reminder 2Xl,0/0,2.0,I can't imagine how many pills any single human being could possibly take that would necessitate a dispenser with compartments this big.
8801,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,I got hooked on one of these while watching my grandson who woke up real easy. I slept in the room with him for a month and wanted one when I returned home. I am a light sleeper and my husband snores...this definitely helps.
8802,Glow By Jennifer Lopez For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 1 Ounces,0/0,5.0,I love this perfume. I've bought it over and over again. The smell lasts and my boyfriend complements me every time I wear it.
8803,PetSafe 6-Volt Lithium Battery (2 Batteries per Pack),0/0,3.0,We got the indoor fence system to keep the dog out of a part of the house. We didn't realize that the battery had died until the dog had gone into the off limits area after about three weeks of use. We took the collar off at night but didn't disconnect the battery. So we got this second set of batteries and make a point of disconnecting the batteries when putting the dog to bed.
8804,"Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Victorian Lace Tea, Spa & Treats Clock Gift Chest",0/0,5.0,Liked the box with the clock in it.Will make a nice place for her to keep some little items she is always looking for.Also was surprised at the number of products inside.

8806,CryoDerm Analgesic Cryotherapy 3.0 oz Roll On - Pain Relief,0/0,5.0,"My daughter had some of this when she was visiting me and used it on my sore shoulder, so I purchased some. I had been using bio-freeze and it didn't seem to work anymore. The CryoDerm helps considerably."
8807,DermaVits-90-Capsules-by-NOW,0/0,5.0,"I am prone to break outs and have rosacea and I did not break out with this item. I actually just received my bottle from Amazon. I looked for amino acids for hair growth like Methionine, cystein and more...this product has it all. Combined with BIOTIN- MSM- CYSTEIN...and more. Excellent for hair and nails. I hope it helps my skin as well. Instead of buying all these products separately, this one has them all in one."
8808,"Marina 15 Watt Clear Showcase Bulb, 2-Pack",0/0,5.0,I was happy to find these in a two pack for my small aquariums. They are the perfect size and wattage for my 5 gallon tanks and the two pack makes them very affordable.
8809,Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears,0/0,5.0,"Only Haribo! Any other brand does not compare - either too soft, odd flavors or too greasy. On auto-ship, I'm the best Mom ever!"
8810,Estes 2178 Hi-Flier Flying Model Rocket Kit,0/0,4.0,He's addicted. Fairly easy to assemble with adult help. Fairly easy to recover. Find a big field on a calm day though as this one goes high!
8811,Alex Toys Rub a Dub Squirters for the Tub On the Go Transportation,0/0,5.0,These are great toys for the bath. My son has a few Alex toys. He plays with them all the time.
8812,Jerdon 8-Inch Wall Mount Mirror,0/0,1.0,"The wall mount is cheaply made and one of the bolts attaching the mirror to the mount won't hold. The mirror itself is nice, but it's so not worth what I paid for it...."
8813,Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker,0/0,3.0,My daughter loves the seat!!! But the batteries for the music were dead when product was shipped!!! Had to run out to get batteries because Mia loves music!!!
8814,"Greenies Treat-Pak for Dogs, Original",0/0,4.0,"always a good item. The dogs seem to love them, just wish they were a little bit cheaper to buy"
8815,White Mountain Puzzles Football History,0/0,5.0,"The way the borders work, you can distinctly tell which pieces go to which side so it really made putting the perimeter together a breeze.The main football in the center was also pretty easy to spot so it gave you a good place to work off of early. Overall, we really enjoyed this puzzle."
8816,Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery organizer with Removable Tester,0/0,2.0,"I gave the item 2 stars because it does, indeed hold batteries... although I never took the time to put any in since the tester seems D.O.A., so I'm sending it right back."
8817,Andis 40055 Pro Style 1600 Hair Dryer,0/0,4.0,"Provided it doesn't quit on me as some users have mentioned, I have loved this blow dryer. I used one at a Hilton that was similar, but haven't been able to find the exact same one. This is very close, just not quite as strong, but still worth the price. And it is light enough to dry my hair with a brush and not get a tired arm. I have tennis elbow and this is light enough to not irritate it."
8818,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,4.0,Light and easy to use. Great for the price I paid. Would have like stringer blades though for tough beards
8819,Creased Leather Collar in Burgundy,0/0,4.0,I just received this collar for my 4lb. long-hair chihuahua puppy and we love it. Good quality at a great price.
8820,Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,0/0,5.0,I live in a trailer and we have super tiny rooms. This pail is a life saver. Since I'm a stay at home mom just about all the poops go in here but you can never tell there's a poop in the tiny room because it keeps the smell in so well! Just hold your breath when you go to throw another in and do it fast! When my husband takes the trash out at night he apologizes to me for having to deal with that smell. I let him think that I dealt with that smell all day but really my baby's room is always clean and fresh smelling! Just a tip
8821,THERANEEM MAX CLEANSING BAR,0/0,5.0,"I get patches of eczema under my elbows and knees, and after using this soap for about 6 months I have only needed to use my medicated cream three times (as opposed to every day). I also ate neem pills for awhile but after stopping the pills it doesnt seem to have made much of a difference. This soap on the other hand works wonders for my sensitive skin"
8822,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Doll-House Nursery Room Accessories,0/0,5.0,They look perfect in the dollhouse. My daughter loved it. The items arrived on time. I will definitely recommend it to friends.

8825,Bachmann Trains Snap-Fit E-Z Track Hayes Bumpers (2/card),0/0,5.0,Works as intended on spur track. Bachman is our choice for HO railroading. They produce quality products. At competitive prices
8826,Solgar Advanced Acidophilus Plus Vegetable Capsules,0/0,5.0,I think Solgar makes the best vitamins ever. Their quality is unparalleled and I've never had an issue with their products. I like this because they're easy to swallow and not oversized.
8827,"Aurora Plush 12"" Esmeralda Flopsie",0/0,5.0,"This plush kitty is awesome. We named ours and pretend like it's our child. The face looks a little angry sometimes, but it's so cute and cuddly."
8828,Nicoderm Cq Nicoderm Cq Step 1 Clear Patches,0/0,4.0,"With the 7- and 14-mg patches there was no problem getting them to adhere, but with the larger patches I found myself relying on Band-aids to keep them on throughout the day. That aside, they do work as I'm now 5 months smoke free. It did take a few attempts, but these do work. Stick with it, become smoke free!"
8829,"Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz",1/1,5.0,"We the drinkers of the most delicious and frothy, exclusive tuscan, bovinian fluids, in order to form a more perfect thirst quenching beverage, establish dairy-dominance, insure pasture tranquility, provide for the common cow (colloquially cows), promote the general calcium rich quality, and secure the ensured even and whole percentages of this succulent potable for ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Prime Milking of the Mammary glanduale of the Bos Primigenius."
8830,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,3.0,The do have support but they won't stay up. I have to keep pulling and tugging on them. They would work otherwise.
8831,"KONG Squeaker Tennis Balls Dog Toy, 3-Pack",0/0,5.0,"In reference to the photos of the torn up tennis balls, I say - yes they tear up. But they are inexpensive... and my dog absolutely loves them. So I think of them as consumable dog toys that I will need to restock on once in a while. It is work it to see my dog sqeaking and squeaking and squeaking all day... actually it's too much squeaking! I recommend these regardless of the durability.Also I have a large Akita and it took her several months of chewing before she finally broke into it. I say that's a good deal. But I suppose it depends on the dog. :)"
8832,Hydrocollator Moist Heat HotPac,0/0,3.0,skimpy on filler does not hold heat longer than 15 mins.should add filler and charge more has potential to be great

8835,OUTBURST; with UPDATED TOPICS,0/0,5.0,"We have played this game so many times since receiving it.... it's everyone's favorite for game night!!! Buying one used was definitely the way to go, I saved a lot of money as the new ones are pretty dang pricey for a board game. And the best part is that the game truly was SLIGHTLY used, and in great shape!!! If you don't have this game, don't hesitate to buy it, you won't be sorry! Even had I bought a brand new one at a higher price, I'd not of regretted it. Awesome game!"
8836,"Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment, Vanishing Formula, 0.75 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts. I usually put it on troubled areas every other night, and I've had few breakouts since I started to use this. Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor (Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure), this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I've had without having a prescription. It does make your skin dry"
8837,Wooden Foot Roller Massager,0/0,3.0,This product is just allright. It feels ok but it's not so great that I'm motivated to use it often. It sits under my desk collecting dust.
8838,Devita Natural Skin Care Moroccan Rose Facial Toner,0/0,3.0,Good all natural product. Something new I'm trying after using Guinot Refreshing Toning Lotion for an extended period of time. Not sure how I feel about it quite yet. It's rose smell is much more fragrant than the Guinot yet still refreshing.
8839,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"I received this product a few years ago as a gift. It was amazing. It is great on your face and no greasy feeling. Very subtle smell, if any. Cleans makeup off in a flash, even eye makeup. It does it all and is so gentle on my eyes. Love it, love it, love it!"
8840,ROYAL COPENHAGEN For Men By ROYAL COPENHAGEN Eau De Cologne Spray,0/0,5.0,"My husband has used this fragrance for years and it is one of his favorites. So keep it in your stock, because we will continue to order it."
8841,Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play Playard with Carry Bag,0/0,5.0,"I bought this square pack 'n play for my granddaughter. It is larger than the others and very colorful which makes it more enticing for little ones. Does anyone know if there is a square 2"" mattress for this product?"
8842,Epi-Soothe Oatmeal Shampoo - 16 oz,0/0,5.0,My dog has had itchy skin problems. This shampoo and fish oil has worked well. Smell is clean and neutral.
8843,Hobacare Jojoba 4.22 oz,0/0,4.0,"Why pay more, this stuff is just as good. I purchased this along with another brand that was more expensive.They both work the same."
8844,Jason Body Care Satin Shower Body Wash,0/0,5.0,If you have skin irritations or sensitive skin you will love this product! There is no extra scents or extra anything added and you can tell. It is just simple bare soap.
8845,Tape Worm Tabs for Cats (3 tablets),0/0,5.0,"My cat had those creepy crawlies, but gave him this and &#34;no mas.&#34; I guess they only get worms when they are kittens, because as an adult, he has not had this problem anymore. He just farts a lot (stinky farts), I guess I have to add more fiber to his diet."
8846,Bigelow Tea (6 Pack),0/0,5.0,"I love iced tea year round, and my favorite is orange spiced tea. In this class of teas Bigelows Constant Comment is without equal. The flavors are very well balanced, and the foil seal pack flavor is an added benefit. Please don't stop making this tea. And buying in bulk through Amazon makes it cost effective."
8847,Doctors Best Comprehensive Prostate Formula,0/0,5.0,My husband tries to keep up with staying healthy and this is a product that can help with that. This has been his first bottle and so far we think it is having a positive effect.
8848,Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men's Body Wash 18 Fl Oz (Pack of 6),0/0,5.0,Great soap. Still washing all my smelly parts with it! I would purchase again for sure. Hope you enjoy yours.
8849,MalleoTrain Ankle Support,0/0,5.0,I wear one of these everyday. The added padding over the tendon areas makes a big difference as opposed to just a stretch support with no padding. It keeps down the swelling. Is comfortable. I wear 2 pr of socks. One under it and one over so that it won't irritate my skin and stays cleaner. The wearing of 2 pr of socks adds to the comfort. Even wearing on a daily basis I had 2 other pairs that I altered wearing so that one could be washed while wearing the other and these lasted 10 yrs. They have lost elasticity so are not as snug but are still intact and useful.
8850,Nad's Hair Removal Gel Kit 6 oz. Gel And Accessories,1/1,5.0,"I'll be using Nad's for the rest of my life, it works so well for waxing my legs and is so easy to use. I have annoyingly coarse, thick hair on my legs & have to shave every day, yep, major pain. Nads just rips the hair right out at the root (I know, sounds painful & it is somewhat but it's worth it to me & you just get used to it), then I don't have to wax again for 2 weeks or more. But the bad thing is you have to let the hair grow fully before waxing, that kinda sucks. Won't work very well to wax short stubble, at least not for me. The wax is so easy to prepare, I just stick the jar in a shallow bowl of hot water, don't let the water get into the jar. Then smooth a thin layer of wax on an area of your leg the size of one of the strips, smooth it on in the direction of the hair growth. Then press it on & tear it off in the opposite direction. Voila, silky smooth. And when you're all done with a leg, the wax just washes right off with warm water, such easy clean up. It's not even really like a wax consistency, more like a thick, clear, green gel. Has a subtle smell, nothing bad. All natural ingredients, another bonus. Here's a tip too...the fabric strips that come with the package are ok but they just don't give you enough. What I do is cut up an old pair of jeans into strips, and a couple inches longer than the ones they give you. Denim fabric works perfect and they stand up well thru washing, the edges will fray but that doesn't matter. I soak them a few minutes in a bucket with warm water to loosen the wax before throwing in the washing machine. Please Nad's people, never stop making this stuff!!!"
8851,"Bayer K9 Advantix II Red, 21-55lbs. 12 Month Supply Flea & Tick",0/0,5.0,So far it has worked for me. More powerful than Frontline. Simple easy to use. Fast delivery. Make sure you put it on the dog's skin.
8852,Pure Instinct Pheromone Cologne,1/1,3.0,I liked the smell but all of the other reviews were correct...doesn't last very long. Probably won't go to the trouble to buy it again.
8853,"Megafood - Men's One Daily, 90 tablets",0/0,5.0,"I don't necessarily notice a difference when I've been taking these, but I don't think you do with any multivitamin. The point is I'm getting more of the things my body needs and its from real food."
8854,Bio Kleen Oxygen Bleach Plus,0/0,5.0,"This stuff works so well on my laundry, that I started using it for cleaning stubborn stains around the house (in the carpet shampooer, washing away mildew in the shower, cleaning dog doodie area in the back yard, etc) but even if you only use it for laundry, you'll be SO glad you tried it. It works WAY BETTER than bleach ever did, without the harsh wear and tear on your clothes. I've removed stains that I thought would NEVER come clean by making a paste and putting that paste directly the stain for a few hours before washing.... this method removed both coffee and lipstick stains that had already been washed AND DRIED into the fabric! It's unbelievable that it works so well, and nobody seems to know about it. But one thing is for sure... I'll never use anything other than this bleach!"

8856,Carex Universal Bath Bench with Back,0/0,5.0,Everything about this product is great. Fits well in tub and the large seat is really good. I would recommend this product to anyone that is in need of a bath chair.

8858,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,0/0,5.0,"In the past had the Litter Maid brand; always had problems. This litter box had worked efficiently from the beginning. There was no need to meld the litter from the old box to this new one. Our cat went immediately to the new ScoopFree box when we threw out the old, standard litter box. We have noticed that this box is much cleaner. Also enjoying the &#34;visit&#34; counter."

8861,Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes,1/1,2.0,"For 9 months, we loved Seventh Generation Free & Clear Baby Wipes. My son did not get diaper rash and the wipes were the perfect consistency between soft and moist. In my latest order, the package touted a new and improved wipe that was softer, etc. We found quite the opposite with the wipe being too wet and too hard. My son then started getting diaper rash so we had to stop using the wipe. I am really hoping they either go back to their old formula or tweak the new one. Until that happens, I have sadly stopped using the Seventh Generation wipes."
8862,Fake Bake Tanning Lotion Self Tanner 6 Oz,0/0,5.0,"I have used many self tanners and even spray tanning booths. This product by far gives the most natural look when used properly. Always use the gloves that come with lotion and rub in until even then wipe areas that tend to 'collect' self tanner, knees, elbows, etc.Do not be afraid of how 'dark' lotion appears, it just helps so you can see it as you apply it!"
8863,Drakkar Noir Eau de Toilette,0/0,4.0,"They were not for me. My guy friend wanted it for his birthday and he loved it. He probably would have given the product a five but in my opinion the smell is a little strong and if you're a guy you should take that into consideration if you intend to smell good to other women. lol But other than that, my guy friends seem to like it."
8864,Cloud b Sound Machine Soother,0/0,2.0,I was so excited when I got this in the mail and opened it right away to put it in my nursery. The little music box didn't fit into the pocket space provided in the giraffe and because of that I ended up ripping the hardly sown on velcro strap. =(

8867,Nature's Way Alive!,0/1,1.0,"These pills are so huge that I almost choked on them -- twice. The recommended dose is two. After a couple of days of dreading swallowing these enormous odd-smelling vitamins, I bagged it. If you are an older person, or if you have a normal sized throat, I would advise caution in attempting to swallow these bad boys. If you have an enormous gullet, go for it."
8868,Kinesio Tex Tape,0/0,1.0,"Last year I purchased s similar tape in blue and a different brand and it was fanastic!! I chose this brand because it had more reviews and an extra 1/2 star than the other tape that I loved, so I went with this. Bad decision!!! IT IS AWFUL and won't stay on!!!!!!!"

8872,Sam's Yams Veggie Rawhide Sweet Potato Dog Treats,0/0,3.0,"The dogs love them, and I like that they won't stain carpet or furniture. But it takes my dogs seconds to go through these, so calling them &#34;chews&#34; seems a bit of a stretch."

8877,"Kong Catnip Cat Toy, Squirrel",0/0,5.0,I purchased 2 Kong Catnip Squirrels in 2010. I have 5 cats ranging in ages from 4 to 18 years. My 6 year-old male orange tabby adopted both squirrels as soon as I placed them on the floor. He does not allow the other cats to play with them. He carries them around in his mouth and talks to them. He carries them to only certain places in the house away from the other cats. He even brings them to bed at night with him. It is the most adorable site to see. I recommend these adorable squirrels to any cat owner; enjoy the fun!
8878,Paula Dorf Lip Color Sheer Tint SPF 15,0/0,5.0,"This lipstick goes on so smoothly and is just what I was looking for. Most lipsticks go on too dark, even the lighter shades and look unnatural on me. This is perfect ... enough for a little color, but not overwhelming."
8879,Nylabone Rhino Bone Chew Toy,0/0,3.0,My dog (american bulldog) has chewed on these since he was a puppy. This one was down to a nub within 2 weeks. They typically last longer but this one did not. Very disappointing since I have to spend $20 each time and I can't find them locally.

8882,SPENCO Gel Insole,0/0,5.0,These are very nice. I was on my feet a lot at my last job. I tried half a dozen insoles in the $20-30 price range and always had foot pain in the morning until I tried these. I found these to have better arch support and better cushioning particularly on the balls of the feet and heels compared to much more expensive Dr. Scholl's insoles.

8884,"Fluval Peat Granules, 500 Gram/17.6 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I had tried a number of other products like API's water softener pillow to lower the hardness of my tank and never had much success. The hardness of my tank was incredibly hard (both kh and gh) and the ph always hovered in the basic range despite attempting to put more drift wood in to lower it. I finally tried these peat granuals (I got one of the mesh bags and put about half of this box in that bag and into my canister filter). Within perhaps a week or two, it had brought both hardnesses and ph down to ideal readings for my tropical community tank. I am not overly averse to using chemicals to treat a tank if it's what works best, but this just had that Occam's Razor feel that it was 1) Natural, 2) Relatively cheap and 3) Incredibly effective! This has certainly found a permanent place in my filter!"
8885,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,"This is a very pretty color that will look great on any skin tone. I honestly bought it because I heard this was the color Kate Middleton wore on her wedding day. I purchased it here because it was cheaper than in stores, and I couldn't find it in any stores! I'm glad I got this shade that I can wear and I know where I can buy another bottle when I run out of this shade."

8888,"Bowsers Double Donut Dog Bed in Milano Microvelvet (Milano, Medium (35in x 27in))",0/0,2.0,"I can tell this is a good bed, but the way it was shipped was not! I have had the bed for over a week and it still is misshaped. As my dog curls up in is he slowly starts to slid out of it due to the miss sharpen issue. I have attempted to stand on it to have it hold its shape but at the moment, I am using a wall to help prop it up to support the weight of my dog."

8891,Heather's Tummy Fiber POUCH Organic Acacia 16 oz. for Irritable Bowel Syndrome,0/0,5.0,"My wife has been using this for over 3 years now. She was diagnosed with Lymphocytic colitis. Diarrhea at any time of day.....did not matter what she ate. Doctor gave her all kinds of different meds...none really worked and the ones that helped a little gave her bad side effects (achy, headaches, etc.)A friend told her about this product. After about 2 weeks, everything started working right! She was so excited. Now it is 3 years later, she doesn't have to use it all the time anymore. But every once in a while, her stomach acts up, and whether is is constipation or diarrhea, this stuff works! That is all I can say.Give it a try. It's actually cheaper to buy it on Amazon that directly from her website....at least the last time I checked. Go figure!?"

8894,Farouk CHI 1 Inch Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron,1/1,1.0,"I bought this item to replace my previous chi which had broke. When I received this item, it looked exactly like my old one except it wouldn't even turn on!! I plugged it in and the red light would only come on every once in while, making it impossible for the iron to even heat up!! It seems to be getting worse day by day, if that's even possible. I've tried contacting the seller several times, it's been about a couple weeks and still no reply. I'm in the process of filing a claim with Amazon. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this item!! Spend a little extra on the authentic ones in the store, it's worth it!!"
8895,Melissa & Doug Stack and Sort Board,0/0,5.0,"I love how many different things it teaches from colors, shapes, counting, and stacking. It is a great learning toy that kids of many ages enjoy!"
8896,Smoke Fluid/Track Cleaner,0/0,4.0,It smells pretty bad -- not like the old smoke I had as a kid. It's possible that I might have a problem in my engine because I didn't get billows of smoke -- more like wisps. You don't need much though.
8897,Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Meat Magic,0/0,3.0,"Ok if your, 'not sure what to use,' would be my best description. There is no catch all, 'meat,' seasoning. Lots have tried and I guess this is as good or better than some. You may find it more to your taste that mine and truly find it Magic. For instance I really like Poultry Magic and give it five stars."

8903,Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears,0/0,5.0,"The only drawback so far is that, if you simply open the bag and leave these out, I eat them TOO quickly. So I split them up into several canister and put them in the cabinets.Always loved them, since I was a kid and they were a delicacy."
8904,Three Bears Family Pattern Cards; 16 Cards Per Pack; no. LER0753,0/0,2.0,"I wish this came with its own bears, it would have made it easier. Its a good learning tool just needs to come in a full set"
8905,ADC ADSCOPE 603 Stainless Stethoscope,0/0,4.0,"I purchased this stethoscope as a &#34;bargain&#34; scope to leave at my grandmothers so I could listen to her and check her BP, and I didn't always have my Stethoscope handy, I was pleased with the quality of this scope it had a great weight to it, the tubing was very strong, it had great sounds too it, if you need just a basic stethoscope for basic assessments this is a great tool, and you could skip the expensive brand."

8909,Hartz Chew N' Clean Dental Bone,0/0,1.0,"I had high hopes for this teeth cleaning ""bone"", but after a few weeks my 50lb. border collie was able to turn the ends from smooth to very sharp numerous spikes. Not only did it seems these spikes would pierce his gums, but some of the pieces were missing and they could only go one place, his stomach. I expected a better design from Hartz."

I purchased this at my local CVS for $8 and its ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I have thin blonde hair which I color and highlight often. This past treatment, my hair started to really break off. I used a small amount everyday for a week and its like my hair was renewed!

8919,Four Paws Cotton Web Lead,0/0,5.0,This lead worked the best for walking my dog in a city. I could stop and let her sniff the grass and shrubs and let the lead out as she went without worrying about her getting away. The cotton is easily held and I washed the lead a few times by hand when it got noticeably dirty.
8920,Pampers Swaddlers,0/0,4.0,I have used both Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry for my newborn. I have never had a leak with Swaddlers (with Baby Dry newborn liquid poop often shot right up the back of the diaper and onto baby's outfit) and the same size in the Swaddler style seems to be a lot roomier than the Baby Dry style. There is a slim indicator strip on the front of the diapers to indicate whether they are wet inside but to be honest by the time I have taken pants off or opened up the onesie to allow me to see the indicator I am already pretty much clear the diaper is wet. One complaint is that the top layer of the inside of the diaper has netting that wicks away moisture (to avoid leaks and keep baby's bottom dry) but also serves to dry poop bits which makes them stick to baby's butt. Cleaning takes more time because you aren't just wiping; you are also scrubbing dried poop bits.
8921,Irwin Naturals Ginko Smart,0/0,3.0,"After only a week, I clearly noticed a memory improvement. But Darn! I am also allergic to one of the ingredients because it caused a rash on both sides of my torso. It took a while to clear up after I discontinued. So now I'm trying out Standard Poors Ginko version -- so far no rash :)"
8922,Pacific Health Accelerade,0/0,5.0,"It gets the job done; it's a perfect &#34;recovery drink&#34; after a heavy workout. I believe it's been endorsed by Mark Sisson, the &#34;Primal Diet&#34; guy. I prefer to mix a full scoop with only 4-6 oz of water because it tastes too weak and diluted otherwise."
8923,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I heavily researched what's out there and am glad I decided on the Remington MB-200. It's strong and fast, and makes it an ease to switch between settings. If you like simple and strong at a reasonable price, this is a good one to buy."
8924,Mattress Genie Bed Lift System,0/0,5.0,"I need to be elevated because of indigestion ... we have two twin mattresses that serve as a king bed (by design, as we like it different softnesses.) I ordered the mattress genie....I am absolutely delighted with it. It works exactly as advertised, and was so so simple to set up. I am so glad that I ordered it."
8925,Melissa & Doug English Bulldog - Plush,0/0,3.0,"I bought this for my 6-yr old and she was really excited. The confirmation email gave a a large delivery window of when I should expect the product. I never got a tracking number, confirmation of shipment, etc. so I had no way of knowing when to expect it aside from the 7-day window. Each day my daughter would ask if we received it, and each day I would tell her it would be here by the last day of the delivery window. Once the window had past and we still hadn't received the product, my daughter was very disappointed & I had no way of knowing when the item would arrive. Luckily, the item finally arrived 2 days later than the delivery window b/c I was about to cancel my order. When I received it, the box was completely demolished and looked like it had been poorly packed in an undersized box and run over by a truck. Fortunately, the stuffed animal was not damaged. Overall, the product was what we expected but the fact that the delivery was unpredictable and late made for a poor buying experience."

8929,Small World Living Toys My-Oh-My Pizza Pie,0/0,5.0,"There is some fundamental appeal to this well made &#34;play food&#34; pizza. Our daughter got one as a gift, and all her playmates enjoyed it. The boys did too. After thousands of &#34;servings&#34; the pizza was passed on to a kindergarten class still in great condition. It's not cheap, but it is very well made and keeps its appearance and the velcro adhesion between the pieces.We bought one for our neighbor's kids who just got a play kitchen. We hear it gets a lot of use. This is one of those simple, classic toys that has great appeal. No batteries required!"
8930,PetSafe SunBlock Top for PetSafe Kennels,0/0,3.0,Great cover for dog run but the zip ties that came w/it were so old and brittle they just snapped as I tried to use them!

I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years. My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft. My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right. The retractable cord is great. And, I love the folding handle for travel."
8935,"Nature's Path Organic Instant Hot Oatmeal Pouch Original, 14-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)",1/1,1.0,"There must be something wrong with these. The nutrition facts say there is only 120 mg of sodium, but I just threw out what I had left, couldn't eat it anymore. I can't really describe how salty this is, but it is really like someone dumped a entire shaker in each bowl. Real Bad. Whole Foods 365 brand is the way to go. Same price, no salty taste."
8936,"2007 George Washington Presidential $1 Coin - First President, 1789-1797",0/0,4.0,This artist did a much better job with the Washington likeness than lots of the others did. A great start but some are just not that great. You gotta have them all though.

8944,"Spicy World Citric Acid, 5-Pound",0/0,5.0,"My hot water dispenser (Zojirushi) had a lot of water deposit buildup. Citric acid to the rescue! I poured about 3/4 cups of citric acid into the water inside. Stirred it thoroughly then boiled it. Waited an hour. Then I dispensed all of it so that it went thru the tubing. The leftover smell after it was empty wasn't appealing so I refilled it with plain water, boiled it and dispensed it all again. No more smell or buildup. I also used it on my son's sink which had lots of buildup and soaked it for an hour. Buildup all gone. Worked also on all the toliets in the house. I keep it stored in a container to keep it fresh. Some of it was a bit clumped but only a tiny amount. See my photos. Really worth the money."
8945,Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway - Drawbridge,0/0,5.0,"All my 4 year old grandson wanted for Christmas was this drawbridge.He talked about it, drew pictures about it, and it was the only thing heasked from Santa. I didn't even try to find it in stores, I went directlyto the internet. The drawbridge, made by Learning Curve is quality built, easilyadapts to the Thomas the Train wooden tracks, and the bridge works perfectly every time.The drawbridge was the first gift he opened, and the only toy he played with onChristmas day."
8946,Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard,0/0,5.0,"I love this product. It tastes amazing, and I know there won't be any clumps. 15-20 seconds worth of mixing in a shaker cup and I know I'll be good to go. The best part about this protein is I don't have to worry if I'm out of milk, as it still tastes just as good when using water only."
8947,Uncle Goose Classic Embossed Alphabet Blocks ABC,0/0,5.0,"We have gotten a lot of use out of these blocks. From the time our son could set up, he used to play with these just because they have nice bright colors on them and you can throw them against each other and generally play. When he started to learn the alphabet, it has become just as fun for him to play with these because he loves to spell his name, find numbers and letters that he knows, while he's building roads and castles, etc., with these blocks.I love that they are wood and I don't have to worry about all those plastic chemicals in these. And he's certainly learning while building. A great, great product. Love it!"

8952,"Huggies Pull-Ups Cool Alert Training Pants, Girls",0/0,3.0,"I love the convenience of Pull-up and that I can get the Cool Alert version on subscribe and save, but I am disappointed that the Cool Alert doesn't always work however more than that they removed the extra velcro safety tab on the sides of the pull-up. Having those tabs made it easy and convenient to change it in public. You could roll all the items into the pull-up and use the tab on the side to hold it all closed. Made for less mess and easier to locate a trash can with if you weren't able to use a restroom for changes. Also made it harder for active children to accidently have their pull-ups open on the sides due to rubbing on clothing. The price is also a little higher than I like. In face it is high enough that occassionally when Kmart, Target or Toysrus have diaper sales it's cheaper, even with tax, to get it from there. I do prefer pull-ups over diapers after a certain age and when wanting trying to introduce potty training and sometimes the Cool Alert version assists a child in realizing they really don't want to sit in wet diapers."
8953,Munchkin Three Stay Put 3-Pack Suction Bowl,0/0,3.0,"These little bowls are adorable, but I found that the suction is not strong enough to stop my baby from pulling them up and making a mess anyway. We still us them and they make good snack containers too."
8954,Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Lotion,0/0,5.0,"it was a bit more expensive than lubriderm, but I was able to get free shipping with prime so decided to try it. It is really thick and doesn't feel like it leaves a residue like some do. So far, I love it."

At first i thought maybe I was forgetting to eat with it...but then I ate big meals with it AND STILL I WOULD GET REALLY SICK AND THROW UP FOR LIKE 1 HOUR.
8959,Puzzled Tyrannosaurus Woodcraft Construction Kit,0/0,5.0,My 5 year old had a project for Kindergarten on T-Rex's and they were asked to make some form of model. This was perfect where as clay was too easy and breakable and paper mache would've been too hard for her. it is also pretty durable!

8967,Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester,0/0,1.0,"The male/female-shaped pieces which are supposed to ""click"" together didn't. I was unable to do a reading at all. If you try to hold it in place and keep it there without the click, it squeezes shut when you gently pull it off your skin. Or opens if your grip is too gentle. If it clicked it would be fine, I'm sure. Without the click, it's a piece of plastic."
8968,Cover Girl Volume Exact Mascara Mascara,0/0,4.0,"I love playing up my eyes, but sometimes I don't want to be too obvious. This is nice for some volume and color without the &#34;loo at me!&#34; of some formulas. The brush is okay, but can lead to clumping if you don't wipe off the excess first."
8969,EAS Myoplex Lite Nutrition Shake,0/0,5.0,The only mix I'll purchase. Convenient serving size packaging. Great taste & texture even mixed alone with water. Low calories compared to others.
8970,Freeman Freeman Facial Clay Mask Feeling Beautiful Avocado & Oatmeal,0/0,5.0,"I am so happy with this purchase. I did not have bad skin to begin with, I just get the occasional bad breakout on my chin or nose and have some lightly visible dark pores in those areas. After having just used this product twice (once on a Sunday and then later on Wednesday) I could already tell a difference. My pores are smaller/invisible and my skin is very soft. As an added bonus, I keep getting compliments from my boyfriend on how great my skin smells after I use it.I did not purchase this item from Amazon, it was half the price at Schnucks (I was shocked too) and I didn't have to do that annoying $25 thing that Amazon is now pushing.The only draw back so far is that my skin seems slightly drier but it is winter and that's normal for me so I'll have to wait and see what happens in a few months but this is definitely something I will purchase again and again!"
8971,"West Paw Design Zogoflex Dog Toy, Hurley, Large (Colors Vary)",0/0,4.0,"my dog eats and destroys everything. this toy actually survives him.he is not infatuated with it and gets bored after a few minutes, but it lasts through his aggressive chewing habits, which none of his others toys can."

8977,"Jergens Age Defying Multi-Vitamin Lotion, 16.8 Ounce",0/0,4.0,"Emollient lotion which absorbs quickly and is not greasy for my acne-prone skin. However, unlike others have commented, the scent is too overpowering for me. My mom on the other hand loves it, and added bonus, that it's packed with vitamins. I will stick with my beloved Curel lotion, which is also price greatly on Amazon."
8978,NatraBio Adrenal Support,0/0,4.0,I've long had a bit of adrenal insufficiency. This product definitly seems to boost adrenal function when taken as directed.
8979,"Futuro Sport Deluxe Ankle Stabilizer, One Size Adjustable (Pack of 2)",0/0,5.0,Great product! I fell and hurt my knee and sprained ankle on same leg in April 2012. Dr. gave me some blow up junk and it hurt without stability. Went back to this one. Wore it up until I was released from PT in Oct. 2012. 5 stars all around. Carry one with me at all times! Grace is not my name!!!
8980,Zoya Nail Polish,0/0,5.0,"This is one of my very favorite polishes, and I do own many others! The Zoya brand is a low-toxicity nail polish formula, at an affordable price. It applies super smoothly and dries quickly to a shiny finish. This color &#34;Dove&#34; is perfectly named... its a lovely light gray... not quite as light as a true whitish &#34;pastel&#34; gray, but light enough to give a very &#34;fresh and clean&#34; look to the nails, if that's what you're after. It's a full coverage &#34;cream&#34; formula that takes two substantial coats to reach opague coverage. This shade of gray is neither super warm (brownish) nor supper cool (bluish)... to my eye it's a &#34;neutral&#34; gray, so I imagine it would flatter a wide vairety of skin tones, and go with most outfits. I have very fair skin with warm (yellow) undertones. There is no shimmer to the color, but it's nice and luminous. I'd say this color is office appropriate as well, for all but super conservative settings. To me the color says &#34;modern and hip and creative&#34; yet also &#34;reserved and elegant.&#34; I'm really fond of shades like this, that manage to be off beat without being wild or tacky. This shade will get your hands noticed though, so make sure your nails and cuticles are well manicured before applying, clean up any mistakes with a polish corrector, and apply hand cream after the polish dries. I used a good base and top coat as well (Opi &#34;Start to Finish&#34;). My husband really loves this color on me, and he's usually not one to comment on my nail polish. Enjoy it!"

8985,Wooden Foot Roller Massager,0/0,4.0,"I like how it made my feet feel, the only downside to it was that I felt like I should be able to roll both of my feet at the same time, but the two sides are a bit too close together to do that comfortably. They were quite inexpensive as well, and they are well made too."
8986,Safety 1st Clear View Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,0/0,2.0,"Both base and cover are plastic, held together by a sturdy metal pin which acts as a hinge. Problem is that the pin is way sturdier than the plastic it's mounted in. I have 4 of these, and 2 are broken"

8988,FURminator deShedding Tool,0/0,4.0,We recently adopted a pug mix who shed a lot this winter. I thought I'd try this. He is not a fan of brushing but I got a TON of hair the first couple times. Now I have less loose hair in the house and weekly brushing has kept it in check. We are all happy. No magic like in the video but he has short hair and it really works nicely.

8990,Prince Of Peace Tea Premium,0/0,1.0,"It's not that complicated, I brewed this tea and it had a very strong, moldy dirt smell that was a big turn-off. I tasted it nonetheless, and guess what? It tasted like dirt too. This isn't the very worst of it. The worst of it all is that the seller doesn't accept refunds. So I'm stuck with this dirt-tea which is pretty much useless to me. I was satisfied with Prince of Peace's Oolong tea though."
8991,Mini Non-Locking Hemostat for Ear Care,0/0,5.0,i love this product. Its very helpful and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer. Thank you
8992,Bubble-Wall Bendable Air Diffusers for Aquariums,0/0,5.0,"When my first bendable bubble wand broke after about 10 years of use, I purchased aMarineland PA0548F Flexible Bubble Wand with Anti-siphon Valve, 48-Inch. I couldn't get it to produce the volume of bubbles I wanted so I went back to the black ones and purchased the Penn Plax bubble wand.This one produced more bubbles from the start but requires a regular scrubbing to remove stuff that clogs the porous surface. I use some really stiff filter media to scrub it but I saw where someone else uses a brush. Because I clean my aquarium every two weeks, I have no problem with the wand producing less bubbles.I also have tried a multitude of pumps with diffuser but theMillion Air Pump 600is the strongest and, by far, the quietest.I tried to take a photo of the bubbler but the fish kept getting in the way. Posted a pretty sorry one anyway."
8993,Uncle Milton Moon In My Room,0/0,5.0,Its fun and the moon phases are a great beginning astronomy lesson. My grand daughter likes it as a nite light
8994,Nature's Way Fennel Seed,0/1,1.0,"The fennel seed might have been nice, if I'd ever received it. It took 14 days to get the wrong product, and then I was told I had to pay over the price of the product to send what they had sent me back to get the right one sent. So I just tossed the unusable pills they sent and went and bought what I wanted at a nearby store."
8995,"Tinkle Eyebrow Shaper, 3pk",0/0,2.0,for what I wanted (on my face) this is no better than a razor. don't waste your time. hard to get it at the right angle.

8999,Toysmith Pustefix Bubble Blowing Bear (Colors may vary),0/0,3.0,I bought this because I could not find the nos pill anywhere else and my grandson loves bubbles. Then after I bought it and it leaked some I found one exactly the same that did not leak for five dollars less.
9000,"Reach Toothbrush, Full Head, Firm, Value Pack 2 toothbrushes (Colors May Vary)",0/0,5.0,"some people don't like FIRM, but I do! I have 4 toothbrushes and I rotate them, so 4 usually last me a whole year. Every year I buy 4 more. PLEASE don't stop making them, Reach!"
9001,Dinosaur Paint&Play Set 1,0/0,2.0,The paint chips away very quickly and you dont have enough of it for a double coat. But my kids love the shapes and I mixed the white and red to make pink so my daughter could have pink dinosaurs for her birthday. Over all it's fun for them and I just think its a bit more expensive than it should be and that you should buy your own modeling paint to go with it.
9002,Crunchie Milk Chocolate with Honeycomb Center - Pack of 6 Bars,1/1,5.0,"I loves the chocolate bars. I do not like Cadbury USA chocolate, but the UK chocolate is great. I cannot find Violet Crumble anywhere so this is my go to replacement. The honeycomb is nice and the bars arrived fresh and unmelted."
9003,Ravensburger Penguin Pile - Up - Children's Game,0/0,4.0,"We've played this with our 7 and 12 year olds and had many laughs. It's a simple concept, the penguins are cute and it's always fun to see who will create the biggest penguin spill! You do need a decent level of dexterity, so kids under 5 or 6 may get frustrated. Overall, lots of fun!"
9004,Rainbow Light Just Once Iron-Free,0/0,5.0,"I was taking Centrium crap. One day I decided to do some research and found out how much crap they put into cheap supplements. So I decide to go the ""organic"" route. These are easy on the stomach and has quality ingredients. While I realize I should try harder to get nutrients from a proper diet,it's good knowing that these are helping with what's missing."
9005,Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug,0/0,5.0,We bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She is going to be 5 in a few months & this little wheely bee is still going strong. Both my almost 5 and almost 3 year olds still fit on it and ride it almost on a daily basis. A great toy to have you have a smooth surface for riding!

9010,Paris Hilton Fragrances - Just Me Men Spray,0/0,5.0,"Just like all of Paris Hilton's colognes for men, it smells great! I am sure many people won't give them a try since her name is on it, but they are missing out! I get compliments by everyone when I wear this and especially from the one in the blue bottle."
9011,Conair HS28X Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter,0/0,4.0,"This is more intended for pack and travel....very cute. However, I have lots of thick hair. Could use a couple extra rollers. Does not get as hot as I am accustomed to, but works just the same."
9012,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Fruit Salad, 5-Pound Bag",0/0,5.0,"This is a delicious Haribo product with nice fruity flavors. The only thing that would make it better is if they added the pink grapefruit to the mix, which is still our favorite."

9015,NOW Foods Tea Tree Oil,0/0,5.0,"I bought this because I think I unleashed dust mites in the house after buying 2 bath rugs from Wal-Mart without washing them first. I mixed this into a spray bottle with drinking water and sprayed the heck out of my linens, mattress, carpet (it was my first parasite experience and I was freaked like you wouldn't believe). I poured way more than just 20 drops into the streaming bathtub, about an ounce each day for 3 days and the pest was eradicated. my house smelled wonderful and so did I every night before going to bed after a long, hot soak. I almost forgot the pleasant warmth and gentle lapping of water that can only be enjoyed by taking a bath... Thank you mites, but good riddance."
9016,Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W,0/0,1.0,I unfortunately bought this somewhere else but it is worthless!! Wish I had read the reviews first..like everyone else it didn't keep a charge and now won't recharge. About 4 months for me..do not waste your money!
9017,"Horizon Organic Low Fat Milk, Vanilla, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)",0/0,4.0,"Do you know how much a dairy cow weighs on average? How many gallons of water a cow drinks in a single day? You would if you got this Horizon Organic milk.I have a passion for all things drinkable with a straw right out of the pouch, mostly because it saves me from having to creatively squeeze in yet another dirty glass to the pile of dishes already waiting in my sink. This straw that is included in every pouch is this milk's biggest asset, second only to its rich vanilla taste, of course.Nothing like sitting down to watch some News on TV on a saturday morning, with a plate of scrambled eggs in one hand and this 8 oz pack of low fat vanilla milk in the other. You just stick the straw in and enjoy the deliciousness. The rectangular thick paper pouch is just big enough for a nice, easy hold. You feel good holding it, like when you wrap your fingers around the iPhone, or when you hold a handyman's driller or something. Then you take a sip through the straw and you quickly transform into an adult kid of sorts.I get my boxes from Costco. They are cheaper in bulk, of course. They have it in chocolate and strawberry flavors but I always get the Vanilla kind, I don't know why. I do want to try the other flavors though. It is organic milk but frankly, you can't tell if it tastes different from the regular, non-organic milk because of its vanilla flavor or inherent richness. And it's already sweetened so I wouldn't recommend using this milk with cereal that already has some sugar in it. But I do have another way you can enjoy this milk. As a dessert, no less!Pour one pouch of this milk into your ice cube tray. Sprinkle some walnuts and pistachios and dig in a toothpick. 2 hours later, you have yourself a nice frozen treat. Kids will love it too.Judging by the package design, I suppose you would say it's kids' milk. But do you really care? It tastes good, is nutritious enough and quenches your thirst, whether you are young or old. So cheers...to the little kid in all of us."
9018,"Emu Gold All Natural Emu Oil Extra Strength Ultra Active, 2 fl oz by ClubNatural",0/0,1.0,"All I'll say is that I like the product but will never order it from 911 again.

9020,"Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce",0/0,5.0,"i am 58 years old and my hands were so ugly. i was desperate to find a product that would prevent me from putting my hands in my mouth. this problem was so way beyond just nail bitting and had progressed to cuticles and beyond. i was a nervous wreck that couldn't stop.i researched many products online before making a decision.the mavala stop arrived 4 days after purchase. the fact that i did not have to pay sales tax was a bonus too!i applied the polish immediately to my nails and cuticles and waited for what was next.of course at some point in time, my fingers were in my mouth and my taste buds were instantly assaulted by the most foul, bitter taste ever. do not be fooled and compare this bitter taste to a lemon, lime or bad pickle. this stuff makes you want to run for anything that will get the taste out of your mouth NOW. just a head's up....water won't do it.it has been 5 days since my first application which i reapply everyday to keep the taste as disgusting as possible. in less than 1 weeks time, my nails have improved beyond belief! i actually have white at the end of my nail beds again and the skin on my fingers is starting to heal.i think 1 bottle of this product will be enough. all i have to do is look at the box and cringe!instead of avoiding jewelry that might draw attention to my hands, i am looking forward to a manicure next month."

9025,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Classic Peg Puzzle Bundle,0/0,5.0,These puzzles are good for young kids. The only thing that would make them better is if the holes where they belong we're the exact shape of the letter or number. This would help them more easily recognize where each piece belongs.
9026,Aromafloria Stress Less Inhalation Beads Lavender Chamomile and Sage,0/0,4.0,"It was a reasonable price, had a wonderful aroma and was definitely stress relieving. I bought three of them as gifts."

9028,NOW Foods Lavender Oil,0/0,5.0,"The NOW brand is reputable and this lavender essential oil is the genuine thing from what I can tell. It has the aroma of lavender, and the label has it at 100% pure. It should be used with caution as it is genuine essential oil. I use it for my hair scalp treatments and for migraine headaches. Works great!"

9032,Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges,0/0,2.0,I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.
9033,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,2.0,The baby dry diaper is not as good as swaddlers for leakage proof performance. It leaks quite frequently from the back side. One reason may be that my baby has some gas issue. But the swaddlers worked much better to prevent leakage by adding thicker layer on the back. I should have bought it even with the little additional cost. So be warned if you do not want to wash baby cloth that often.
9034,"Minoxidil-5% Extra Strength Hair Regrowth for Men, 3 Count, 2 Ounce Bottles",0/0,5.0,"cannot beat the price, have used for years, seems to help hair but wish there was something stronger but equal to non generic minoxidil"

But that's OK - when my husband sprays it on, I don't need the scent hours from then...because I'll have already enjoyed it!I know this sounds a little extreme, so here's my evidence"

9043,"100% Whey, Chocolate Mint 5 lb",0/0,5.0,"Not much to this really, just straight up whey protein with amino acids. The Vanilla flavor is pretty good. I usually put a scoop in a shake with berries and peanut butter. If I'm short on time I just stir it in a small glass of water (too much will dilute the flavor). I was skeptical of getting into the world of supplements, but this is a pretty &#34;vanilla&#34; form of it."
9044,"Scotch-Brite Disposable Toilet Scrubber Refills, 10 Refills per Box, ( Pack of 6 )",0/0,5.0,We have been using these to scrub the toilets in our house for several years now. The refills are sometimes difficult to find at our local stores and when we do find them they are expensive. This was a great deal on a large quantity. This should last us a long time.
9045,3M Office PRE-MOISTENED WIPES 80 CT ( CL610 ),1/1,5.0,"I bought the wipes for about $9 and I would say it worth the money. This wipes away the sticky dirt; but, it won't completely got away. If I turn off my monitor and look at it closely; I can still notice the mark. However, for my general use, I never realized that the small dirt mark was still there. Overall it works pretty great for my 25&#34; LCD monitor. I spent $100 on my monitor; so, I don't want to spend too much for the monitor. If you got an expensive monitor and your eyes are very sensitive, then you might want to try another brand that has better review."

9048,Whoozit Starz Lights and Sounds Activity Toy,0/0,3.0,I bought this for my 3 mth old but she doesn't like it. It doesn't have any sound to it unless you pull the cord and the extensions don't really do anything so it's pretty boring compared to other toys I've bought. The velcro black loop is not as sturdy either.
9049,Vinyl Mattress Protector 3 Gauge - Full Size (Zippered),0/0,1.0,"Ripped in several places while I was putting it on. Surface became dry and brittle over time, eventually puncturing in several places on top as well. All in all a terrible purchase, not one I'll be making again."

Its the only yogurt she takes and since we moved to westchester. it's been hard to get. Wholefoods is a distance away and only sometimes carry it. And I don't know who the distributor is but they got to work harder. And take care of the expiration dates... it's from France... it's dated reversed... Please come back to Amazon! Make this mommy happy!
9058,"Vetri-Science Laboratories Canine Plus Senior Chewable Tablets, 180 Count",0/0,3.0,"I purchased these vitamins from entirely pets but I had used them previously from a local feed store. The vitamins are excellent but when I received this bottle the box, bottle and contents smelled highly of pesticides (just like roach spray). My dog wouldn't touch the vitamins in this bottle and she normally eats them with no problem. I won't purchase anything from entirely pets again. Find this Vitamin from another seller."

S/H was figured separately for the pick and refill, even though they were from the same source and came together. Would have liked to buy a package of several plus refills in same package.

Somehow I ended up looking at the ingredients list. It is completely impossible to differentiate this from just about any junk food product on the market.Sugar, check.A whole bunch of things on the ingredients list which are actually sugar but have a different name to hide how much sugar is in it(e.g. apple juice concentrate), check.Processed grains with names which sound like they are whole grains(e.g. wheat starch, rice flour), check.Chemicals with unpronounceable names(e.g. zinc sulfate, mixed tocopherols, dicalcium sulfate), check.A couple vitamins added to hide the fact that this is mostly sugar and refined grains and pretend that it is healthy (e.g. pyridioxine hydrochloride, thiamin hydrochloride), check.If you don't have time to cut up fruit or vegetables, just buy cheerios. They are no more healthy but at least they are cheaper."

9067,Gazillion Bubble Machine,0/0,5.0,"My daughter loves this bubble machine. It really does make a ton of bubbles. You don't have to use the specific bubble liquid. I refilled it with bubbles that I got at Walgreens and it does the same. Tons of bubbles and much cheaper too. I do listen to the warnings from the other reviewers and so I don't leave it out in the rain and make sure to keep the battery compartment dry after each use. So far, it is still going strong.

9079,Boundaries,2/4,1.0,"I realized this is a book for Christians and it's theories are based on the bible when I picked up two copies for me and my mother to read. We both struggle with healthy boundaries in the workplace and at home. She is a devout catholic and I am an agnostic. I thought it was very interesting how we both ended up hating this book. Using the myth of creation, the story of Adam and Eve, to justify why we take on too much as individuals is asinine. We live in a society that pushes us to be perfect. Even my mother felt that the book was base, silly, and misleading, using biblical quotes loosely and taking many things out of context. The bible is the ONLY book referenced throughout the entire text. In a literate society, you'd think the authors would realize Christians read more than just the bible. With all of the popular literature on social science, health and psychology, they could use something other than an ancient text of myths, legends, and poetry to guide individuals who are struggling with REAL PROBLEMS and REAL RELATIONSHIPS in the REAL WORLD. Instead they rely on the power of old words like ""sin"", ""evil"", ""Satan"", and dangerous notion that boundary issues are a ""Christian"" problem, and thus should be solved strictly in a ""Christian"" form and fashion."
9080,Enzymatic Therapy DGL Ultra Chocolate,0/0,4.0,I have used this product before to manage too much acid in my stomach. I like the German Chocolate flavor. It is great to have when you need something quick.
9081,"Rawhide Brand Natural Chips, 16-Ounce, Bag/Decal",1/1,5.0,"I have a ten pound silky terrier, and these keep her entertained for hours. These are very thick and last for days rather than a few minutes like the ones I had been getting at PetSmart. They are very long, I would prefer they were cut in half since my dog is small, but she seems to manage them ok. I would definitely buy again."

9089,CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit,0/0,1.0,"Be prepared for a mess on your floor! And if you have tile floors around your toilet, be extra cautious! I followed the direction to a T. I had 2 cats that I was trying to train. They seemed to do ok when there was no hole in the tray. As soon as a hole appeared, one of them freaked out and started going to the bathroom (pee and poo) on the floor. I gave them a lot of time without a hole too. Be aware that when you first start, the cat will probably want to put all four paws on the tray with the litter. And since they've squeezed all four paws into such a tiny space, where does their back end wind up? You guessed it - perched over the seat! So... I hate to paint a picture here, but since their rear-end is over the seat, the pee goes onto the seat, drips all over the toilet and onto the floor! I eventually had to give up on this thing after a number of weeks. I couldn't even make it to the first hole with one of my cats. My cats were miserable and then I had to regrout the bathroom floor because NOTHING (no chemicals, bleach, Nature's Miracle, etc) could take the stain or stink out of the grout."
9090,"Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Lemon Zinger, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,This is my favorite tea to drink when I have the winter blues. The tea is a pick me up and I love the taste.

So I try not to give this to my bun... I might get infant's yogurt chips instead in the future."

I admit, I checked the websites of my local department stores and was amazed at how much more they wanted, so I came back and ordered it. Now when I wear it, I'm reminded of things I did in my &#34;younger&#34; years!"
9099,"Stila Eye Shadow Pans, 0.09 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I really love this color. I've owned a lot of Stila's shadow pans, but this is a color that I've been looking for for a while. It applies as a matte plummy with gray/brown tones.It is not as intense as the pan looks, but can be easily built up to be darker. Wet, it makes a nice neutral eyeliner."
9100,Suretrack Clips,0/0,5.0,"Should have gotten these when my son was younger. This is an invaluable addition to any train set. You will not need to rebuild every two seconds or nail/glue pieces down. Really helpful on awkward uphill and down hill sections as well. The clips can also connect to the funny shapes of split tracks, which was a pleasant surprise."
9101,Settlers Of Catan 4th Edition Bundle,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my sons. I decided to play it with them the other day.. it looked really complicated. It didn't take me long to catch on. It is fun and requires some thinking. It is as good as all the hype about it.
9102,Melissa & Doug Fairy Fantasy Jigsaw 48 Piece,0/0,3.0,My three year old will spent hours playing puzzles. Nice addition to her stack. I will say older Melissa and Doug puzzles seem to be made of better quality.

I also take one azo homeopathic medicine pill, and this helps to avoid yeast infections and to balance the levels of ph. These two products together work wonderful for me, I'm really happy and I want to spread the news. Try d-mannose! (If you already got a UTi, take one full TB every 3 hours for 3-5 days. If you feel like you are almost cured but not completely, I recommend trying any of these over the counter treatments for yeast infections.-[...]- Karla"

9107,Goddard's Granite And Marble Furniture Polish,0/0,5.0,"We have a hammered copper dining table in a salt-sea air location. This polish gives a lovely bright shine and protects it from the elements. We use it weekly and it does not build-up. Other copper products are 'cleaners' and have the potential to destroy the patina we love. So, although this product does not list any metals on it's package, I can recommend it from personal use!"

9112,Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System,0/0,4.0,"I would 100% give this 4 stars if I could just buy the cleanser, but I don't need the 2 other products - they don't work well with my skin. I agree about the comments that one of the other steps burns my sensative skin. I would buy this cleanser more often if it came by itself, but I really try to ration it b/c it's so expensive to buy the 3 in one. My sister-in-law told me about this system, so I had to try it. I use the cleanser pretty much every day twice a day and noticed way less break-outs or big red bumps that hurt and turned into zits. I figured out that I can use this cleanser with a Neurogena sensative skin lotion with spf 15 and I can keep my face clean and fresh. I've been using it since the spring of 2012. I do still mix in some other neutrogena face scrubs in the summer when my face is really oily and I want to exfoliate more than this product does.Neutrogena - please, please, please offer the cleanser on it's own for those of us with really sensative skin!!!"
9113,Lolita Lempicka,0/0,5.0,I have been wearing this perfume ever since it was given to me as a gift over 10 years ago. I love the soft delicate tones and for me it lasts all day. I have worn it both during the daytime and in the evening and always get great comments on it.

It was a completely successful purchase. Thank you."
9123,Carpet Scratching Post with Feather Toy,0/0,5.0,"I have two cats. One lets me clip her nails. The other was feral until 6 months, and I got the post for her to stay inside when I trapped and spayed her and she became a bit friendlier while recovering from spay surgery.In the state the scratching post arrives in, I don't think it is a very safe product. More than once, the kitten got her toes stuck in the elastic that holds the feathers to the post. She would scream and I would have to assist in freeing her paw. She also got the elastic wrapped around her, and it's probably possible for a kitten to get the neck caught if the feathers got tangled to the base of the elastic in just the right way and made a loop. On the other hand, the feather and elastic toys will quickly be pulled off of the post by an energetic and engaged cat. So, the post doesn't stay dangerous long, and the kitten seemed to have a lot of fun. I think having her paw caught made her angry so that she wanted to attack the feathers even more. It was also good fun for me to watch her play and not destroy my things. After the feathers got pulled off by the cat, I replaced them with some mardi gras beads that I attached to the bit of elastic still sticking out the top of the post. The beads were much safer. The kitten never got stuck on them, and had fun attacking. She also managed to pull the post over so it fell on her, but it's light and she was much bigger then.Well, the feather toys fell off the post within a month of getting it. It's been 6 months since then, and the scratching post is now just a scratching post with no toy. The kitten (now cat) who this was initially purchased for uses it exclusively to scratch her nails, and does not touch furniture or the apartment carpet. She likes the texture of the post, and she may have gotten used to using it when she was small. (I also rubbed catnip into it periodically during the first months I had it.) The post still looks OK, although it is getting scruffy and bare near the top. I think it will last a year with heavy use from one cat, and minimal use from the other.The cat who lets me clip her nails barely uses the scratching post, and I have to keep her nails trimmed weekly so she isn't at the furniture.In general, I think the post is a little small. For the cat who is bad about using it, I think she likes to reach high above her head and stretch out to scratch, and that is why she wants to scratch on furniture - to scratch on something taller. For the kitten (now cat) who exclusively uses the scratching post, she tends to scratch the square base as much as the post. I notice the entire post slide around on the floor (also carpeting, so plenty of friction and not slick) when she does this. That might bother a cat, and a larger heavier post wouldn't do it.It also sheds small pieces of carpet onto the floor when the cats use it. So, plan on buying one that is the same color as the carpeting around it. I bought at a pet store, and the North American Pet brand had some lighter and darker carpet colors to choose from for this post.Overall, this scratching post was a good buy for the money. The kitten who needed a post got into the habit of using it, and hasn't bothered the furniture since she was very new to the house. If you are worried about safety issues for your cat, then you should immediately detach the feathers by cutting the elastic close to where the elastic attaches to the metal chains. Then replace with a small cut section of mardi gras beads. That makes for a safer cat toy which won't catch the paws or wrap around and catch itself to lasso the cat."

I decided to use these in my computer mouse (I play games such as World of Warcraft, and other heavy mouse using programs for music and such). My mouse takes one AA battery, and I was going through about 1-2 batteries per month. Since purchasing these batteries months ago, I am yet to open up the pack after using one in my mouse. Not to mention, the battery level is still reading full. As far as I am concerned, these pass the test. I would like to see how they work in other applications but if you are a heavy PC gamer with a wireless mouse, I'd go ahead and recommend these."

9131,Natural Calm Natural Vitality,2/2,5.0,"After no less than 25 years of having chronic constipation and bloating and many, many doctors visits with no long term relief...a friend of mine at work suggested me trying this. It tastes like Crystal Light Lemon Aid with a hint of Raspberry, by no means unpleasant (make sure you drink it BEFORE you brush your teeth in the morning...). Within 24 hours, after a multi day stretch of worse than normal stomach problems...there was relief!!! Hoping it wasn't a fluke, I continued my daily drink of 1 to 2 teaspoons in the morning. It's not a fluke, I feel great! I'm happier, I'm not bloated all the time and I swear that I've lost 3 pant sizes in one week because it works so well! The best part, unlike using laxatives, there's no bloating or other unpleasantness that comes along with laxative use. It's like I've had a normal stomach all along. You, hopeful reader, have nothing to lose with this product. It has done in 24 hours what countless doctors and over the counter remedies HAVEN'T done in 25 years!! I would give it a million stars as a rating if I could!!"

I was on HRT and thought maybe I could taper off to a product like this, but the hot flashes came roaring back.

I am writing this review with my daughter sleeping safely next to me. I feel so much better knowing that I can keep her with me around the house and still get things done because I can wheel her around the house. I used a Moby wrap with my son, but he's 4 now, and I need to be mobile with two children. So, now if he needs me to play with him or get him something, I can keep my daughter in the room with us, and keep an eye on her, and not worry. Since she does't cry when she needs something, I don't trust the baby monitors, I would rather have her where I can see her. This is the perfect product for just that, small, portable, and lightweight."

Needless to say, I was hesitant about trying this product. But, I gave it a whirl. And you know what happened? Nothing. Well, nothing negative that is. No breakouts, no dry skin. Yet, I still noticed the positive effects creatine is supposed to have on the body. This is a great product at a great price"
9140,"Premium Choice Extra Strength with Baking Soda Scoopable Cat Litter, 25 Pound Bag",1/1,5.0,"I thought I already left a review on this, but maybe not. I'm senile like that. Anyhow, I have two senior cats--one male (a.k.a the Stinkinator) and the other female (a.k.a Smells Like Roses). I really like this litter as far as litter goes (can you be excited about litter?). I've tried most brand-name products and most often used Fresh Step, which was alright but way too dusty and expensive, and I also didn't care for the perfume; I just really hated their ""extreme"" version, which was nothing more than extremely useless and too clay-ish. Most other brands just didn't cut it.Although I tried this product several times and liked it, along with the regular unscented (blue bag/container), I recently wanted to give one other brand a shot that was similar, which was Precious Cat. I also did this because Amazon doesn't seem too keen to carry Premium Choice as they do the Precious Cat, as I've been noticing it less and less. So far, I can't wait to be done with the Precious Cat so I can move back to this brand ha. I felt that Premium Choice had better clumping and was less ""muddy"" when my senior male used the box, and I felt that it had much better odor control. Now, don't get me wrong. In order to block out Salem's foul stench, post-defecation or urination, you would need nothing short of radiation cleansing and an Israeli-style gas mask, as well as plenty of time until both cat and nuclear-type fallout cleared, but this product worked fairly well considering. In fact, I noticed far less gusto in his bragging verbal announcements after he went while using this product versus other times. Coincidence? Perhaps, but I'm more pleased that I didn't have to suffer half as much as before, especially considering the bathroom the box is in is open to my bedroom. And is that not disturbingly human male-like, for male cats to announce their deeds? I'll never understand this concept.I have not tried their scented version, but out of the baking soda version (green) and the one without (blue), I definitely prefer the baking soda version--though the blue might work okay for females. However, since it's not perfectly capable of eliminating odors 100% as I would much rather prefer, I also find that it works well to use products like Odorzout powder and/or ZeroOdor spray. Surprisingly, these two products did not help me with the Precious Cat litter, which I thought was strange, and I had scrubbed the 2-month-old box entirely before using it in order to test properly.Again, my cats are passed their retirement years (not that they have ever done much with their existence otherwise, other than stare at me in that inferior-like way, sleep, and eat), so I'm sure this makes a difference, but they go a lot and I clean the box once or twice a day. There is a slight (very slight) odor after several days of use (with cleaning/adding more), but it's more a litter smell than a urine one. The Odorzouts or Zero Odor help this, making it so I don't have to change the litter completely more than every two weeks, but I felt it worth mentioning anyway. The Precious Cat and other brands, however, flat-out smelled like urine within the first day, even after scrubbing their box clean and changing it often, so that was a big points deduction in comparison. Again, it could be my freak of a cat, and I'm sure everyone will experience different things based on their cat's needs. I just feel there's an upside to this product when it comes to odor, personally. The real test was my partner, who really does not like cats and loves to complain about the smell (and sometimes lack thereof). Even he mentioned how he couldn't smell anything, but not so with the other brand I've tried recently.The litter lasts quite a long time and works well in my Omegapaw box, and there is hardly any issue with dust. In fact, it was the least dusty one I've tried yet, which is great. It also seems to do pretty well with not sticking to the bottom of the box so much, which my male seems to enjoy aiming for--more for spite, I think. Since it's not muddy like other products, this helps even more so when it comes to that and it helps me to avoid having to bang on the bottom of the litter box like a congo drum in the early mornings or late at night. I also feel that, out of all the litters I've tried, this one tracks far less. Mind you, it is not 100% perfect in this, but I notice a dramatic difference out of the one I'm currently on, which has me vacuuming several times a day vs. once a day or every two days with the Premium Choice. I have also cut up an old yoga mat to use as a litter trap mat, since I'm way to cheap to buy a specific litter mat, and it seems to work great for that.All in all, I repent and have learned from my folly of using another product and plan to go back to this one soon. It is not perfect, but it so far seems to do the best and I can't afford to buy ones like EverClean. I don't care much for the bags and find them awkward, but that's from my laziness and something that can easily be resolved. I did save the containers from the 16-pound ones though, which does help (in case anyone was debating about that). The price is good though and I personally feel that it works pretty well. I can only hope Amazon will continue to carry the product, because it's not so easy to find. Go figure."

When I know that I am getting edgy, I warn my family, take some Rescue Remedy, and within a few hours I am feeling back to normal. Some people have reviewed it and said it did not work for them, but it works for me. Don't believe the comments about it being the cereal alcohol either. There is not enough cereal alcohol in 5-8 drops to be of ANY significance in evaluating this product. Hope you have the same benefit that I did. I love it because it is natural. I lived in Brazil for four years and Bach Flowers are used a great deal by many people. They even have whole pharmacies dedicated to these remedies. Brazilians are very health conscious and want to stay away from chemicals as much as possible."

I like that it is not too overly fragranced. It is just an easy lotion to apply, doesn't sting on really dry skin, and does a great job.It is not for super cracked or deep dry patches, although with a lot of application, I'm sure it would do a good job. This particular size is great for keeping in the car or on your nightstand. My feet and elbows are always screaming for a little moisture, especially in the winter.I have tried other lotions and always come back to Curel."

I have to agree with her - they are not nearly as soft and comfortable feeling as the Underjams. I had tried these hoping they would be slimmer profile and less obvious, which I think maybe they are, but uncomfortable is a show-stopper for my kid. Underjams are soft and absorbent."
9155,Emani Flex Mineral Pressed Foundation,0/0,5.0,This was shipped/delivered super fast! IT is a great product for the price. I found that it covers nicely along with my benefit liquid foundation (I have acne scars that need to be covered up.)

I used the product exactly as per the instructions but it didnt clean my puppy one bit! He is pure white, so it is pretty easy to see if a product has helped clean him up or not.The only reason I have given it two stars is that it is like using a good conditioner. It makes my puppy's fur very smooth and soft and makes him smell really good!"

Very nice when you have a 2.5 year old jumping up and down ready to play. One thing to note, is that the stabilizing leg attachments may be difficult to slide into place for a younger child. Until my son is older we just put them aside, but it does not affect the usability of the crane.We are very pleased with the quality of this truck."

9174,Suave Professionals Sleek Shampoo (14.5 Ounces),0/0,5.0,"I am currently 14 years old, and I was searching and searching for the right shampoo for my hair. I have tried every shampoo brand out there from Garnier, Matrix, Pantene and Tressemme. I had even spent all of my $60.00 of birthday money on stupid Wen...ha! what a waste that was! All these shampoos that I have tried made my hair oliy, greasy, grimy,flat, and dull. I also suffer from severe asthma, combined with chronic bronchitis and sinus disease, and every time I used these shampoos, I would burst into full-blown wheezing and my nose would run like crazy! Then, one day, I discovered Suave products. I was in the store with my mom, looking like the idiot trying to choose between a shampoo as usual. My hand was reaching for the Tressemme smooth and silky..and then...my eyes spotted this. I bought this along with the Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo, and the Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying Shampoo as well. My hair has never been so healthy while using Suave products. My friends (who use Wen)ask me ""what shampoo do you use in your hair? It looks so shiny and healthy!"", I just simply reply,""Suave"", and they just look at me, dumbfounded. Even strangers ask me the same question, and I simply reply ""Suave"" My hairstylist is even suprised of how healthy my hair has become! She asks me as well, ""what do you use to get your hair so sleek?"", here's how it went today when I went:""What do you use to get your hair so sleek?""""Suave""""No...""""Yes!, yes I do""""What else do you use in your hair besides Suave?""""Thats it""""No shine serums..""""Nope""""No straighteners..?""""Nah""""No conditioner?""""No way!""Yeah, thats right..I don't even have to use conditioner in my hair anymore. Before I had to use a ton. Until I used Suave.If you ask me, Suave shampoos are the best thing that have hit the market today. This one (Suave Sleek) is not NEARLY as oliy as Garnier's Sleek and Shine shampoo. This actually clarifies your hair. The smell of this shampoo is great, and, yeah, you might not need conditioner after using this because it makes your hair so sleek without it. If you have thick, straight hair like me, it will make your hair even sleeker and shinier! Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint Shampoo also works AMAZING as well! Try that out too. Suave really knows how to make an excellent shampoo at a reasonable price range, thats all I have to say! :)Other Suave shampoos I would recommend:*Suave Professionals Rosemary Mint shampoo*Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying shampoo*Suave Naturals Refreshing Tangerine shampoo*Suave Naturals Mango Mandarin shampooHope this helps! :)"

9176,"Breast Success - Breast Enhancement Pills, 180 ct (2 Month Supply",0/0,1.0,I had tried and bought a 3 month supply and it DOES NOT WORK. I used it for 2 months and figured what the heck i have another month ill use it. It showed no progress I'm still as little as I was before. One thing is i think it made me grow hair on neck which is gross!! so I'm hoping that the hair will stop growing now that I've stopped taking it.

9179,PetAg Emergency Feeding Kits for Pets,0/0,1.0,They sent me the puppy kit when I ordered the Kitten kit - I went back and checked my order and I did order Kitten. Than the sample formula was expired by about 6 months. Only thing I can use in kit is the bottle so this ended up being expensive for just one bottle. Not worth the cost to return. Next time I will buy from petstore and make sure I get correct formula and non expired formula.
9180,BABYBJORN Potty Chair,0/0,5.0,"Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't ""use"" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the ""talking"" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips."

9182,OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush,0/0,5.0,I have a Takeya glass water bottle (also purchased on Amazon) and it is pretty long and hard to clean with the brush I use to clean my daughter's bottles with (Dr Browns). I purchased this one and it fits the Takeya perfectly. OXO makes great products and this one is made well too.

9186,"Skin Success Eventone Fade Cream, Regular - 2.7 oz",0/0,5.0,"It says that you should see results in 2 weeks. Well, I didn't, but I guess we all have different skin. I could start seeing results within the first month (right cheek & forehead). It truly works.Make sure you use it with a sunscreen though. Fade creams can potentially damage skin when the profuct is on and the skin is exposed to sunlight.Along with the fade cream, I used Alba's Skin Lotion w/h SPF 15 as well as Palmer's Cocoa Butter Lotion during the night. On nights were it got really cold, I used Bio Oil on my face with the fade cream underneath.Will definitely buy a second bottle (well, jar) soon."
9187,LEGO Bionicle 8531 Pohatu,0/0,5.0,"Bought these for resale on eBay. They were great items for selling overseas since, at the time,Lego USA doesn't ship overseas."

9191,"Similac Advance Newborn, Ready to Feed, 2-Fluid Ounces (Pack of 48) (Packaging May Vary)",0/0,5.0,"I mainly bf, but do supplement occassionally and these are perfect. It doesn't make sense to open a large bottle of formula if you're only giving 2-4 oz/day because there's no way you'd be able to use it all before they say to throw it away. I use the enfamil nipples that Amazon sells or I pour into a bottle."
9192,Ginger Drink -Gold Kili 120 Sachets Packed in 6 Bags,0/0,5.0,I have been making the Ginger Drink everyday for a few months. I find it very refreshing and stopped drinking coffee. I love mixing the Ginger Drink with Chai green tea.

9195,Assorted 6 Pack of Iron Chef Sauces,0/0,5.0,"I bought all six of these sauces because they are all good. Sometime you will buy a quantity of things to save, but not so with these sauces. I did save, but I'm really happy with each of these for different reasons. I do a lot of stir chichen, fish and rice and these go good with everything. I highly recommend. I don't use them to marinade BTW. I put in maybe a heaping tablespoon while the things are cooking. Saves on product and gives a nicer glaze, I think. I found them hard to find in stores, but worked out great with free shipping from Amazon."
9196,Ty Beanie Baby Dora the Explorer (Styles and Colors may vary),0/0,4.0,I was a little worried this doll would be too little and not cute. But as soon as I opened the package i was relieved. She was in great condition and perfect size for my little girl.

9201,Annatto Seed,0/0,5.0,Annatto seeds can be difficult to find in the store. I liked getting the seeds because the grind so well in a spice grinder (not a blender). They are nice and fresh and add a nice flavor to my recipes. I will purchase from this company again.
9202,Stork Craft Aspen 5 Drawer Chest,0/0,1.0,"The side panel on the item came cracked but we didn't notice until after we put it together. Since its impossible to take apart or fit back in the original box, I asked amazon to send us a new box in order to return the defective product. They are unable to so I am stuck as a new mom with a cracked dresser with drawers that only open half way. This thing is to safe for a nursery. Do not buy."

I found my second bottle online and am ready to purchase my third. I LOVE this scent. It reminded me a bit of Allure. Very soft, feminine scent. I love the description from the other review, although I am not sure I would consider it woodsy. Don't let that scare you away if you are looking for something soft, because this is definitely it. You will not be disappointed!"
9208,Badger Basket Company Natural Baby Moses Basket,0/0,4.0,Love the basket wand it was perfect for what we used it for. I just thought it would be a bit more sturdy. Not that I think it's going to fall apart or anything. It was dedinitely a good buy
9209,"Safari Cat Shedding Comb, Wood Handle",0/0,5.0,For getting mats out of your cat's coat you can't beat this tool. I have used it in my cat grooming business for over twenty years and I wouldn't recommend anything else but this comb. All the fancier tools out there just don't do the job this simply comb does for getting out all the dead hair and tugging off the mats. My customers have used this as well and won't go to anything else.
9210,Melissa & Doug Classic ABC Block Cart,0/0,5.0,I love all of the Melissa & Doug toys. You can not beat the quality for the price. These toys will stand the test of time.
9211,"Glucerna Shake Homemade Vanilla, 8 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)",0/0,4.0,Tastes great. Could be bigger for the price though. I use it to make shakes in the morning before work.
9212,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,4.0,"We never thought we'd need a noise machine, but we found it helped our baby stay asleep when there was a lot of ruckus going on, either in the house or outside. It's not pretty, but it's solid and does the job without crapping out. We can have soirees downstairs, and with this on, our daughter can't even hear what's going on.She's a good sleeper, and she's not dependent on the white noise to be able to sleep (she's now 13+ months and sleeps regularly at grandma & grandpa's and they don't have one), but it's really, really helpful most nights."
9213,"the supernatural | poreless, flawless spf 15 tinted primer | philosophy",0/0,5.0,"I love using this primer for winter. Winter season gives me such dry skin and the moisturizers I use make my skin too greasy. This primer moisturizes my skin enough to make applying make-up easier. Also, the makeup looks natural and more even-toned on my skin. Would recommend."
9214,Bump Patrol Original Formula After Shave Intensive Treatment 4oz,0/0,5.0,"I have been using various different methods to prevent bumps. Everything from Aftershave, electric razors, wet shave, magic shave no shave. By far, this is the best product I have found. I just find it weird that I only found it in a store in Michigan so far and no where else. Good thing there's Amazon!"
9215,Lee's Two-Way Guppy Breeder,0/0,1.0,"The birthing female guppy became very stressed when put in here. She was cramped and felt trapped and vulnerable. She did not birth one fry in this container, even after being left in here overnight but when I removed her, she dropped fry. So I had to manually catch the fry and put them in. Plus she scraped off a few scales, I think from the little plastic handle inside which is much too sharp. The V insert is HARD to remove. The handle is small and very difficult to get ahold off. The V shape insert gets wedged in and I could not remove it. Instead of being able to lift the V with the mom out, I had to dump the female out then use a knife to get the insert out, defeating the whole purpose. It not work well for birthing which is why I bought it. Stressed out the female fish and frustrated me. Not pleasant for either of us."
9216,Rectangular Pillow Dog Bed,0/0,5.0,"I would not recommend this to anyone with a puppy. My dog is 6 mos old. Even though I showed him how to use it, he continues to bite it. He thinks it is a big toy! The pillow is beautiful and I can't wait till my dog will be nice to it and use it like it is supposed to be. It took much longer to get here than was expected and the shipping was very pricey. I'm glad I purchased it, but I would have rather have paid considerably less by going to a store."
9217,"3M Littmann Master Classic II Stethoscope, Hunter Green Tube, 27 inch, 2632",0/0,5.0,Have not used yet. Littmann has such a great reputation. So I'm sure it will work well. Can't wait to use it.
9218,Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,1/1,4.0,I could never get my 3 year old to pick up all of the stuffed animals in her room until we purchased this product. The hammock is a &#34;bed&#34; for her stuffed animals and she picks all of the animals up and puts them to bed. GREAT product.Good quality and includes mounting materials. Super easy to install.

9220,Nature's Way Metabolic ReSet,0/0,3.0,"I bought this product about a week and half ago. Was looking forward to trying this to get rid of some weight. I replaced two meals a day with this. I mixed this with unsweented almond milk and ice. It blended up nicely in my Ninja blender. The taste was okay, not great but not nasty. I was full for about 3-4 hours and that was great. Now the bad part...I had the worst gas with this shake. If you have ever tried a sugar free candy and had too much, well it acts like a laxative. I was in the bathroom a lot and the gas was so gross. I thought well maybe my body will get use to it. I couldn't do it anymore after a week. Maybe if I didn't have a job or life I could just lock myself in the bathroom all day, but not when you have a job and share a bathroom. I'm giving this 3 stars because it did keep me full and it didn't taste that bad."
9221,Nature's Way Fo-Ti Root,0/0,5.0,"I came across this while looking up the &#34;superherbs&#34; and read all the benefits which one was it turns your hair back to it's normal color. And it did. I no longer have to use the Hair for Men products every 3 months. Research it, and give it a try."

9223,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"Among the Pampers Swaddlers, Costco Kirkland, and Huggies Snug and dry, this is so far the best and I am 100% satisfied and don't even want to try other brands. It is the softest one, even better than Pampers Swaddlers. It smells good but I think a little bit too strong. Use it for my baby day and night. Don't even to buy the night diapers. It is pretty dry even after the whole night."
9224,"25 FDA Approved One Step HCG Urine Pregnancy Test, Cassette Style",0/0,4.0,"I really like everything about this test. I like how it is very accurate, how it is in a small convent package, the price is great, and that it comes with a dropper. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it would have been perfect if these came with a collection cup."
9225,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,5.0,"I have been a Pampers mom since the birth of my firstborn. I like the baby dry better than the cruisers because these fit her better. They seem to be slimmer and longer (sits higher on the waist). We are nearly done with diapers for the older one now, but I will buy them again for the baby when she grows in to 5's"
9226,Simplee Cleen Household Swivel Mop Microfiber Damp Scrub Pad,0/0,5.0,"I have 3 of these pads I use on my Swifter mop. They work a lot better than the paper type which cost a small fortune. When theses pads get dirty, simply throw them in the wash with your cloths or towels. The pad is a good quality product that will last a long long time."
9227,Logona Natural Body Care Herbal Hair Color Powders,0/0,5.0,"Even though the produt is called flame red, it is really quite a natrual color. It is not a tradinally henna as it has a host of other plants in the mix. It colors your hair and when it fades, does so naturally. Also very easy to apply as the dye stuff washes out easily and leaves behind a great color."
9228,Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Changing Pad Cover,0/0,5.0,"The color and material are great! I haven't washed it yet though, so I'm not sure how it turns out after washing."
9229,Universal 95001 1-Size 500 Vinyl Coated Wire Paper Clips,0/0,5.0,I absolutely love paper clips and use them on and with everything. I like the coating because they don't leave that mark on pages like metal ones do. I also have used them to seal up potato chip bags to keep the chips fresh. I have also used them to fold up my pant legs and hold them in place during the day and also while sewing them. Great great great product and great price.

9233,AquaClear Power Filter (UL Listed),0/0,5.0,Received packaged swiftly. Installed without a hitch and it is super quiet. Hopefully the impeller stays quiet. The only downside was that there was too little biomax for the AC70. I will look into getting more to fill up the surface area.
9234,"Coralife 54332 Actinic Straight Pin Compact Fluorescent Lamp, 24-Watt",0/0,5.0,"I have an 8 and a 14G Biocube both salt and I love both of them. The lights 10,000k and Actinic 420 actually last awhile I had the same bulbs for a year I got new one's your really supposed to change them about every 6-7 months for proper coral growth. NO BS whithin the first 3 hours everything opened up and has grown tremendously in the past 3 weeks now. You might complain about the price but for what they do and how long they last their 100% worth it."
9235,Punky Color,0/0,5.0,"Smells good (raspberry?), stays the right color red for a long time and then fades to a lighter shade but never totally washes out. Exactly what I wanted."
9236,Graco Bumper Jumper,0/0,5.0,For its cheap price It sure is a great buy! Has attachments for toys and a tray. My 5 month old jumps her little heart out in it. It adjusts so it can grow with her.. Worth every penny!
9237,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,5.0,"This norelco all in 1 is amazing...plenty of attachments that work, and the beard comb/trimmer works perfect for me; it has 9 settings that are easy to use and see what setting youre on, it's quiet, does the job quickly. In 2 minutes my beard is perfectly groomed. attachments attach/detach quickly and easily. it comes with a storage bag. And I swear this thing never needs recharged. It's been in use for a month now and still doesnt need recharged!"
9238,"Good Earth Original Tea, 18 Tea Bags (6 Pack)",1/1,2.0,"One of the little joys in my day used to be opening up a pack of good earth tea, reading the little daily quote (which was almost always different with every tea bag!), and enjoying the really good, all-natural brew. Now the brew is no longer all-natural (my box has 'artificial flavor' listed second), and after my first batch of purple boxes significantly reduced the number of quippy daily quotes (there were about 5 in rotation), now it's just a sad little white paper hanging off the end of the string. I'm officially out of love with this tea. Which is too bad, as I used to be a fairly good word-of-mouth salesperson for this tea. You've lost my business, Tata."
9239,Want Want Big Shelly Shenbei Snowy Crispy Rice Cracker Biscuits - Sugar Glazed 5.30 oz.,0/0,5.0,"I still enjoy my treats from Japan. These are light, sweet, low calorie., as well as individually packaged. What more could you want?"

9242,The Wet Brush,1/1,4.0,"Does wonders for detangling my 7 year old daughter's hair, even when dry. She used to avoid brushing her hair but this brush does the trick - she even snuck it into her room and brushed on her own. Very nice!One star ding for the annoying smell. It's only been a few days so hopefully the smell goes away, but out of the package it was like new car tires... Today was better."

It comes with some games loaded, plus you can buy used game cartridges to save money."

They cut your hair effortlessly and have not hung up or pulled yet, don't think they ever will. Only thing I don't like is the cheep case they come in, very thin and flimsy and every thing just gets thrown in there, no organization. not a big deal but would be nice to have some order about it.

9259,"Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic Styler with 3 Attachments",0/0,5.0,"If you smooth out your hair, you must have this dryer-period. It even eliminates the need for a flat iron! I've been using this dryer for 15yrs! It went from black to silver ionic & now there's a black ceramic one out. It also doubled in price this yr & is now at $49.99 in stores. I have long, frizzy, wavy, colicky awful hair that has to be smoothed out 1x/wk. This dryer allows me to blowout my own hair beautifully with awesome shiny flips in 15 min just by taking wet sections & brushing them till dry. Without this dryer, I'm completely screwed...I keep 3 brand new back-ups on hand at all times. It's not abnormally loud or heavy, and SO much easier than using a round brush & regular dryer. Do yourself a favor, try this dryer. You'll be amazed!"
9260,Melissa & Doug Giraffe Plush,0/0,4.0,"This Giraffe is of amazing quality for the price. You can feel the quality when you grab it and pick it up. It is dense and comfy without weighing a lot. It stands on it's own firmly on the ground. If bumped from the side it can fall over pretty easily but forward and backward resistance is strong. The only bad thing was is that the head on my giraffe seems to be twisted a little too much to one side and the seams are well off from matching. The giraffe showed in the picture is looking a lot more straight forward than mine. I don't know if this was a creative TWIST an employee put on it but it didn't work. Nevertheless, I like the product and the slight difference in appearance from the picture is not enough for me to want to send it back. I would recommend this product to a friend. Just hope they put your head on straight."
9261,Now Foods Echinacea with Goldenseal Extract,0/0,3.0,"This may be an excellent product! But it tastes SO awful, I'm not going to find out. If you can take the pill form, TAKE the pill form! Both Goldenseal and Echinacea are very effective products! And NOW is a very respectable provider. I just wanted to give a heads up to those who were thinking, ""Oh, I'll just add this to my OJ and won't taste it."" You're wrong."
9262,Twinlab 100% Whey Protein Fuel,0/0,5.0,"I would recommend this product. I like to drink this shake after long workouts. Taste ok. It clumps up if your mixing it with a spoon, not sure it will do it using in a shake bottle."
9263,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,5.0,"I wear these when I'm going to be on my feet a lot, or especially when traveling! They keep my feet from swelling and put a spring in my step!"
9264,PB 8,0/0,5.0,"it's cheap and doesn't have a bunch of fillers. I'm gluten and dairy free, so this one is perfect. I like that they seem to have taken out the maltodextrin, which I DO NOT want to ingest."
9265,Better Living The Ulti-Mate Dispenser Deluxe III,0/0,5.0,"This is the third one that I am buying of its kind. It is easy and convenient. It sticks perfectly and never comes out unless u peel it off. When we moved from one house to another after an year, we were able to peel it without any damage to the bath wall and restick it in our new home. The secong time we moved, we were able to peel it, but we coulnt stick it back. It didnt stick properly. I ordered a new one then. Still one time peel and stick is more than fine for me. You have this dispenser with different chambers. I have 2 models. One 3 chamber one and one four chamber one. Both are equally good. No mess in the shower."
9266,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,5.0,"I was struggling to think of a gift for my mom who wants nothing, but always has a hard time sleeping. I picked one of these up for her for Christmas and she said she had the best night of sleep she's had in a long time. Score!"

9269,Dr. Christophers Formulas Herbal Tooth & Gum Powder,1/1,5.0,"I got this paste after researchinng natural choices for my sons cavity, we have been using it for about a month now and his ugly, bigger black cavity has turned to a medium brown. My husband and I can both see it's helping heal his mouth and we are amazed. It's not the best tasting tooth paste but once I explained to my 6 yr old what it was doing he has been willing twice daily... Impressed."
9270,Suave for Kids 2-in-1 Shampoo 12 fl oz (355 ml),0/0,5.0,Arrived on time. No spillage. There was a piece of tape on the top to ensure it would not leak. Great purchase.
9271,Prince of Peace - Ultra Strength Red Panax Ginseng Extractum 2000 mg. - 30 Bottles (10.1 oz.),0/0,5.0,"I wish shipment could be faster on the ginseng. I love this product, but all the GNC's locally have stopped carrying it. Will still continue to buy."
9272,Solgar B-Complex with Vitamin C Stress Formula Tablets,0/0,5.0,Great product for the price. Great way to get my B vitamins every single day. A brand I trust too.
9273,"Tinkle, Crinkle, Rattle & Squeak Worm - Primary",0/0,4.0,Got this for my nephew for Xmas and he's at the point where he's starting to grab and inspect things. Not to mention it's great for him to chew on while he's teething. I wish it lit up or did a little more but no real complaints. Great for infants!
9274,Webkinz Pug,0/0,5.0,"At first, I thought this was going to be a scam. When the package arrived, the dog was in a plastic bag.It is very soft, great for sleeping with. Fairly small, but no less then 10 inches head to bum. It is also very cute,I think any child or grown up would agree. The only reason I rated this 4 stars, is because the ears have little stitches, andmight fall off after a year or two. Besides that, I love the webkinz, and I didn't have a problem with him. Great serviceand I didn't waste my money!"
9275,"Richell Wood Freestanding Pet Gate, Large, Autumn Matte Finish",0/0,5.0,This gate is perfect and does not damage walls or floors. My Maltese does not even attempt to get over it. She usually just sets and waits on me at the gate. I am very petite and it is much easier than most gates for me to step over. I am very pleased with this purchase.
9276,"Snorestop Extinguisher, 0.4 Oz -Plastic Case",0/0,1.0,"I was ecstatic when I first used this product, as I did in fact have a GREAT nights sleep for the first time in years. My enthusiasm died very quickly when I did the research and found the ingredients Belladonna and Ephedra. If you look either one of these ingredients on WebMD, you will find that they are widely considered dangerous and the FDA has put out various warnings on Ephedra.To be fair about this StopSnore claims very little use of these drugs (about .42) It DID work for me and I did not have a terrible reaction, just felt very jittery and anxious.The other side of this is that you will be taking drugs that are banned for professional athletes and the side effects include death.I think the good news is that now that I have been reminded how great it feels to get a good nights sleep, I will immediately turn around and look for non-drug solution, like a mouth-guard or nose piece. If not for me, for my wife."
9277,Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste - 14 oz jar,0/0,2.0,"I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!!"
9278,"BSN CELLMASS, Cellular Infusing Matrix",0/0,3.0,Unfortunately I didn't see too many gains with this and yes I am on a very strict diet and do use a very rigorous workout. I will say the rest of the bsn stack is pretty awesome though.
9279,Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs and Cats,0/0,5.0,"I have a Bichon. She is 10. Her eyes started to get tear stains bad. Someone said to get this product. I thought , Gosh how expensive this is. So I searched online for home remedies, took peoples advice. Nothing worked, NOTHING. 2 years later I seen this, I had the extra money so I bought it. SO expensive in a pet store, well , this stuff is amazing, trust me. buy on Amazon and get a great deal. My Bichon eyes are clearing up and its been 3 weeks. I am so happy I got this, worth every penny, (not in pets stores) Even she feels better. It was a constant bother to her, wiping her eyes on anything she could. Now she is a Happy Bichon. This stuff is just AMAZING... No joking"
9280,Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler,0/0,2.0,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas-she loved it! It did everything advertised...for about six weeks.

9284,"Doc Johnson Lucid Dream #14 Multi-Speed, Waterproof G-Spot Vibrator, Twist-bottom Control",0/0,1.0,"This purchase was because I already had purchased this vibrator several years before. When my old one stopped working, I replaced it immediately with another just like it! Problem is, the replacement just was not made as well as the first one. The second one stopped working almost immediately (three uses.) The replacement was a total waste. Stopped working, altogether, and I would advise you to buy a different product. THIS one just won't work, and is NOT RECOMMENDED."
9285,Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Puzzle Toy for Dogs,0/0,5.0,"My dog can tear up anything...in seconds. The mythology behind this little toy hold true. she loves picking the squirrels, balls, whatever I put in there and goes wild with it, but oddly doesn't destroy it. She destroys everything, but for her this is the most fun game ever.I read it in other people's reviews, but I decided to bite the bullet, knowing I was probably going to bite the bullet on this one.I was wrong, and I couldn't be more thrilled. Now if I can just keep the dog from eating everything else..."
9286,"Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, Black",0/0,5.0,"so it's good to buy this to check yourself, although a gym can do that for you for free, but with this one you can check yourself more frequently. just remember that at different times of the day or days in the month it might show a different reading when you haven't really changed. so it's not 100% accurate but you get an idea eg you are at lets say 28% fat as opposed to closer to 20% (the variations between times of the day are smaller)"
9287,Bull-Dog - Vegetable & Fruit Sauce (Chuno) Sauce 10.1 Fl. Oz.,0/0,5.0,I love this stuff. It is great for stir fries; for chicken and turkey. I think the tonkatsu sauce that they sell is more for beef.I even think I'll like this for scrambled eggs or in a filling for an omelet. Thanks guys!
9288,"RPM 80182 Rear A-Arms Black E-Monster Jam, Rustler, Stampede Black",0/0,5.0,"This will fit just as well as the stock Traxxas parts. They only have three holes for the shock towers to be moved around. DOES NOT come with the mounting gear so if you need the screws with it you will need to order them separately. The difference is strength and flexibility. RPM is the best maker of plastic parts in my opinion. Where others break RPM will flex and absorb the impact. This keeps you from breaking things. I cannot speak highly enough of these parts. I use these even with my aluminum parts as a ""breaking joint"" this is what is supposed to break when I get into too big of jumps and crashes. But my pede just keeps on trucking. Again this is what I will keep on using if I ever need to get new ones."

9291,Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara .3 fl oz (9 ml),0/0,2.0,I use to buy this product all the time when in was available in the U.S because it would look natural and would hold all day. I have very straight eyelashes. This mascara use to be the only one that would hold the shape of my curled eyelashes&#8230;.not any more

9294,Dr. Christophers Formulas Herbal Tooth & Gum Powder,0/0,4.0,"Not my favorite tooth powder, but an economical choice. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and the green color doesn't bother me. It doesn't stain the teeth. If anything, my teeth look much whiter since I've been using this."
9295,Melissa & Doug Jumbo Brown Teddy Bear - Plush,0/0,5.0,This bear is huge and soft. I got it for my wife for Valentines and it is almost as big as she is. Great purchase.Cons
9296,"Medline Bariatric Cane with Offset Handle, Black",0/0,4.0,Great Cane but I can see how it would be a little heavy for some people. I am a big man so it does not pose a problem for me.

9298,CryoCup - Set of Two,0/0,5.0,"As recommended by physical therapists, use of cryocups, also called &#34;ice cupping&#34; enables deeper penetration of the freezing effect because you are constantly moving the block of ice on the affected area. This is a great value to buy two for a good price. Then you always have one ready to use."

I purchased this after doing some research and hoped that an on-the-spot treatment of salicylic acid would help. Unfortunately, it only dries out the pimple and makes it look redder AKA more visible and worst than before!I'm really unhappy with this product, however I think it does help with pimples on the other parts of my face that may arise due to hormones or oily/combination skin and not stress. Those pimples eventually go away a few days after using this product."
9305,Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein,0/0,5.0,"I am very happy with this product and highly recommend to anyone who does not include grains in their diet. This is the only protein supplement I could find that does not contain grains.Love the taste, I use almond milk or water to mix it."
9306,Fried Pork Rinds Mixed 24 bags (1.75oz),0/0,4.0,"I eat Pork Rinds as a snack because they have no carbohydrates. With some other brands I do not like the flavor, especially the plain flavor. However, with these every flavor was great, even the plain flavor. I highly recommend these.Since the time I ordered these the shipping cost has dropped a little but the cost is still about $1.65 per bag (1.75oz). As an alternative check out pork rinds from the Porkie Company, they can be ordered by mail for about $1.00 a bag and the quality is excellent. The nacho flavor is my favorite. I wish they were on Amazon."
9307,Jarrow Formulas Curcumin 95,0/0,5.0,"It's pretty much impossible to know if this product is doing anything worthwhile. We're told turmeric is good for inflammation. Curcumin is that ingredient in turmeric with all the powers. If you believe this to be so, then you will like this product. If you're having some serious issues, I suggest taking a *much* higher dosage than is suggested. Other than that, I use other Jarrow products. Their supplements are some of the best."

9311,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Quarry Mine Tunnel,0/0,5.0,"As with all the Thomas stuff, this tunnel isn't much for the price you pay. However, we really wanted to have some different items to incorporate into his track set. My son is 2 and a little young to fully use the trains, but he continues to be fascinated that the train flies down the ramp and &#34;surprise&#34; pops out the trap door at the bottom. It's also great for building his spatial skills since he has spent a lot of time trying to figure out if the train can go in the other way and poking his fingers through the door to &#34;figure it out&#34;. It's sturdy enough to stand up to a rough toddler who isn't very delicate with it too."

9317,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,5.0,"First, I'll have to admit, China Glaze is now my favorite brand of nail polish out there.. But Four Leaf Clover is by far the best green color I own, now it does have a blueish tint but it's a very good color and it only take a couple coats to be opaque."
9318,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,5.0,This litter box works great! I purchased the small one and the large one. My cats love it and I no longer have to look at an open litter box. This system does exactly what it's advertised to do. It makes cleaning the litter box easy.
9319,"Lixit Glass Water Bottle, 32-Ounce",0/0,4.0,"I am happy with the product. I dropped on accident from a (1ft -1 1/2ft), and the bottle did NOT break. So I was happy that it was durable in that regard! It can be a one person job, however, it will save you tons of time doing it with TWO people, trust me! It has a top bracket with a safety that prevents your pet from lifting the bracket, and dumping the bottle on the ground. The only reason I did NOT give this five stars was due to the fact it drips. It states that it might DO that in the instructions, but for the $22 I expected a little more!"

My 4 year old daughter is allergic to nuts. I grew up eating raw foods and eating healthy and as a result there's hardly anything that I can eat, that I really enjoy.Fortunately, this has none of the aforementioned and I can finally enjoy a tasty treat every now and then. 2 are 120 calories so I naturally don't want to eat the entire box, but 2-3 are fine. For me, it's a terrific, invaluable value and I'm extremely grateful. Let me re-emphasize"

9326,Thomas And Friends Wooden Railway - Up And Away Expansion Pack,0/0,4.0,"I was dreaming of purchasing some other cool looking Thomas-the-Train bridge sets but those colorful sets were sooooooo expensive. This bridge expansion back is much more affordable. Now my 2.5 year old has a fun giant bridge. The red/gray foundation pieces are very sturdy. However, the tan foundation blocks do not hold up to rough play. I recommend also purchasing the Thomas-the-Train Elevated Track Foundation blocks that are black & tan w/ some red brick design. Those are what I use to help hold up my son's large new bridges."

9332,LifeSource UA-100 Home Aneroid Blood Pressure Monitor,0/0,4.0,"I am a retired surgeon with hypertension, having used numerous digital monitors over 2 decades. All of them, without exceptions, deteriorate with time in accuracy when compared with my ancient mercury sphygomanometer. User calibration is seldom available. With this item, you fit the cuff once, the only extra work you have to do is to put on the ear piece, compared with the automatic digital machines. I have used this for over a year without adjustment and it remained accurate as compared with the mercury sphygo, the &#34;gold standard&#34;. You can buy two of these for the price of any automatic machines."
9333,Goat Milk Powder 12 Ounces,0/0,5.0,We use this milk in place of baby formula because our son appears to have cows milk & soy allergies. It has been so much more convenient than the evaporated cans since I don't have to refrigerate until mixed.
9334,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,4.0,"Waterpik has good pressure, nice that its adjustable. I like that the head pivots so that you don't end up with a tangled mess of tubing. I havent used 5 of the 6 tips they sent with it and am having a hard time finding regular replacement tips for a reasonable price. Still, it beats string floss, especially for tight spaces between crowns."

Had a huge pimple forming on my chin the night I got it, applied a dab with a qtip, and the next morning it was down to nearly nothing!

9337,Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush,0/0,5.0,"I bought these for my entire family. My three kids NEVER brush for the full two minutes, so this is great because it won't shut off until the two minutes are up. The batteries they come with don't seems to last that long, but when I replaced them with Eveready batteries, they last a long time. Very good deal."

9342,The Family Guy - Stewie Football Head,0/0,4.0,"The Stewie football shaped head is smaller than what it appears on pictures, but its durable and softer than a football. It can be used to toss around for fun or as a decoration in the room for a Stewie fan, but cannot be used to play an actual game of football. Good showpiece, with that expression of Stewie."
9343,My First Lab Duo-Scope Microscope,0/0,5.0,This is a great microscope and has enhanced the science lessons of my grandsons who are home-schooled. They are using it weekly.
9344,"ChuckIt! Medium Ultra Balls 2.5-Inch, 2-Pack",0/0,4.0,"These are fantastic balls for a raucous game of fetch. Easy to grip in the mouth of even a little terrier. So far, they have withstood all our pup's attempts to gnaw them into shreds. MUCH better than the standard tennis ball with its easy-to-rip-off skin.My one gripe is that the provider was slow on the delivery end of things. I'm a regular Amazon client and have gotten used to the usual 1-3 day delivery. We received the toys 6 business days after the order. A six day turnaround and delivery of something was normal until the late 1990's......but, that day is gone and to be five star in my book, fast delivery is essential."
9345,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,It keeps the cats busy & hopefully away from the furniture. This is the second one I have bought. The first one is still in use. We have 6 cats.
9346,HALO Big Kids SleepSack Wearable Blanket Micro Fleece,0/0,5.0,I've been a big fan of the halo products from newborn swaddles up through these walking blankets for toddlers. This is a must to keep our kiddo warm through the night as she is a blanket kicking squirmer of a sleeper. The upside down zipper helps keep it on during the night. The only negative is that the foot cuffs have gotten a bit pilly through either wash or wear (she keeps her feet through & not tucked in & they are still toasty warm).
9347,Marpac Dohm-DS Dual Speed Sound Conditioner,0/0,3.0,"This was what it was advertised to be. However, it did not solve my problems with sleeping. Nothing wrong with this product. It certainly does what it was advertised to do."
9348,Jobst SupportWear Ultra Sheer Knee High,0/0,2.0,We got one pair erlier that was fine. Bute then we ordered again one pair and that was already loose in the upper portion and was useless for us.
9349,"Aurora Plush 12"" Perry Flopsie",0/0,5.0,My 7-year-old is into peacocks and wanted one for Christmas. She saw this one and decided she wanted this one. She is still super happy with it. It is very cute and the quality is nice.
9350,Energizer-Eveready 00916 NH22NBP Rechargeable Battery,0/0,5.0,This battery is working great in my metal detector after charging it to 1oo% before every use.Use only if you can quickly remove it for charging between uses.Remember that these do not last as long as non rechargeable batteries.
9351,Rubis Stainless Steel - Slant Classic Tweezer,0/0,5.0,"I sent this item as a gift to my Aunt. I have purchased several over the years as gifts and they have all been well received. I received one as a gift many years ago and am very impressed with this products. Most tweezers loose their ""spring"" effect. This one never has. I really like this product and would recommend to anyone who has use of a tweezer."
9352,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,3.0,"Overall it is a good litter box, where you don't have to dig around for litter clumps anymore like it's a treasure hunt; you just tilt the litter box to the right and sift out the litter, leaving the big clumps. After you clean, just tilt it back and you have cleaned the litter box!The only thing is, it's not really 'self-clean' like it is advertised. Maybe I am not using it correctly? In addition, it is not very easy to lock the lid and bottom in place (it just doesn't fit together perfectly) and also the 'filtering out' process still does not get the tiny poop specks out."
9353,"Carlson 0930PW Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door, White",0/0,5.0,"I wanted to get my Aussie out of his crate due to the fact that he grew much larger than my last Aussie. He has more room in the kitchen now. I had to tie the cat door so it only opened half way for my cat. I never knew a 60 lb. dog could get through such a small opening!I like the way the company included extra side pieces to make the gate wider if necesary. Nice and sturdy, easy to get through, and the gate opening has an easy lock in case your dog figures out how to pop the latch! They really thought of everything!"
9354,"3M Littmann Classic II S.E. Stethoscope, Orange Tube, 28 inch, 2812",0/0,5.0,"this was well built , good quality, packaged well, I would recommend to anyone this product , Quality , Great"

9358,"Hydro-Sponge Filter I--HS910 - Aquarium Technology, Inc.",0/0,3.0,"In order to clean sponge filters, you need to boil them.These, however, boiled a little too much. The plastic warped off of them and stuck to the bottom of the pan. :(Wonderful for smaller tanks though!"
9359,Merrick Mediterranean Banquet Dog Food 13.2 oz (12 Count Case),1/1,5.0,"I do not want to contradict what the other reviewer wrote, but my black mouth cur absolutely loves this dog food. I have not purchased it from Amazon yet, but I will since their price is really good on this food. My biggest suggestion for seeing if a dog would like this food or not is to only buy a can or 2 unless you know someone who would take the rest off of you before you buy a case of it. I think feel that merrick is a very high quality food, and I have never had an issue with it. I highly recommend this food."
9360,"Crystal Radio Experiment Kit,",0/0,2.0,"The instructions are vague and outright wrong at several points. If you do not know your electronic symbols and a little about electrical circuit theory, you are going to be challenged to get this working.Certainly not something children could assemble alone as an educational aid like Crystal Radio Kits should be. But it does work once you figure everything out. Just don't expect much from an audio/tuning standpoint. This is an experiment in radio theory, not a pleasure radio. At best you may faintly hear one or two nearby stations. But, that is not the point. The point is how radio waves from miles away are able run a radio receiver with no other source of power.This is very similar to what WW2 prisoners of war created in their prisons to monitor allied radio signals. You can construct one of these the size of a cigarette pack and the only manufactured item you need is the diode. If one could sneak in a diode (the size of a 1/2&#34; piece of pencil lead), everything else can be fashioned from everyday materials. Pretty amazing!"
9361,Zero Fog Blaster - Silver Blaster w/Fluid,0/0,3.0,"Opened it up and tried it before giving to my son as a birthday present. Upon opening it looked like there was a little moisture in the smoke tans, so I don't know if this was a return or just defective. I like the sounds and glowing lite, but the smoke rings were why I purchased the item.."
9362,"Rainbow Light, Multivitamin",1/1,5.0,These are great prenatals. They do not upset my stomache. The dose if 4 capsules daily so it allows you to take as little or as much of the product as you want up to the full daily dose. I switched to these because my old prenatal was constipating me. This one does not constipate me and actually seems to help with a movement. After about a week of switching to this prenatal i started to have regular movemements again. I have been taking two per day and supplementing just with a folic acid and a fish oil capsule for DHA and omega 3's. Great product. You can feel good about taking it too as it's organic.
9363,Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac with Insert and Strap,0/0,3.0,"People were right, if you have those wings on the edges of your seat, this isn't going to fit nicely. Mine comes out so much that I lose the ability to lean back and feel the backrest of my chair. Also, the strap is way too short to fit around my car's seat. Will probably return."
9364,NAUTICA COMPETITION For Men By NAUTICA Eau De Toilette Spray,1/1,5.0,"The design of the bottle is different but the smell is the same. My first time trying Competition was in the form of a Christmas gift by my aunt before she turned cheap and started handing out gift cards. Being that I'm allergic to various scents, I'm picky as to what i wear......typically safe scents for me are CoolWater, original Curve, Sexy for him, CK one, Polo Blue, Nautica Lat/Long to name a few. So i tried looking for Nautica Competition after nearly a decade after using up my first bottle. Found out that the department stores stop carrying them cause Nautica discontinued the scent. Which explains why everyone is leaving reviews that they're so cheap. Sad to see it be discontinued though, a very soft yet clean scent that got a lot of compliments."
9365,Nature's Way Capsicool Cayenne,0/0,1.0,"It gave me the worst gastritis, Being hispanic/middle eastern I am used to very spicy things and can tolerate cayenne pepper powder just fine. The color was off to other pills I have seen. I honestly do not recommend this product. Beside the pain it caused me, it didn't give me any energy."
9366,KAL DHEA 25 MG TABLETS,0/0,4.0,"My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/f4308 ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told the resveratrol one of the new 'wunderkind' natural compounds. Its powers include:1. Anti-fungal, anti-yeast, anti-viral.2. Antioxidant - promotes glutathione.3. Increases longevity.4. Protects against Heart disease, Alzheimer's and type-2 Diabetes.5. Anti-inflammatory.6. Protects DNA, stimulates repair genes.7. Protects against cancer.8. Kills cancer cells. Prevents metastasis.9. Aids Chemotherapy results, whilst protecting healthy cells.""So, tell me what it cant heal?"" I asked. But whatever I had a try. One cap lowers my blood sugar from 130 to 110. And energy, cholesterol levels ie. skin tone, weight loss, mental alertness are all better after taking for several months. My husband says this has helped his joints feel better. Best deal around so far. Highly recommend!"
9367,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,"My 1yo Brussels Grriffon/Schnauzer mix escaped our old plastic crate, but Houdini hasn't figured this one out yet. The latch didn't seem very secure, but 1 month later, still no escape. Good deal for the price."

9369,ELLEN TRACY For Women By ELLEN TRACY Eau de Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,"Excellent price, great perfume. I love this scent, hard to find in stores. Paid much more a few years ago in department store."
9370,"Prilosec OTC Acid Reducer, Delayed-Release Tablets",0/0,5.0,"I have suffered from GERD since I was in my 20's. (I am now 69.) Prilosec works better for me than Prevacid, Nexium, Zegerid, or any of the other products I have tried. I am taking it every day. I worry, however, about its proved side effects. Apparently, this drug and others like it cause a loss of calcium and consequent breaking of bones in the hip, spine, and elsewhere. Since I have osteoporosis as well as GERD, I am anxious about my dependence on Prilosec. Despite this serious risk, I am taking it daily so that I can eat and sleep normally. I think that objections to the packaging are foolish. Remember what happened with Tylenol! I'd rather have my tablets a little hard to open than worry about their being contaminated by vandals or manufacturers of competing products. The packages within the large package permit me to carry around a smaller amount everyday. The greater safety and the convenience of the packaging fully justify the slight difficulty of opening the pills."
9371,Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Moist Wipes - 224ct,1/1,5.0,"Of course I'm not writing about the perfection of a Porsche or a Corvette, these are just wipes after all. But wipes that separate or develop tears while you're using them would definitely be a problem. These are not. They hold up and do their intended job perfectly. Absolutely no hesitation in recommending them."
9372,Cocoa Butter - 100% Pure,0/0,4.0,"I melted this down, according to the instructions. I then used a scale and measured out 1 ounce portions. After the 6th ounce, I was left with only half an ounce. So I checked the container, and nothing was left. Nothing on the lid.. :( I mean it is what it is, but the container says 7 ounces.. not 6.5. I know it's only half an ounce, but I'm still bummed."
9373,"Stash Green/White Tea Blends, 18- or 20 Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,I love this tea. It has a wonderful flavor. Stash is a great brand and I love their other flavors too.
9374,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,0/0,3.0,"My Norelco shaver is at least two years, and I have never changed the heads. I thought this would dramatically change the shaving speed/how it felt, but it really didn't. It's also way more expensive than it seems like it should be."
9375,Carb-BOOM! Energy Gel - 24 Pack,0/0,5.0,"Carb Boom works. It's a good supplement I use on a double workout day. i.e. going from weight training to a Zumba class, or from a spinbike to Zumba . I will be be using Carb Boom this summer while on our pit crew during the Nascar and ARCA season."

9381,"Rembrandt Toothpaste, Intense Stain, Mint Flavor, 3-Ounce Tube",0/0,4.0,This is great toothpaste really whitens. The reason I give it a 4 is because of the tube. I have arthritis and it is too stiff to bend. I know I have to get one of those devices to get the paste out. The other thing is there is very little in the tube. I never run out of the toothpaste so fast.
9382,Jarrow Formulas Alpha Lipoic Acid 100mg,0/0,5.0,"Jarrow formulas do not disappoint me. I've used other brands but keep coming back to this one. It's hard to really feel the difference in many products and you don't know what the difference is supposed to be, but I really think I can tell the difference with this anti-oxidant. It's good stuff."

ThanksIt is great for colds and stomach problems. I use it mostly as a cough drop for colds.When you have that itching in your throat you should try this.
9387,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,This is a nice Water Flosser. I have been using it since my purchase and so far I have no concerns.
9388,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,0/0,5.0,"Best investment I ever made. No Oder, easy to use, for one cat it lasts about 20 days. The only thing I would like to see is the box area be at least 2 inches wider and longer. I have a large cat, even though she can use it it would be more comfortable a bit larger. I would highly recommend this product."
9389,Andis Small Pet Clipper Combs 9 Piece Set model #12860,0/0,4.0,"These fit perfectly on my Andis Clipper but quite honesly, I like the plastic ones that came with the clipper set when I purchased it. The metal set is a bit hard to snap on and off but they do work and I'm very happy that I've found these replacements."
9390,"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack",0/0,4.0,"I have purchased these breast shields twice, they are that good! the only reason i have it 4 of 5 starts is the cups with the ventilation holes, i tend to forget that when there is milk in the cup, i can't bend over, there by spilling milk in my bra and shirt. not a biggie, so just know that these shields will save your nipples from soreness and cracking!"
9391,Duro-Med Relax-a-Bac with Insert and Strap,0/0,5.0,I bought this pillow to relieve my back pain while at work. It worked so well at the office I ordered another one for home. This pillow fits me like it was custom made and I have had no back pain since since getting them.
9392,"Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black",0/0,4.0,"This sleep mask really works. It completely blocks out the light. I also like how there's space for your eyes to comfortably engage in REM sleep. The earplugs are a bonus as I also have problems with noise and they're made to fit anyone's ears. The only problems I have is I wish there was a better way to secure these other than using velcro straps. They get stuck on things. Also, the mask can get kinda hot when you're wearing it, but other than that I love it."
9393,"KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Red",0/0,5.0,Its a kong. the best dog toys there are. fill it with peanut butter throw it in the freezer and when i leave i pout it in the kennel and it keeps the dogs busy for hours.
9394,Das Foods Hawaiian Black Lava Salt- Sea Salt 6 Oz Jar,0/0,5.0,"Have tried many colors and love the taste of this particular salt. Not as salty as most table salts, but adds a great presentation factor which becomes a topic of discussion when serving, for example, with sliced mozzarella"

9402,Biochem Ultimate Fat Metabolizer,0/0,3.0,"I bought these and took them daily for a week. They work good surpressing the hunger and even for a couple days after discontinuing use. They are, however, too big. I can barely swallow them and cutting them doesn't help. I would also not recommend keeping them near your face/in your mouth as they smell and taste horrible(kind of like dog food)"
9403,Pro Vitamin Complete Liquid Vitamin 30 Oz Bottle,0/0,5.0,"thanks i enjoy doing business with you all,keep up the good work.the iitem was in good shap, every thing was on time"
9404,"Traditional Medicinals Organic Weightless, Cranberry, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I tend to bloat easily and have tried water pills in the past and absolutely hate them (rather bloat then take the pills). I came across this tea when I was buying the detox and smooth-move tea from the same brand. After the holiday bad food eating.....I put on an easy 10 lbs (5 of it probably water weight). I had to get some quick herbal help. Thanks to this tea, I feel great. Each time I take this tea along with the detox tea, I feel there is no water retention, at all. I can't live without this stuff (in the winter months only)....so I finally just ordered 6 boxes from Amazon because the local 'Target' store that carries this cranberry tea cannot keep it in stock. Around Valentines day I kept on going back to see if it was in stock and it surely wasn't. The last time I bought it, from Target, the girl behind the counter who rang me up....was telling me how she loved, loved, loved this weightless tea (I was like, 'I know, I know')."
9405,Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,0/0,5.0,"I have the facial hair growing capabilities of a thirteen year old despite my being roughly twice that age. The product performed exactly as I would expect it too and the multiple tools it came with were icing on the cake, even if I really don't need a beard trimmer."
9406,Rutland Prod. WI-00710 Williams Stove Polish,0/0,5.0,"I got this as an alternative to my regular tartar fighter toothpaste. My teeth don't feel clean after I brush, but they sure do sparkle. I guess it's a trade off you have to be willing to make."
9407,Deva Concepts Deva Curl No Poo Conditioning Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"I love the smell of Deva Curl, and I love that my hair is not frizzy any more. This is a great product!"
9408,Corningware French White Cleaner And Conditioner,0/0,5.0,I use this to clean the lighter colors of my Fiestaware. It doesn't remove the scratches (nothing will) but it does a fabulous job removing the &#34;gray&#34; marks from flatware. Highly recommended!
9409,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",0/0,2.0,"The pieces do not fit together snugly when assembled. The slide-out waste collection tray leaves gaps that litter falls from when rolling the box to clean. It is very heavy and awkward to roll and, although I tried to clean after first day of use, the wet litter stuck to the bottom of the box and did not fall into the collection tray. So I decided just to remove the lid and scoop the waste as I would for a normal covered box. However, the two pieces of the box do not fit together well, and after several times removing the top to clean the litter, the latches are virtually impossible to line up to get the lid firmly in place. I would not recommend this product and would instead buy another litter box like the second one that I have which has a hinged lid that you can lift up to clean without totally removing it."
9410,"Candy Runts, BUY BULK, Wholesale Prices, 5 lb. bag",0/0,2.0,I had read other reviews and knew what to expect about the candy coming in a plain plastic bag. That was fine but the bag was then placed in a too large box with no padding and during shipment the bag busted. I had to go to the trouble of returning the candy and it was wasted when all it would have taken was for the company to place it in a smaller box or have added some padding material.
9411,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"My cat, who tends to lose interest in toys rapidly, still loves this one. He loves stalking it and trying to attack it! Another benefit is the length -- it allows you to keep your distance from your cat's claws/teeth."
9412,Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps,0/0,4.0,"I could eat a whole bag of these in one sitting. They are an awesome snack! However, after recently being diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (and learning that it is very important to watch my intake of potassium, phosphorus and salt), I corresponded directly with the manufacturer. I learned that the Crisps are very high in potassium, which is not something allowed on my new kidney diet. I always thought that the FDA required food manufacturers define ALL of the nutritional facts on the label. Potassium is not listed. There are 760 mg of potassium in one serving (which is about 1/3 of the bag). I am disappointed I will have to stop eating the Snapea Crisps."
9413,"Hodgson Mill Caraway Rye Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)",0/0,1.0,"I'm giving up! I tried this mix exactly as instructed, and it never rose... I tried a new package of yeast (tested on other bread first) and still no action... I tried it with a slow rise method and nothing. I proofed it in the oven, only to waste more time and energy trying to get this bread to rise, and nothing has worked. Attempting to bake resulted in a flat dead loaf.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, otherwise I am done with Hodgson Mill bread mixes. This was a waste of time, energy and money!"
9414,Emerita (Pro-Gest) Pro-gest Cream,0/0,3.0,"I'm sure this works great for those who can get past the odor and the stickiness. Unfortunately, I just can't justify the use of a product I find rather unpleasant to use. Bummer."
9415,"Merkur ""Futur"" Safety Razor, Satin Finish",0/0,5.0,"As some other reviewers have said this is the cat's meow in shavers.A word of warning though, this will slice you like the finest surgeons scalpel. I consider my face sensitive however even the 1 setting be ware this will drop 10lb slices off your face if you aren't careful. After all the surgical warnings though it does an exceptional job if you don't race to the end and set any speed records. Steady as you go start on 1 and believe me you will be quite pleased with this razor!"
9416,Avon Solutions Nurtura Replenishing Cream,0/0,5.0,"This cream is nice but on the thicker side. I love how it feels on my skin but I will not need to be using it daily as a night cream. It works great for dry patches anytime as well. Try this cream if you have very dry skin - you will see results immediately. I don't care for the smell, but I don't hate it either."
9417,"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",0/0,4.0,"These do a good job keeping me dry during the day, but constantly move around at night, which is when I really need them."
9418,Grab Bar Chrome Knurled,0/0,5.0,"I made this purchase for my dad. When I recieved the items, I was very happy to see the item was exactly what I expected to be. Once it was mounted, I came to the conclusion that Amazon is the way to go for online shopping. Thanks!"
9419,Melissa & Doug Full-Body Ballerina Puppet,0/0,5.0,"Our little one fell in love with this puppet in a toy store and practically wore it out, because she wouldn't put it down. We bought this one as a backup so that we wouldn't be faced with tears when the first one eventually got &#34;loved to death.&#34;"
9420,Space Marine Command Squad Warhammer 40k,0/0,5.0,"I gave this item 5 stars mainly because there were no missing pieces to the set, no damaged pieces or anything alike. The set came in the mail in a box within a bag with bubble bags around them for security. Great set to add to any space marine army! Plus it was cheaper to buy it off of Amazon then at a local hobby store but only if you are also buying a few other items due to shipping and handling"
9421,Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads,0/0,5.0,"Replaced the heads and it made 100% difference. Razor is like new again. Don't buy a new razor, just replace the heads."
9422,KidKraft Limited Edition Toy Box,0/0,5.0,"I was looking for a toy chest that will last as long or longer than needed. This one is sturdy, well made and easy to put together. I would buy it again and we may to have one at Grandma's house."
9423,Batman Dual-Compartment Lunch Kit by Thermos Insulated,0/0,4.0,"I love this lunchbox! It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but I have not had any trouble fitting my lunches into it even with my unusual sized Tupperware. I don't see much purpose to the zipper bottom &#34;secret&#34; utility belt compartment and think it would have been better if that extra two inches was just extended to the main compartment, especially because it can make the bag rather soft at the bottom and want to tip over a bit. Besides, it's a Batman lunchbox, how cool is that?"
9424,"Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews",0/0,3.0,It is hard to tell if something like this is beneficial; but my doctor recommended I take it for cloresteral control
9425,Mon Cheri Liquor Filled Chocolate Covered Cherries 30 count,0/0,5.0,Back in 1990 I had an exchange student from Germany his Parents introduced me to Mon Cheri. It was love at first bite.I have been craving them since then so after 20 years of searching I found them on Amazon.The same wonderful taste I remember thank you Amazon.com for making a dream come true.
9426,Aquanil Cleanser,0/0,2.0,This product is probably fine for most people but I have very sensitive skin and I broke out after using this for a few days.
9427,PetSafe Telescoping Aluminum Wall Entry Pet Door,0/0,5.0,We have two dogs. A Chihuahua and a Bechion. We bought the medium size and it works beautifully. We taught them to go through with treats and it took about 4 days before they didn't hesitate at all to use it. It was easy to install and looks good. So happy we made this purchase.
9428,Freeman Freeman Facial Clay Mask Feeling Beautiful Avocado & Oatmeal,0/0,2.0,This clay mask doesn't do anything for my skin. and also it has a funny smell. I don't recommend it.
9429,Clear Crystal Ball 110mm,0/0,5.0,Hefty and mysterious - there is so much depth to this. It is perfectly polished and clear and arrived in excellent condition. It somehow manages to be intriguing and restful at the same time.
9430,Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Soccer Ball,0/0,5.0,"My &#34;son&#34;, Archie aka &#34;Hammy Piggles&#34; loved this (I am behind on updating this by a year, he passed away a few months ago from Osteosarcoma :((. Hammy loved this toy, it was great to throw, it had a hole in it so you can throw it far, it has a refreshing minty smell so your hands won't smell like doggy slobber. It can't deflate which is GREAT and why I researched this product and bought it. Also, for him easily destroying things, it held up exceptionally well... It got a few minor bite marks but he had it for over a year and never had any tears."
9431,JJ Cole Urban Bundleme,0/0,5.0,baby shower gift for my new great granddaughter...mother loved it...didnt want the usual pink...it matched her graco disney stroller perfectly.

9436,Country Life L-Lysine with B-6,0/0,5.0,"I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Country Life L-Lysine w/ B-6. It was a great price for product, and shipped to me VERY quickly. I am a very happy customer! Thanks so much!"
9437,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,1/1,5.0,This soap is wonderfully energizing and has a very refreshing aroma. It's also very concentrated so a single bottle lasts over a year. My skin and face are in great condition so I can see no downside. Perhaps you would prefer a soap that ran out faster so that you could enjoy a variety of fragrances? Perhaps you find the powerful cooling sensation unpleasant? Perhaps your method of applying soap to yourself is incompatible with such a concentrated soap? These are the only reasons I can think of for not enjoying this soap.
9438,Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,0/0,5.0,"I love the material and the colors! I can't compare it with other ring slings, since this is my first one, but I really like this one. I ordered the Sailing print, which is an open tail. The open tail works great for breastfeeding or shielding baby from the sun. My son is now 13 months and around 20 pounds, and his favorite position is the hip position. I use this sling to go to post office or doctors, when I need my hands free. I like the fact that it has padded shoulder area and one side where baby sits. It can be adjusted, so my husband can wear it too. It washes just fine on a cold cycle. The rings look very sturdy and safe."
9439,Bvlgari Aqua Pour Homme Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,would recommend to friends and family. Getting complements from the ladies price was the lowest I found from box stores and internet
9440,GIVENCHY POUR HOMME BLUE LABEL For Men By GIVENCHY Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,I've used the blue label before. Excellent fragrance. My wife loves it. My friends and people who don't know ask about this fragrance all the time. Lasts all day.
9441,Cincher Women's Posture Back Brace Support Belt - White - Medium 34-38 Inch Hip,0/0,4.0,Product works well especially if you do quite a bit of lifting however I only gave it 4 stars because the upper back doesn't provide as much support as if the shoulder blades were also supported.
9442,Lafes Natural Body Care Deodorant Spray,0/0,4.0,"For starters, it doesn't make my armpits itch, so that is a huge plus. It has a good smell and lasts about the same as regular deodorant. I just wish it dried faster, but perhaps I'm spraying too much at once. It's not really spray and go, but I guess that is the price to pay for natural deodorant that doesn't itch!"
9443,Classic Tin Kaleidoscope,0/0,5.0,"My neice loved this as a Christmas gift. She didn't understand it, but she loved it. hopefully as she gets older she will also understand it."
9444,Kelo-cote for scars,0/0,5.0,. It is a wonderful product. It is just as picture! I am very very pleased with this purchase. Thanks !

9446,"Just for Men Shampoo-In Hair Color, Light Brown 25, 1 application, (Pack of 3)",0/0,5.0,The price was right. The color and coverage was satisfactory. I like shampoos better than comb in. Seems to be less messy with short hair.
9447,Sequence for Kids,0/0,5.0,We've had since Xmas and already it's a massive hit. My son has played for hours and we've bought a second one to keep at Granny's house!!!!
9448,Kleinert's - 24 (12 Pair) Disposable Underarm Dress Shields From Kleinert's From $4.79 to $24.99,0/0,3.0,"I purchased in hopes of extending my wardrobe during a three week trip to Europe. Unfortunately, the shields are too thick and wide to work for light weight or light colored fabrics. They do work nicely for business suit jackets worn over sleeveless blouses."
9449,"Lipton Black Tea, Loose, 1/2 pound Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"To get the full benefit of tea, try using loose tea; you get cut leaves and not the dust that falls on the floor that goes into tea bags. LIPTON loose is a fundamental tea that offers a full bodied &#34;blue collar&#34; impact. I mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with Yorkshire GOLD for a pleasing blend of classes."
9450,Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer,0/0,4.0,"It arrived to me on time, BUT it wasn't able to cut the hairs on my face.I took it to my Barber, who had to have the Blades adjusted.He said for the most part, that is how the machine comes to the customer"
9451,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,2.0,"I have two large dogs and it is very difficult to trim their nails with this trimmer. I have to apply a lot of pressure to get it to cut through their nails. The nail guard is nice, but for my big dogs, it does not allow me to cut off enough nail. I feel like these would be great for small dogs but not big dogs."
9452,"IRIS Plastic Exercise / Containment Pet Pen for Dogs, White",0/0,5.0,"Great for a little 5 lb chihuahua. I ended up buying another one (just using 2 panels from it with a complete one) because I felt like the litter box was too close to the bed. It looks nice in my bedroom. I don't know how well it would work for a big dog, but mine and sometimes her 2 siblings are fine in it. I definitely recommend this."
9453,Colgate Colgate Full Head Toothbrush Classic Soft,0/0,2.0,"I wanted a soft toothbrush. This one would be medium by my standards. I guess there are no official standards, maybe there should be."
9454,"Now Foods, Pycnogenol 30 mg",0/0,5.0,I read about this in a book about aging skin. They recommend that Pycnogenolshould be taken for your skin. I have been taking it for about a week and I haven'tseen any difference yet but I would think any new product takes about 30 days.Dr Oz also recommended it on his program.
9455,Scott's Cakes Milk Chocolate Pecan Bark in a Decorative Box,0/0,4.0,"This bark was good, but it was not as good as the white chocolate pecan bark. It seemed that the white chocolate bark had larger pieces of pecans in it compared to the milk chocolate. I prefer larger pieces of pecan nuts."
9456,Ortho Bed Wedge,0/0,3.0,Too tall for knees and feet to sleep with or rest with. I'm not sure how else I could use it.
9457,Q-Gel Mega 100 (100mg Hydrosoluble CoQ10),1/1,5.0,"Q-Gel Mega 100 was prescribed to me by, essentially, two of the leading physicians in the country who treat the condition I had (fortunately both here in town). The symptoms that this product deals with were unusually quick muscle fatigue, slow recovery from exertion, generalized muscle weakness, and unusual and occasionally painful tightening of muscles at rest. Not fun. While CoQ 10 is the indicated supplement for treating these problems, they both told me that Q-Gel Mega 100 is far and away the product with the greatest bio-availability. (With most vitamin and supplement products, a significant amount of the desired vitamin, mineral, etc. is filtered by the kidneys and is literally flushed down the drain. ""High bio-availability"" means much less flushed down the drain and less stress on the kidneys.)The results of using this product were entirely satisfactory. Over the course of treatment I recovered completely. While the price might seem high, the results I realized make this a flat-out bargain.Personally I would not recommend taking this (and most other vitamins/supplements for that matter) without the advice of a trusted, KNOWLEDGEABLE physician, pharmacist or PhD in the field. Then, when CoQ 10 is indicated, this is hands down the best available formulation of it.As the old tag line said"
9458,"The Art of Shaving Brush Stand, Black 1 ea",0/0,5.0,This was back ordered after Christmas. But great product. No reason to spend any more money. They sell these for higher prices at the mall. I would buy online.
9459,Squigle Enamel Saver Toothpaste,0/0,5.0,"I've always used Colgate, AquaFresh, etc and I've never been as satisfied as when I first tried Squigle just last week. My mouth felt fresh and clean! I've always cleaned my mouth with other products and it always felt like a daily routine of cleaning and it felt &#34;fresh&#34; but never that cleaniless feeling. I would always hop around products hoping I would end my search for a good toothpaste and this one is a keeper! In 1-2 hours after brushing that feeling would go away as to when brushing with Squigle, I really feel clean all day. It's not the best taste in the world but it's also not the worst. I also combined this product with BreathRx http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000US2532/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_16 and my mouth feels superb!"
9460,Medela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags,0/0,4.0,"For parents of newborns, time is a valuable commodity. This allows for quick and easy cleaning, and is something that can be traveled with without taking up the space of your home based sanitizer."
9461,"Aerobic Life Mag O7 Oxygen Digestive System Cleanser Capsules, 90 Count",0/0,5.0,I bought this product as part of a program I am that required me to do a colon cleanse. It is AWESOME! There is no cramping or unpleasantness and its safe to use on a long term basis because it doesn't contain any unnatural chemicals. You HAVE to try it.
9462,"Nature's Plus - Animal Parade Chewable Grape, 180 chewable tablets",0/0,4.0,One kid said it tasted great and the other one ran to the trash to spit it out. So we'll see.
9463,"8"" Scopettes, Jr. ""Single Ended Large Tip 8"" Swab - box of 100 Applicators",0/0,4.0,Using the product as a caregiver. The Scopettes are not individually wrapped but they work really well. . .better than other swabs with less of a tip. The price could be lower since I use several at a time. Glad I found them!
9464,Lionel Polar Express Train Set - G-Gauge,0/0,5.0,"My 4 year old son is a huge Polar Express fan... it's his favorite movie and has sparked an interest in trains. He has another smaller Polar Express set that has been played with non-stop. The Lionel G-Gauge version is a wonderful upgrade! The train itself is a fairly large scale with good detail that is resilent for a younger user (the little video on the Amazon site doesn't do it justice). The sound effects are good, the lighting on the front and in the fire box are fun, and the overall opertion is great.There are a couple of minor issues on the negative. The track connections are okay, but a couple of the track section connection points had excess plastic in them that required some clean-up with a hobby knife. The only other minor issue is the train car connectors... for younger players, they are a little hard to connect and keep the wheels on the track.Regardless, this is a great set for any fan of the Polar Express! I am especially looking forward to setting it up around the Christmas tree... assuming I can get it away from my son!"
9465,"Pet Buddies PB5578 FurBeGone Cat Grooming Brush-TPR, Green",0/0,3.0,"I have 3 cats, 2 short hair and one long. Both my short hair cats enjoy me brushing them with this which is why I give it 3 stars. My long haired cat skirms to avoid this brush from coming in contact with him. As for it collecting hair it doesn't seem to collect much at all. Never tried to use this to get hair off carpet or furniture as I just use a vacuum for that."
9466,HAI Nu-Stik 1 inch Professional Ceramic Flat Iron,0/0,5.0,The Hai Nu-Stik Flat Iron was loved by my daughter some years ago and I believe she still has it. She is married now and has a little boy now. She loves it. Thank you.
9467,CHI Farouk Systems USA Infra Cationic Hydration Interlink Keratin Mist Leave In Strengthening Treatment 12oz/300ml,1/1,5.0,"First off, I have naturally loose curly hair. I color my hair so it had a tendency to get kinda dry. I only like to wash my hair every 2 to 3 days and this stuff is a staple in my routine. I wash and condition my hair, towel dry it, then lightly spray this through my hair focusing on the midsection to the ends. Then I apply chi silk infusion to the ends. It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down. I have used other leave in sprays and I would end up having to wash it the next day because it felt dirty. This is my new favorite product!"
9468,Clarifying Cleanser,0/0,5.0,"I started using this about 10 years ago and when they say, &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t BREAK it&#8221;, they&#8217;re referring to this as part of the daily regimen. I have incredibly oily skin and it has taken me a while to find something that works for me. I get multiple compliments and on my skin and people always ask me what I use on my face. A tube this size should last a few months with use twice a day. It smells great, you only need a pea-sized amount, it washes off makeup well, and leaves your skin with a healthy shine, the salicylic acid helps manage breakouts. I recommend using this with Dr. Murad&#8217;s Pure skin vitamin supplements to really kick off clearing your skin."
9469,Fisher-Price Potty On-the-Go - Gray,0/0,5.0,This has saved us so many times!! When children are little they just cannot hold it so having this with us in the car has stopped a few accidents!
9470,Bicycle Clear Playing Cards,0/0,3.0,Bought these for hubby to make a Euchre deck. He didn't like them. Personally I thought they were cool. No white parts to yellow or get dirty.

9473,Essie Spring '06 Collection,0/0,5.0,I was so glad to have been able to find this on Amazon. Essie discontinued it and I love it. I have used two bottles of it over the past several years and am sad to know this one will probably be the last bottle I will be able to find.
9474,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,0/0,5.0,"We have 2 friends with large dogs that pulled them everywhere. With the Gentle leader, they now have control and no more unwanted trips to the concrete from the pulling puppies. I highly recommend this product to anyone who walks a large dog."
9475,Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Baby Receiving Blanket,0/0,5.0,"this blanket is so soft, and the perfect size for when I am on the go with my little one. We don't go anywhere without it!"
9476,"Kyjen Puzzle Plush Egg Babies Dog Toy, Fish, 5 Eggs",0/0,5.0,I like this product my two Brittany spaniels do too. It would be better if it was more sturdy they ripped it up within a few days but they are very aggressive chewers so I would recommend it for people with dogs that don't really like to chew up toys. But they love the eggs those are very durable I am overall very happy with this product.
9477,"Herbalife, Herbal Concentrate Tea",0/0,1.0,"i have been searching a lot in this website but i'm wondering why i always can't see the expire date in the image,, that doesn't make any sense ???????"
9478,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,"This product performs as expected. I like the ability to vary the pressure of the wash incrementally. Pretty much once you dial in to the pressure you desire, you leave it at that setting and never adjust unless you perhaps decide to use one of the other specific heads that can be fit onto the unit. Those that have not used a waterpick because you thought it would be quite messy, I found it quite controllable."
9479,Auric Blends Perfume Oil,0/0,3.0,This sort of smells like a very mild egyptian goddess to me (another of their scents which I have used for years) so I like it. It's good for being casual as opposed to being a goddess.
9480,Zoo Med ReptiCare Ceramic Infrared Heat Emitter 150 Watts,0/0,5.0,Didn't want a bright light this time. I think my snake probably enjoys it better as well. It took a little more time dialing it on the heat...
9481,Stokke Xplory Parasol,0/0,5.0,This one is really beautiful and useful. And my daughter's stokke stays really nice with this one. When it's very sun it's nice to use it...
9482,"Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff Flour, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"We are new to the GF life, and have competitive runners in our family. Our nutritionist recommended Teff as a super-food, consumed by elite international marathon runners. While the price is higher than many other flours, Teff by the case is not unreasonable. It has a very earthy flavor, best when cut with other flours, unless you are making injera -- and this makes a very good injera. We tried the Teff muffin recipe on the box -- with apples and raisins added, it was yummy (very crumbly and dry otherwise). If you are looking for super-food for runners (gluten-free!), this is a good choice, but be prepared to experiment to get a taste/texture you like."
9483,"Pet-Tabs OF (Original Formula), 180 ct. (Made in USA)",0/0,5.0,I am so glad that this company solved its problem. My dogs did not like any substitute brand of vitamins.

9487,Contech CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent,0/0,1.0,A total waste of money. The so called &#34;Cat Deterrent&#34; did not deter any of the 25 cats that &#34;visit&#34; our home.

9496,Borotalco Powder 7oz powder by Manetti H. Roberts,0/0,4.0,"This is very nice powder, but I'm not sure it is any better than Johnson's Baby Powder. It is certainly much more expensive. The fragrance is no better and they both do the job."
9497,Pacific Play Tents Find Me Multi Color 6' Tunnel,0/0,5.0,"this was a great buy my grandkids just love it they have played with it for hours and hours they even wanted to sleep in it , it was on sale at a great price but would be well worth full price ,and best of all it folds up in seconds and gets put up untill they return but why they are here it does not get put up at all. great deal buy it."
9498,"Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, 34"" x 52"", White",0/0,5.0,It just does not leak. No kidding! And its nice big size means it covers almost all the sleeping area my toddler lays on (and it is soft enough to sleep on.) I bought two and always keep a clean one waiting for middle of the night accidents. You won't be disappointed.
9499,Melissa & Doug USA Map 51 pcs Floor Puzzle,0/0,5.0,My daughter was in 1st grade when she received this as a gift. She is in gifted classes at a school that does not start Social Studies until third grade so this was a wonderful supplement to keep her challenged but does not interfere with what she is learning at school.
9500,CranActin Cranberry AF Extract By Solaray - 180 Vegetable Caps,0/0,5.0,"As a woman, cranberry is great for keeping UTI's at bay, but this product is also beneficial for men. Since my husband began taking them, he sleeps through the night and no longer has to get up to go to the bathroom. A welcome relief after years of doing so. Solaray is my favorite company--a bit pricey on some items, but well worth the extra assurance I feel when taking their products. Never any hidden ingredients or fillers. We love the vegcaps vegetarian options they offer--we try to stay away from the gelatin caps as they tend to give us heartburn. A great product for men and women."
9501,"Col. Conk Worlds Famous Shaving Soap, Bay Rum (Net Weight 2.25 Oz)",0/0,3.0,"I would not call this a bad product, and the scent I felt was very pleasant. However I thought It needed a little more moisturizer. It is an Ok product but I found better and moved on."
9502,"Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Lamb Munchies Dog Treats, 16-Ounce",0/0,3.0,Nowhere does the product page say its lamb lungs. They sort of let you infer that it is a jerky product. But my dog likes them. I also got some Texas Hold Ems and they're also lung but thinner and my dog won't touch them.I've reordered these a couple times and they are consistent.
9503,"Carob Chips, Barley Malt Sweetened, 1 lb.",0/0,5.0,We use carob chips in place of chocolate in many recipes. This is a high quality product and I am glad to have a new source for this chocolate/sugar alternative.

Until I began using Eco-Dent, my teeth were sensitive to cold and hot. After the first use, I never had a problem with sensitivity again. Love the product!"

9514,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,0/0,5.0,"This Waterpix is EXCELLENT and I would highly recommend this model if you are considering purchasing a Waterpik for the first time.Pros/Cons:PROS:- it really works well at its task and is actually fun to use- it holds a generous amount of water- not too loud- has great storage compartment in the lid- the cord to the handle recoils back to the same shape and tucks back in just like the picture if you don't over stretch it- nice aestheticsCONS:- it can be messy until you can get the hang of how to let the water drool out of your mouth and into the sink- it's a bummer if you don't finish your routine before the water runs out. After a few uses you get into a pattern of how to clean your teeth fast enough then do retouching with the water that is left overI recommend keeping a plastic 1 to 2 quart water bottle filled with water in the bathroom where you use it instead of detaching the blue reservoir for a commute.OH! and after your done, rinse with mouth wash for an aggressive clean feeling.Also, I found that this product doesn't replace flossing all together because it can't really get between the teeth when the teeth are touching BUT IS MUCH BETTER AT GETTING BELOW THE GUM LINE COMPARED TO FLOSSING ALONE.I recently had a breakthrough in flossing more when I found the new REACH ACCESS FLOSSER! Regular floss is hard to work with in your hands especially if you have big hands.http://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser/dp/B0017TU2HE/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1"

9521,Christian Dior Rouge Dior Replenishing Lipcolor Lipstick,0/0,4.0,"I love this lipstick. I discovered it in Italy a couple of years ago and use it all the time now.The colour is great, a lovely neutral colour so you can emphasise your eyes and it can be used during the day or evening.I highly recommend it."
9522,"Food Science Labs - Aangamik Dmg, 250 mg, 90 chewable tablets",0/1,5.0,I've looked around for a good deal on this product and found it here. It's reasonable price and the item arrived as described.
9523,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,0/0,3.0,"I believe this product is well made, and for some babies it's probably a favorite. Our granddaughter, however, isn't crazy about it. She will use it sporadically, always smiling when the tether vibrates, but then she doesn't want it any longer. No soother for teething here, just a rarely used toy in her book. If they put nubby soft bristles on this, instead of it being a smooth finish, I think it would be a hit."
9524,Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"Bought this for Christmas (my daughter wanted Santa to bring a present for the kitty) and it's been in use for over a month.If it's not in use by the cat (who loves it), it's being used as a twirly-wand-thingy by my daughter (who also loves it). It's very well made and I haven't had any issues with anything breaking or fraying, but then again the one cat is fairly easy going. She bites it, claws it, chews it a bit, and I couldn't see her breaking it anytime soon.If anything, I will probably break it since I find myself trying to test it limits beyond what happens normally (like just bending the wand or playing tug-o-war with my daughter). I don't think the cat ever could damage it unless she just had free reign to chew it for an hour."
9525,Redmon Original Bongo Bag,0/0,5.0,"I bought this to replace a similar type hamper I'd used for years. I was very happy w/this purchase because of its size, sturdy construction, zip top, & heavy-duty grip handles. It holds lots of laundry, & is easy to wipe up w/a damp cloth if you want to freshen it up. This hamper is definitely a good buy, w/a price that's right."

9527,"Olay In-Shower Body Lotion, Age Defying with VitaNiacin",0/0,5.0,"Too often, I rush through a shower and don't take the necessary time to moisturize, especially in winter. Being able to moisturize in the shower is the perfect way for me to make the time for skin care and I'll often notice my softer, supple skin hours later during the day. It makes me feel good...like a woman likes to feel."
9528,Rainbow Light Men's One Multivitamin,0/0,5.0,These vitamins have the necessary vitamin A along with other essentials needed for a healthy male body. Well worth the money.
9529,"Tetra 77851 Whisper Air Pump, 10-Gallon",0/0,5.0,"Pump is as silent as it's name!Obviously, the pump must be placed on a firm surface and not make contact with ANY surrounding objects it is then really, really quiet.However, anything touching it, however slight, causes it to make racket.Don't know longevity but would buy again (at this price it would be silly not to)"
9530,"ChapStick, Classic Spearmint, 0.15-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)",0/1,4.0,I bought the huge package as a Christmas prank on a friend and it's truly cheaper to buy it this way than to even try to find them separately at walmart. My only complaint is I bought them maybe a week before Christmas and the expiration date was in March. I don't know if that's standard but it seemed a little soon for them to go bad.Regardless they arrived quickly and in their separate blister packs like shown.

I did not think they would work, but they are so nice! They make my hands feel excellent! I recommend compression gloves for anyone with arthritis in their hands!"

9536,Carex Bed Buddy,0/0,5.0,A few minutes in the microwave and this wrap is perfectly warm. The Velcro closure is strong and the fill is heavy enough to add just a little pressure to the muscle. I do wish it could hold the heat longer but it's only a minor inconvenience to put it back in the microwave.

Worked like a charm."

9554,Safari Professional Nail Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"I am a woman with small hands, my dog is a boxer mix with large paws and claws. These trimmers are a good size for both of us. I've always used guillotine style trimmers in the past but found them awkward. I find the scissor like action of the Safari trimmer much more comfortable. I adopted my dog when he was 10 months old and for the first year he didn't need trimming. When the time finally came that he needed it, my normally good natured, happy dog growled at me. I don't know if he'd had a bad experience in the past but I wanted to be sure he had no reason to fear the trimmers. So starting out I would just trim one claw followed by a treat and a lot of praise. I would not try again for a day or two and always just one. With the Safari trimmers I could always see where I was cutting and I could take small nibbles so it never hurt him. Pretty soon he was looking forward to trim time and he would hand me his paw. We have gradually worked up to doing a whole paw at a time. He does have soft, pink and white claws, which makes it easier. But I haven't had any trouble with these trimmers crushing his claws. I am very pleased with my purchase."
9555,"Charlee Bear Dog Treat, 16-Ounce, Liver",0/0,5.0,"Our dog loves these. Perhaps my favorite part about them is that unlike other dog treats, they are dry so you can put a few in your pocket while you go on a walk and not have to worry about stinking up your hands or pocket. That said, they aren't appealing enough to my dog to distract him from squirrels or other smells when we're on a walk!"
9556,Nail Thru Finger,0/0,4.0,"my 7 year old loves gags. this one lasted a bit longer than other gag gifts, and he loves getting &#34;packages&#34; in the mail from Amazon and it keeps him busy for a couple of hours and then he is done with them."
9557,DREAMATE SLEEP AID by HIVOX,0/0,5.0,"I bought this because I have had trouble sleeping and I am really a little surprised....but this thing works.It is easy to care for and if used properly, it works for me. I have found I fall asleep faster and even better yet, sleep deeper. I have also found that a couple of times during the day when I wanted to ""calm down"", I put it on and it helped with that too.I think Hivox markets this as a sea-sickness aid as well and I cannot vouch for that. I don't get sea sick but I have a friend who goes on cruises and I am actually anxious for her to try it the next time she goes.I have been using it for a few weeks and I have no rash like others have said (it states if you get a rash to discontinue use) and some people seem to say it hurts. It certainly does not hurt me. It seems to me if it hurts that a person has a REALLY low tolerance to pain. I started with it on the lowest setting and have moved it up to about the middle now.So far, I am very happy.It is not a total ""wear this once and you will sleep like a log"" but it is a device (strange as it may be) to assist you in getting better sleep.If you don't like it, I am fairly sure you could return it but I would recommend people try it out. I am sure everyone is different and maybe it won't work for you but like me, maybe it will and for $50, it has already given me, what I consider to be, it's money's worth."
9558,Heart Shaped Reusable Heat Pads - Red,0/0,5.0,"I love having one of these around. Simple instructions.The box it came in doesn't match the product which is slightly disconcerting, but the pad is as pictured."
9559,Dermalogica Dermal Clay Cleanser (select option/size),0/0,5.0,A wonderful clay cleanser for oily or acne skin. It is great at controlling oil and minimizing mid-day shine. With long term use it helps to eliminate acne and the production of clogged pores.

9566,SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post,0/0,3.0,"I bought this cat scratching post for my cat for Christmas. She had completely annihilated her last one. She absolutely loved scratching it. So I thought that a more heavy duty one would be best for her. Just like a lot of other reviewers, she did not take to this post right away. I read in another review to put a dangling toy on top of it to entice her. Unfortunately that didn't work. Eventually ( almost 2 months later) she started scratching it. Not nearly as much as her last one though. I'm hoping that she'll become more accustomed to it and scratch more and avoid scratching the carpet. On the plus side, this post is very easy to assemble and tall if you have a big cat."
9567,Our Pets Signature Series,0/0,5.0,I would REALLY recommend this product if you are in need of something like this. I was very pleased at how sturdy and how well this product is! GREAT BUY!

9570,"BaByliss Pro BAB2590 Porcelain Ceramic Straightening Iron with Removable Comb, 1.5 Inch",0/0,5.0,"I was a bit skeptical about this flat iron since it was so expensive, but I decided to give it a try since I could return it because of Amazons return policy. Well anyways, this is the best flat iron I have ever used!! It was a little comb attachment on it that replaces the need for the ""comb chase method"". The comb is like a wide tooth comb, and it doesn't pull or snag on the hair. Its a very clever idea, plus it gets those ends that can sometimes become hard and tangled with a regular flat iron. The comb attachment is remarkable!This iron gets hot quickly, but there is no flashing light or indicator that lets you know that it has reached the temperature that you set it at. Beyond that, I have no other complaints. I sold my Sedu to get this, and it was well worth it.Babyliss products are better than I thought, I may check out their other items because of this fantastic flat iron. I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to those who have hard, kinky, or hard to straighten hair. The temperature gets up to 420 degrees. Its wonderful!5 stars!!"
9571,Now Foods Erythritol Natural Sweetener,0/0,5.0,Being diabetic my sugar intake is restricted. I used this for baking and was extremely pleased. The only drawback is the price. The package says it is vegan.

9577,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap,0/0,5.0,"Our 13 year old cockapoo has incontinence problems, especially as we are about to go out and have to use an elevator to get out from our condo. So, this wrap is terrific. The medium fits him with no problems. He is 20 pounds, and it pulls tight enough to ensure no leaks. The Velcro is so strong, that it takes 2 hands to pull it off once we get outside.For best results, and to minimize the need for washing, we use 2 super maxi pads as liners. This way is he starts to go, we can let him finish, then pull off the wrap, and remove the liners before it gets to the wrap.So long as you position the wrap correctly, it does not leak. So, human error is the only problem here, not product at all.We highly recommend this product."
9578,Yakshi Fragrances Roll-On Fragrance,0/0,5.0,"If you like the smell of sandalwood, you'll love this. It might smell slightly different in the bottle but once it's on the skin the fragrance comes alive. Reminds me of the sandalwood soaps from India."

The one I got from the medical suppy was $58.00. What crap. This is more comfortable and WAY less expensive. I am able to wear this through the night. It's not a joy to wear, but this is as good as an uncomfortable product gets."
9580,Multi Voice Changer by Toysmith,0/0,2.0,"My daughter HAD to have this toy....so Santa did her due diligence and checked reviews online, found a good price on Amazon and secured this silly toy. It doesn't work that well. The voices all sound about the same and you have to speak directly into it for it to work at all. My daughter hasn't picked it up much since Christmas. Parents? I'd leave it. There has to be something comparable out there that actually works. Great idea, terrible execution. Pass this one."

White Toplayer, Moderate Absorbency, Soaker Ounce 8oz., Each,PINK",0/0,4.0,"I got these to protect my bed from a cat who occasionally thinks it's a good idea to pee there. They do what I expected--absorb and don't leak through. For some uses I think they would need to be thicker, but they do say &#34;moderate absorbency&#34; which is correct and fine for my present purposes. In future however I might get thicker ones just to have more reserve capacity. They wash and dry very well."

I used to use tampons, but would have to wear a liner along with it because I would leak all the time even after only an hour's use. With the Diva Cup, I have never had a leak. Yes, you have to get over the whole &#34;Ew I'm touching blood from my vagina&#34; but honestly, you don't get that grossed out by snot do you? Same concept. Every woman should have one of these. They're easy to use, easy to clean, saves you money, and is good for the environment. I really don't see a downside to this wonderful product."

9598,Pearl River Bridge Mushroom Flavored Superior Dark Soy Sauce,0/0,4.0,"Rich, brown caramel, umami flavors. It has no ordinary mushroom flavor, although it does have some almost sour dried shiitake flavor. This is better than supermarket soy sauce, but I prefer Koon Chun Double Black soy sauce (Koon Chun Double Black Soy Sauce) which is less salty taste-wise and based on the nutrition label statements."
9599,Source Naturals Optizinc Zinc Monomethionine 30mg,0/0,5.0,"I like these zinc. I was taking another brand that was 50mg and I wanted to go to a smaller dose because I also take a multi-vitamin and don't want over do it. These are just the right at 30mg.

9602,"Year Without a Santa Claus 12"" Snow Miser Plush",0/0,2.0,"The Snow Miser 12&#34; plush doll is very nice, but the shivering mechanism stopped with the first pull on the string. We purchased this product in January in anticipation of a grandchild's birthday in late February. We did not check it out until two days ago and found the problem. Although our grandchild will undoubtedly like the doll, it is disappointing that the mechanism does not work."
9603,Esphera 360 6 DaVinci Code 240 Piece Glow,0/0,5.0,"I own several from both Ravensburger and Esphera. All are very well made. Most of the times I buy one just because I like putting it together. This one is a little different because I enjoy the book. It looks cool, I have it right by my computer."

9605,"Vigorelle Natural Female Enhancement Cream, Albion Medical",0/0,1.0,I wouldn't recomment this to even be on the market.It don't work and is a waste of money and decieful selling. Wouldn't recommend it all and have nothing good to say accept take it off the market. It stinks also.No thanks
9606,Very Irr&#233;sistible Givenchy,0/0,3.0,"Great fragrance with notes of peony and musk. Unfortunately, though, the staying power is pretty bad. For that reason I don't recommend purchasing this."
9607,"Ancient Harvest Quinoa Organic Pasta Gluten Free, Elbows, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)",0/0,5.0,"Where some gluten-free pastas only work in some recipes, I've found this particular quinoa macaroni fits in marinara, cheese sauces, and other recipes. And where many gluten-free pastas disintegrate in cooking, or take ages to reach a palatable level of doneness, this one cooks well and quickly. This one has a robust flavor, al dente consistency, and tastes even better than durum semolina pasta. If you have to go gluten-free, as my household did, this product will keep you from feeling deprived of the pasta you love."
9608,China Glaze Nail Lacquer with Hardeners,0/0,3.0,"This product is good, I just was not as satisfied with the color as I would have liked. But the product was shipped fast and it is of good quality."
9609,Gold Medal Formula 30 with Cardoplex Whitening Shampoo,0/0,5.0,"My local pet store no longer carries this brand and I was so happy to find it again on Amazon. I have used other whitening shampoos in the interim and although they all whiten there is one important thing this shampoo accomplishes. Your dog will definitely dry FASTER with this shampoo hands down. I have one dog with silky hair and one with curly hair and they both are brindle and white. It works perfectly for both dogs and they both do not like to be dried so this definitely reduces any stress they experience.My dog with the silky hair texture benefits from the conditioner and my other dog doesn't require it. You need to use very little product to get a good lather and a bottle of this shampoo is long lasting, I ordered multiples to get the free shipping - it is my favorite shampoo of all time. To those sensitive to scent, this is extremely mild and pleasant. I don't think you will regret this purchase or any other Gold Medal product as I also have used their sprays."
9610,"Haribo Gummi Candy, Peaches, 5-Pound Bag",1/1,2.0,"So I read a lot of the reviews and debated whether to order these or not. I am pregnant right now and obsessed with anything peach flavored. I love the Peach Rings that I buy fom the store, they are soft and the peach flavor is great and some people said in their reviews they were similiar, but they are not! When you open up the bag you are hit with an amazing smell of peaches, but the candy itself did not live up to expectation. To me they taste kind of rubbery and have an after taste that I don't really care for. They are not soft enough. The peach rings I usually buy also have a lil bit of a sour taste along with the sweet which I like. These are almost too sweet. I have this huge ziplock bag full of them and now I wish I would have just saved my money and bought a few packs of the peach rings I love. Not really worth it."
9611,Snoozer Console Pet Car Seat Cream Fur,0/0,5.0,This pet car seat is perfect for my 5 pound yorkie. She loves to ride with her head resting on the front edge of the car seat. It fits nicely on the console although I did add an extra strap to secure it.
9612,Alka-Seltzer Alka-Seltzer Cold Formula Effervescent Tablets Cherry Burst,0/0,5.0,"My husband and I have been loyal Alka-Seltzer customers for several years now. This product will provide you relief from your cold symptoms without making you feel like you have taken medicine. You will not feel tired, dizzy, dehydrated, etc. So you can feel free to take Alka-Seltzer even if you have a busy day of things to accomplish. We also love the flavor. It's actually a good refreshing drink, not like a cough syrup that you have to cringe while you drink it. Can't live without it!"
9613,Counter Force Knee Wrap,0/0,5.0,i love it! helps with the pain. movement is better.the wrap is wonderful. does not hurt or bind. would reccoment to everyone.
9614,Petsafe-Dog Kennel,0/0,1.0,"I purchased this item to fence in a six-month old puppy who weighs about forty pounds and is a calm-mannered sweetheart. I read reviews before purchasing, and while one stood out as alarming (the dog who was strangled in the gap at the door) the rest seemed fairly positive, and I knew I could adjust the height of the door to prevent it from being lifted up enough to squeeze a head into.I've worked construction before, and wasn't impressed with the quality of the chain link, which was already in a state of unraveling and had to be rewoven in places. I was even less confident in the metal ties provided to secure the chain link to the frame, and so after attaching them all at the recommended intervals (every five diamonds on the bottom) went through with security grade zip ties and secured in between all of those as well.Best estimates put it at fifteen minutes after I left, my dog escaped. The horrible quality chain link was a cinch for her to unravel and create a hole almost large enough to slip through unharmed. I say almost, even though she did slip through, because she sliced open a large gash about five millimeters from her eye. Fortunately, our backyard is fenced in, so she just hung out there all day until my wife got home, and is now recuperating with some neosporin.I want to send this back for a refund, but I'll need to wait until this weekend to disassemble it completely, and then since it weighs 165 pounds and is a giant awkward mess, it's going to be an enormous hassle to return. I'm extremely disappointed in this product. The other option would be to line the entire inside with chicken wire and cinder blocks, which is going to add a considerable additional expense to this already overpriced piece of junk."
9615,Rene Furterer Karite No Rinse Nutritive Concentrate,0/0,1.0,This product was diluted and did not work like my last container of this which I got from another resource! I am sure it was tampered with!
9616,Amazon.com,0/0,5.0,I love this costume on my dog. My cocker spaniel / golden retriever mix was absolutely adorable in this costume. We have pictures to prove it :)
9617,L. Erickson USA Small Pony - 100% Silk Charmeuse,0/0,5.0,"When I want a pony but not a big pink bow all over the back of my head this is my go to. It has a lot of elastic, and doesn't break my hair."

9620,"HeadSlick Shave Cream, Mentholated, 8 oz.",0/0,4.0,"This stuff is incredibly good for shaving your head, and is by far the slickest cream I've ever tried. This almost kills razor tug to nil and is great for shaving you head, or anything else that needs a good razoring. However, I can't fully recommend it, because this stuff smells like dumping your head in bucket full of distilled coughdrops."
9621,Vinyl Mattress Protector 6 Gauge - Zippered (9' depth) Twin Size,0/0,4.0,"My decision is based on the purpose why I bought the product, not expensive and adequate for my need. Nothing to complaint about it!"
9622,"Great Northern Popcorn, Portion Packs (Pack of 24)",0/0,5.0,"I have to preface this review by stating my first job was at a movie theatre. I have been addicted to Theatre popcorn ever since. But trying to recreate it at home has always been a challenge. Even through I knew what it took, to gather all the ingrediants in one place took time. Finally I now have everything available to make the best popcorn outside of the Movies.My husband was a sweetie this Valentines and picked up a Great Northern Pocorn machine as my gift. Let's just say I was elated and floored. This wasn't the table top model, but the full on floor version!! I know...awesome, right? Did I mention how much I LOVE my husband!When i first used it with my own coconut oil/yellow salt/ popcorn it was tasty but something was not quite right. So searching I went. There were a few other versions of these prepackages out there, but I needed something that would cover the 8 oz of our popper, wasn't too expensive and I could buy in bulk. Heck agt this point I could open my own popcorn stand!Easy to use, with a cavet. If you are using the same popper as I have (see above). It's a little tricky to get everything in the popper without some spill. Also my popper requires you to heat the oil first then once heated pour in the popcorn and salt. I definately lost a few kernals the first time. I also have a small cusineart popper someonw gave me as a gift many years ago and received almost daily use (see my other reviews) and this pack works great with that version as well. Even a little easier to get started, but makes a crazy amount of popcorn for that unit. Would have to get the 4 oz packs for that to make more sense.All in all, fantastic tasty popcorn for those non butter/oil lovers out there. I also picked up the &#34;butter&#34; to complete our experiance. Now to look for a butter topping dispenser that doesn't cost a arm! Good luck popping."
9623,ID Glide Sensual Lubricant - 9.5 oz,0/0,4.0,"This is my first time buying lubricant and I was afraid that it wasn't going to be as great. But it was! My boyfriend and I loves it. We have fun with it! Great, fun gift for someone as well."
9624,Thayers Witch Hazel After Shave with Aloe Vera,0/0,4.0,"Stings if you have cuts though so beware. Id buy this again, but I wouldn't recommend it if your shaver cuts you a lot, you'll be in a world of pain."
9625,Tri Ecollogen Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,5.0,"Tri, which is pretty exclusive to salons nowadays, is a shampoo I've been using all my adult life. The Ecollogen shampoo really leaves your hair soft, highlights it beautifully and rinses very cleanly. The texture is wonderfully smooth and I can only hope I can find a similar deal in the future. I've been spending much more."

9627,"Hyland's - Ipecac 30c, 160 pellets",0/0,1.0,I'm not satisfied .1) It doesn't have enough description.2) No clear and actual photo.They should write a very specific details and more actual photo for the item.3) The delivery date is very far from the day I bought the item.4) I received my item in the last day of estimated arrival days (too late).Thank you.

9630,Witch Hazel w/Aloe Vera Toner A/F - 11.5 oz. - Liquid,0/0,5.0,Good toner doesn't have to be expensive. This one is the best for me and it is cheap. Highly recommend it.
9631,Shaving Cream - Unscented,0/0,4.0,"This was the stuff that made me say goodbye to pump bottle shaving creams. Overall a great product, but even with the smallest amount of brush to apply it lasted me at least 4-6 months. I'm a repeat buyer. I do with the cost was under $20 though."
9632,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,"The product was about 1/2 the price as in pet stores or my vet. Feliway is an excellent product to begin with because it works well and has no oder. Low price, immediate delivery, great product. Can't lose."

9635,Amber Butter,0/0,5.0,"As other reviewers have mentioned,there is not a lot of product included in the package, but a little goes a long way. The carved wood canister has a screw on lid, and will be perfect to keep small treasures when empty. I love the incense-like smell, and am planning on purchasing more when this runs out. Arrived very quickly from Tom's ~~. Price was reasonable for cute little luxury."

Okay, I have more to say"
9643,Hy-Tape - The Original Pink Tape,0/0,1.0,"I did not order this thru amazon but I have such a strong dislike for it that I felt I need to share. I decided to try this and ordered thru my insulin pump supply company. I had issues with other tapes sticking and getting rashes (like tegaderm, IV 3000, hypaflix, etc) that I wanted to try this since it claims &#34;adheres securely to skin that is wet, oily or hairy, yet is still gentle on delicate skin&#34; and &#34;waterproof&#34;. I have tried it several times and it does not live up to its description. It falls off after I shower (thus not waterproof), and with in a hour after putting on dry skin it is falling off. It does not stick well at all. Save your money and get something else. I went back to tegaderm."
9644,Master Massage Adjustable Rolling Stool,0/0,5.0,"Comfortable seat, easy to put together and makes bodywork a lot easier. Wheels roll smoothly and change directions easily even on thick carpet."

9648,Pampers Baby Dry Diapers (Packaging May Vary),0/0,3.0,"I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."

9650,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake Mix, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"No one in my family is gluten-free, but I have several friends and acquaintances who do maintain gluten-free diets. I love to bake and don't want to leave them out. I have only had rave reviews for cupcakes made with this mix. Both those who eat gluten and those who don't say that you absolutely can not tell this is gluten-free. The flavor is great and the texture is light and fluffy as cake should be. The only downside to this mix is the cost; it's rather pricey. It is less, though, than buying all of the separate gluten-free ingredients, when one does not consistently bake gluten-free."
9651,"Herbalife, Herbal Concentrate Tea",0/0,4.0,"I love this tea and it does seem to suppress my appetite. I guess the only down fall is that I feel it is very expensive for tea, but I do really like it and easy to make. does not taste like a concentrate at all"
9652,National Geographic Microscope 103-pc. Set With Carrying Case,0/0,1.0,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my 7 year old son and after putting the batteries in, we were all so excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it's exactly as what previous posters said - completely useless. You can't see anything at all, I've taken everything apart to see if there was something blocking the eyepiece but nothing really worked.What a disappointment."
9653,Step2 Crabbie Sandbox,0/0,5.0,"My grandson saw this at a neighbors over Christmas break (he will be 2 soon), he loved it...naturally, if he loves it, we want to enjoy it with him so we purchased it. It was a big hit, at first he was a bit nervous about walking on the sand but after an hour, he was sitting and playing with his Small World Toys and we were having a blast! For kids who are not crazy about playing in the sand, this easily doubles as a sitting pool and when he gets older, has no more use for it, grandma can plant sand plants and sit on the porch reminiscing about the happy days when her special love shared sand cakes with her for lunch! This is a life long purchase and good investment."

I use these to put in thyrosafe pills and gave one to each family member to always have on them. I had the red one on my keychain. Apparently the bottom part came unscrewed. I have an extra one, thank goodness. For the price its a good buy and the colors are cute, my kids swooped up on them fast."

It reminded me of cotton candy and whenever I spritzed it on, I was given loads of compliments.After researching, I found out that my fave scent was close to $100 a bottle. This would not do. So I turned my attention to websites. Lots of research later, I found the scent here for only half the price it retailed for!

9671,"Jason Natural Cosmetics - Aloe Vera (Super Gel) 98%, 16 fl oz gel",0/0,2.0,"This gel is very sticky and sweet, also seems not completely absorbed (50% is absorbed and 50% dry on the skin surface and then seems to peel).I had to mix it with other creams, in two equal parts (mix with cream for very dry skin).It also works better if you mix it with drops of essential oil or olive oil. (5 drops of oil per arm or leg, if you still feel sticky or syrupy, to the next (the next day after the bath), repeat the formula but with more oil until you get the desired sensation."

9677,Reviva Brown Spot Night Gel w/ Gylcolic Acid 1.25 oz,0/0,3.0,"Normally when I would use a Glycolic cream on sale at Ross, I could tell it was improving my skin. This one I can't tell any difference and the first few times it seemed like it actually contributed to pore clogging. It's possible I'm beyond hope at this point (hormonal acne makes everything feel like it doesn't work).The other thing is the smell. It's a subtle and non-chemical smell that's mildly annoying. I have aloe and I know it's not the aloe that smells like that."

This has a distinct smell to it, I don't know how to describe. It tracks less than clay but you do end up with small bits of pine when kitty is overzealous with his burying. Doesn't do the best job of masking odors.ETA - this used to be on Amazon subscribe and save but was dropped. Now I don't purchase on Amazon because I can find it elsewhere for less. Amazon was so much easier than putting a 40-lb bag of cat litter on the back of my bike!"

9685,Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments,0/0,5.0,"I've had this trimmer for a few months now and it is nice !!! I was used to cheap trimmers that got clogged up if you were cutting more than 5 individual hair, and that overheated when used for more than 2 min. This machine really rocks ! It just plows forward and doesn't get hot (just a tiny bit warm). It feels nice and heavy duty (doesn't have the empty plastic bottle sound when you tap it, the wire is heavy gauge too). It is slightly noisier than the cheapo things but you'll be done in a couple of minutes so you noise exposure will be limited.I'm taking good care of it and hoping it'll last a long time !"
9686,"Nature's Path Organic Millet Puffs Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",0/0,1.0,"I hated this item's taste. I do like Nature's Path Puffs a lot, but these Millet Puffs I will be throwing them away."
9687,Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,0/0,5.0,"We bought two, one for each carseat in our two cars. They fit well and we haven't had a problem with it sliding down. It has protected our car's leather fine. I haven't checked to see if the seats leave indentations in our leather seats, but it wouldn't matter anyway. I rather our car seats be firmly secured and leave indentations, then not."
9688,"Pacific Chai Decaffeinated Vanilla Chai Latte Mix, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)",0/0,2.0,My own version of a Chai Latte was better than this
9689,"Snellen Eye Chart 22"" L x 11"" W",0/0,5.0,"This Snellen Eye Chart is the same one used in doctors' offices. It's great if you have a room that has a straight line of sight 20-feet long and you want to check your vision at home if you have a chronic eye condition, such as a repaired retinal detachment, Macular Degeneration, etc."
9690,"Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Microwavable Popcorn, Tender White, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,o.r. has the very best popcorn ever as well as the only one that offers white which is what I grew up on and love. since i was a little girl I have eaten a bowl of o.r. almost every night and now I am 66 yrs.old and am still doing same.

9695,"Traditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"Not drinking it because it's good for me so much as I just like the taste. What a refreshing tea this makes when you can drink so much green, white, and peoke teas over a long span of time. A very nice change."

9698,Dmso Gel 70/30 Aloe Plastic,0/0,5.0,"I got this as a last ditch effort to get rid of nagging pain in my left shoulder and hip from sports. I was skeptical at first, read all the research available and purchased this product. After receiving it I (almost immediately) put it on my left shoulder. I expected a garlic taste in my mouth (per the research). A few minutes later I noticed that I had full mobility in my shoulder which is something I can't say I've had in a long time. This stuff seems to be the real deal. Just tried it on my hip as well. The pain was almost immediately (I know it sounds cheesy). Worth a try don't you think?"
9699,Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric,0/0,5.0,We have a 2yr. old Pit Bull and he absolutely loves this bed. We use it in the backyard and our dog loves to lay under the sun. Would definitely recommend this. This bed can fit 2 large dogs.
9700,White Diamonds By Elizabeth Taylor for Women Eau De Toilette Spray,0/0,4.0,"Yes, I am giving 4 stars to the product itself because it deserves it. But Never again will I buy perfumes online. This is the 4th bottle that is now sitting on my dresser, useless. Bought from different online companies. Not just Amazon.Fragrances bought online DO NOT smell anything like the ones bought in store. Why? I have no clue. But that has been my sad experience for the last few months. Disappointment after disappointment. Money and time spent and lost.Yes, it is cheaper than buying in store, but the trade off just isn't worth it for me. All the money wasted on 4 bottles would have been sufficient for one at the store that I wouldn't be disappointed with.If you've never used a fragrance before buying it online, you probably won't notice the difference. But If you have, as I have been, using White Diamonds for years, this has been such a headache! It just does not smell the same as the one bought in store. Period."
9701,Green Jeans By Gianni Versace For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces,0/0,5.0,"Green Jeans cologne for men, is pretty good, I like most of the Versace fragrance, and found this one a little cheaper at Thefragrancefactory.comheck why spend more if you dont have to."
9702,FC Female Condom 15 Pack,0/0,5.0,"Works as it should, but a note here you much use a lot of lube and keep using lube. More lube the better it works."
9703,White Plastic Jar with Dome Lid 4 Oz - 12 Per Bag,0/0,5.0,These jars were more than I expected them to be for the price. Perfect size and very sturdy. They worked perfect for my homemade body butter and I would highly recommend them.

9705,CAESARS WOMAN For Women By CAESARS Cologne Spray,0/0,5.0,"I originally purchased this perfume at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I immediately fell in love with the smell. But when I ran out, and I couldn't immediately travel to Las Vegas, I turned to Amazon to pick up my favorite perfume. I must say, I was pleased with the price and the product itself. Wonderful!"

9713,"Kirkland Signature Mature Adults Multi Vitamins & Minerals With Lycopene & Lutein, 400-Count",0/0,5.0,I stated using this when I bought it from kirkland. I found out that with amazon it was cheaper and I received it before I would have gotten over to costco. For a multi it is a good as any out there.
9714,"Solaray - L-5-Hydroxy Tryptophan, 100 mg, 60 capsules",0/0,5.0,"I love this product, and I believe this brand (solaray) has worked better for me then just buying brands from walgreens or cvs. I am very happy with this product. it has helped improve my mood and makes me feel more positive. the first two days I felt a little drowsy off them but that effect did not last for me. I take them 3 times a day, one pill at a time, and the definitely perk me up. I have had a lot of problems with anxiety, and just feeling worn down, and this has made a significant improvement and id recommend them to anyone who feels the same. the caps are smooth and easy to swallow, and have a pleasant smell. this came in the mail quickly and on time. if youre just looking for something to uplift you a little bit this may be right for you."
9715,Cardinal Gates Door Guardian,0/0,4.0,"No door damage, keeps the kids in. I love this product, it is not unsightly and you can keep it up after the kids are grown. When you want to remove it you just need to fill in a few holes in the door jam."

9717,Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer,0/1,5.0,"My husbandman says it's his most favorites trimmer ever, and he's gone through a lot of them. It does a fabulous job and holds a charge for a long time. he can use it a few times to trim his thick beard before he has to recharge it, and it's a powerful little bugger. Would definitely buy it again, especially for the awesome price."

9722,BareMinerals Eye Shadow,0/0,5.0,I have been using this makeup for years and I must say it is the most natural looking on the market.
9723,"Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats",0/0,5.0,Great for training my cane corso. He does both basic training and protection training and he exercises for at least a half hour afterwards so these are great. We do this twice a day and he never gets tired of the treats. The treats are different sizes as some complain but I just tear up the larger treats so I don't mind. The price is great b/c my corso is 70ls now and will get to 140. He can pound through the treats.
9724,Educational Insights Micropro 48 - Piece Microscope Set,0/0,5.0,"I love this, its easy to use, comes with everything you need and is just a lot of fun to use!"
9725,"Rogaine for Men Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil Topical Aerosol, Easy-to-Use Foam, 2.11 Ounce, (Packaging May Vary)",0/0,5.0,grrrrrrrreat! umm... i enjoy the product. it works. it came in the mail fast. item came as described online. yay!
9726,Peek and Seek Seaport Jigsaw Puzzle Game,0/0,5.0,My 5 year old son loves the peek and seek puzzles and I was happy to find another one on Amazon. He especially enjoys figuring out the picture clue cards and then finding the items in the completed puzzle. I gave him this one for his 5th birthday and just bought another one for a friend's 5th birthday. Both orders arrived promptly.
9727,Mane 'n Tail Deep Moisturizing Conditioner,0/0,3.0,"i like it an all but i jus didnt realize how small the bottle actually was when it arrived in the mail. came in early, so that was good, and it definitely keeps your hair soft all day. but seriously, for the price, its not bad."
9728,Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster,0/0,5.0,I bought this for my niece and I love it! It's easy to assemble and take apart to clean. The only thing I was disappointed about was the item was $5 cheaper at baby r us. My fault should of checked before purchase. Overall it's a must have.
9729,"Feliway 48-Milliliter Plug-In Refills, 6 Refills",0/0,5.0,"I read other reviews, and thought they were exagerations. For my cat however, this product has worked perfectly. What a relief."
9730,Black Opal Daily Fade Cleanser Creme,0/0,3.0,"The old Black Opal cleanser, pictured above, was 5 stars. They discontinued it for a couple of years. Now it is back with new reformulation in contents and new packaging. Old ingredients were green colored, healthy scent, and it felt and looked like it stimulated the skin; now contents are white, smells like old 1950s cold creme, and has way too much perfume. It exfoliates ok, so far."
9731,"Source Naturals - Vinpocetine, 10 mg, 60 tablets",0/0,1.0,Another supplement that may be air in a capsule. i would save your money as this product did nothing then stick on the way down.
9732,Fat Cat Kitty Hoots Big Mama's Scratchy Box Double Wide Purple,0/0,5.0,My cats love to use this and I love them to use this instead of my furniture. Would definitely purchase again. Am thinking of purchasing the kitty ramp. As I am typing this my kitty just jumped on the scratchy box to use!!!!
9733,Munchkin Stay-Put Suction Toddler Bowl with Lid,0/0,3.0,"I really like that these bowls have a cover. With a 13 months old, it's pretty certain that he'll leave food. That aspect helps reduce our food waste, and I don't have to transfer food from a bowl to another storage container. My primary reason for buying these bowls, was the suction cup though. Plates and food tend to get dumped during dinner, and I wanted something that would prevent that. When the bowl is first placed on the high chair tray or table, the suction is awesome. As dinner goes on though, the suction cup lifts off of the table and the bowl is just as easy to move as a regular bowl. My husband and I are just in the habit on pushing the bowl back down periodically, but there are times food and bowls still go flying."
9734,"Richell Wood Freestanding Pet Gate, Large, Autumn Matte Finish",0/0,5.0,i bought this model and the 94135 &#34;small&#34; version from richell. i'll repeat what i wrote in the subject line
9735,Fisher-Price Bath Center,0/0,2.0,"This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the ""seat"" or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest."
9736,Tinkertoy Classic Mini Set,0/0,1.0,"This is nothing like the classic. I spent 1000 hour playing with my tinkertoys in the 70s. This new style is cheap, useless garbage. It is not compatible with the old style sets. The tolerances on the manufacturing are all over the place so some parts fit fine and others just fall out. Plus the price is a ripoff. Anyone who was involved with bringing this product to market should be fired."
9737,Swap The Swift Swapping Switching Slapping Card Game,0/0,2.0,Reminds me of Uno...but not. Makes no sense and I would not recommend it. My grandkids didn't like it either.
9738,"Elemis Deep Cleanse Facial Wash, 6.8 Ounce",0/0,2.0,"Within a few months of starting the product, which works great, it started to smell and soon turned rancid. I mean, how does a cleanser go bad? Seems it contains milk products. Nowhere can you find info on using within a certain time frame or keeping refrigerated."
9739,Source Naturals Lecithin 1200mg,0/0,1.0,"i received a defective bottle of these pills. not sure if one burst, a manufacturing problem or what -- but when i opened the package and took out my first pill it was very sticky and oily. checked the other pills and they are all the same. no sign of a broken pill. of course i didn't take any of them and am returning the product. i am reserving judgement and have ordered a replacement bottle because the other reviewers have not complained of this same problem. have hopes that this is an isolated instance."
9740,Now Foods Astaxanthin,0/0,5.0,I was told by my wholistic nutritionist to take this because it is good for many things! I've been taking it for a few months. Not sure what it is doing but I feel great!
9741,Energizer Max Alkaline Batteries,0/0,5.0,"It is always a good idea to buy branded batteries in my opinion - they last about what you expect them to last, and then some more, unlike bargain brands that are spent within a few days. These Energizers hold up to their reputation and the expectations one has of them."
9742,Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate,0/0,5.0,"I bought this gate for my dogs, and it is perfect. I keep it up in my doorway and do not regret it at all. It is tall, easy to put together, sturdy, and overall a great gate. I think the only feature it is missing is that it doesn't stay open on it's own, but it would depend on who you are asking (some people would prefer it close on its own instead). However, this gate never claimed to stay open on it's own so it is definitely not a fault. If I find myself in need of a gate again, I would purchase this one."
9743,Source Naturals L-Carnosine 500mg,0/0,4.0,Seems to work. But I take about 30 other supplements so I really don't know what is working. But feels clean and good going down
9744,Cassini Perfume by Oleg Cassini for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,1.0,"This perfume is rancid. The date on the Unwrapped box says 1990. I don't know if it's actually that old, but it has definitely gone bad. I'm familiar with the perfume and I know what it should smell like and it's absolutely not this. Am going to attempt to return it."
9745,Medline Bariatric Bath Bench without Back,0/0,5.0,"Since I use the shower stall more than shower/tub combo, I needed something to sit on--awful arthritis makes standing painful. I'd been looking for something smallish because of the limited space and sturdy. This is it. It is kind of short, but at it's tallest setting--17""--it works. The shortest setting was too short for me (I'm 5'1), so fortunately it adjusts. The only thing I had any difficulty with was adjusting the legs. I've used the button adjust mechanism before, but this took some elbow grease. That's one of the things that made really like it--it's sturdily built and I don't see those locking buttons slipping. One more thing. I know this isn't supposed to be the place to discuss delivery, etc.--but wow!! I ordered this stool yesterday and it arrived today--less than 24 hours later--fully assembled in a nice light box. Perfect for me having to move it myself. I highly recommend."
9746,Cat Dancer 101 Cat Dancer Interactive Cat Toy,0/0,5.0,"and for such an inexpensive simple gadget it has brought so much fun. So basic, but then again you can buy cats the most expensive kitty condo and they'd rather sit in a newly opened Amazon box.......Pattie"
9747,Frog Juice,0/0,4.0,"I got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. The instructions are really confusing but once you play a few rounds, you get the hang of it. Even my 5 year old son loves to play this game. It is definitely different and not like other card games. Fun for all though."
9748,"RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream, 0.5 Ounce",0/0,2.0,"I've been using this around my eyes twice daily for two months now - I've seen no change, no improvement. The cap is annoying and product leaks out."
9749,Nature's Plus Orange Juice Chewable Vitamin C -- 500 mg - 180 Tablets,0/0,5.0,I have been using tis product for about a year and am glad I have found this distributer on Amazon. This product is such an easy to take Vitamin C. I take it with my liquid calcium which I have heard is the preferred way to take calcium. That is when taking Caclium it is necessary to take Vitamin C with it so it absorbs into the body easier.
9750,Midwest iCrate Single-Door Home Training and Travel Series,0/0,5.0,"We got this crate for our mini Dachshund, and it's a little too big, but he loves it :) It has enough room for a couple toys and a dog bed, and so far, it's holding up great! Highly recommend :)"
9751,Instant Heat Curling Iron,0/0,1.0,"Initially I thought this iron was great but after less than 6 months of very light use & good care, the power button is not working. I tried changing to a different heat level & that worked a couple of times but now is completely dead. The power button appears fine so there must be a short wire inside the iron. Boo! This makes me wonder if Amazon.com receives defective items hoping to sell cheap? According to amazon, Ibought this less than 6 months ago. Disappointed!"
9752,Joico Joifix Firm Finishing Spray,0/0,5.0,I have used Joico products for years and I'm never disappointed. I was also happy with the timeliness of the order.
9753,"Now Foods, Xylitol",0/0,1.0,"I used this once to sweeten my homemade toothpaste. I can't use this stuff as a food product, my system just doesn't like it. (Like your 94 year old, lactose intolerant great uncle just ate all the creme fraiche in France...yikes!) I swear, I ran the cat off! It works well as a toothpaste sweetner, but I could never use it for anything else and have since stopped using it at all .My one star rating is aimed at the product and my results after use. It has nothing to do with Now Foods as a company. But for the sake of humanity and global climate change.... I won't ever use this again!"
9754,Passion Perfume by Elizabeth Taylor for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,I love the product. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so. No complaints at all.
9755,Melissa & Doug Maggie Leigh Magnetic Dress-Up,0/0,4.0,Wish there was a cover/case for these magnetic dolls by Melissa and Doug. Melissa and Doug always make good quality toys. They seem to enjoy the gift.
9756,"Medline Plastic Medicine Graduated Cups, 1 Ounce (Pack of 100)",0/0,5.0,I bought these for measuring resin bases. They are the perfect size for measuring out small and medium pours. I looked at a similiar product with fewer cups at Costco and the price was significantly higher. These are durable enough to meet my needs and at such a good price I don't need to clean out multiple messy resin cups.
9757,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap,0/0,5.0,I have always used this to bathe my dogs once a month. We live in Colorado and they never get oily or dry during the year. This is a good balance to use on them and the almond is gentle and clean smelling. It makes me feel great to use on them because I know exactly what is in the bottle. I use it as a body wash for myself and my skin is much happier than when the several other moisturizing soaps I had tried.
9758,"MG217 Medicated Tar Ointment, Psoriasis Treatment, Intensive Strength, 3.8 oz.",0/0,5.0,I really don't know about this psoriasis type stuff and I do get it on my feet from time to time and this really seems to help with flare ups and its not that bad of smell nor greasy. I like it so far! AAA+++
9759,"Choice Organic Teas Black tea Russian Caravan-Smoky Lapsang Souchong Tea,16 Tea Bags, 1.1 Oz (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,"I just discovered that Numi no longer makes their Smokey Tarry Tea.....What to do? Well, I ordered this and I like this better. What a fine tea with just the right amount of smokey flavor!"
9760,"Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch",0/0,5.0,"Why did it take me so long to discover this air brush. I have fine hair and have been growing it out for the past couple of years. Have had short hair my whole life so learning how to manage shoulder length is new. This brush has made a major difference, love it."
9761,Star Nail Pen-Style Polish Corrector,0/0,3.0,"I just wish the tip was sharper. I can correct bigger areas like the sides of my nails, but when it comes to near cuticle, not so great."
9762,"Duro-Med Wheel Chair Back Pack, Black",0/0,4.0,"Theoretically, this would work for carrying small loads of laundry, a jacket or etc. However, I do find I rarely use it by myself, as it is not easy for me to twist around to reach it. Once I am well enough to venture out with a friend, it might come in handy for storing my sweater or for purchases that someone else could access for me. Right away, I tucked the flap around, as that is just one more thing in the way."
9763,"Aurora Plush 12"" American River Otter Flopsie",0/0,4.0,Very cute and soft. Great quality for the price. Keep in mind that the nose and eyes are plastic and not suitable for a very young kid because of chocking hazard.
9764,"Pamela's Products Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies, 7.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",0/0,1.0,"These are terrible. Very dry, crumbly(in a bad way, the reviewer who said ""powdery"" is spot on), blah in flavor. They really don't resemble traditional chocolate chip cookies at all. Literally found them hard to swallow. Really sparse on the chocolate chips too! Lame!"
9765,Organics Hand & Body Wash,0/0,5.0,"This is a very good product, with a subtle rather than an overpowering scent, absorbs into the skin quickly, and makes it pretty soft and supple. Not too liquid, not too greasy - just right!"
9766,"Tazo Awake Tea, 24 Tea Bags",0/0,3.0,English Breakfast tea is my go to morning drink. It's smooth and subtle while providing the early caffeine boost. Tazo's Awake version is sort of a letdown. It doesn't taste as full as some of the other brands. Not much different in taste and affect than a bulk store black tea. I also got Tazo's earl grey which was better. Overall not a bad experience but ill stick with more traditional brands for my black teas.
9767,ID Millennium,0/0,5.0,"Love how silky smooth this lube feels! A bit difficult to handle since it could stain some clothing, but really easy to clean up."
9768,Bvlgari Blv (bulgari) Perfume By Bvlgari For Women.Eau De Parfum Spray,0/0,5.0,I always liked this perfume. Smells really good and has a good fixation for all day long. And the price is really good if compared with another stores.
9769,"Lee's 40/55 Original Undergravel Filter, 12-Inch by 48-Inch",0/0,5.0,Some things just work as intended. With good tank maintence this provides excelent biological filtration. A good air pump and a 2 to 3 inch bed of gravel complete the picture.
9770,Primula Gift Set of 12 Assorted Green Tea With Fresh Jasmine Flowers,0/0,5.0,"THIS TEA IS A HIT EVERYTIME, THE BLOOMING FLOWER IS A SITE TO BEHOLD, ALWAYS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION, ONE BALL MAKES UP TO 3 POTS OF TEA AND IT HAS GREAT FLAFOUR."
9771,Kringelring Clutching toy,0/0,5.0,I am in love with this teether/toy combo. Baby can chew on it AND play with it. The colored pegs are actually somewhat stretchy and have some give to them.
9772,"Desenex Antifungal Powder, Cures Athletes Foot - 3 OZ, 3 Pack",0/0,5.0,I have had athlete's feet and fungal toenails for over 20 years. I started using Desenex two years ago and my athlete's feet was cured and it arrested the developement (but not cured) my fungal toenails.
9773,Concorde Bright Chrome Pen Reader,0/0,5.0,This pen with storage for reading glasses is very nice. The size is reasonable and glasses are good quality. Pen refills install easily.
9774,Multipet Nuts for Knots Ball Medium Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"Yes he likes this one too. He uses it as a ball and also as a toy to chew on. The threads are woven tightly together so it does not fall apart quickly. He has had it for at least a month, chews on it every day, and only about 1/10 has been removed by him. Nice product."
9775,Clubman After Shave Lotion 6 oz.,0/0,4.0,"I have been buying this for years, it does like the commercials used to say, tightens pores and chin chillers, tone your skin and make it smooth and comfortable after shaving, smells good too, good product."
9776,Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,0/0,5.0,"I discovered this type of thermometer at my pediatrician and look for the same as his but it was $400, then I found this exergen same thing, same brand but way cheaper as it is for public not professionals. I like it a lot, easy to use especially on a crying fussy baby and acurate reading. I recomend it to anyone. I even purchase one and sent it to France for my little niece as we cannot find this product over there!"
9777,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder,0/0,4.0,"So I have been using Syntha-6 Chocolate Mint protein powder for the last month or two now. That is obviously a little soon to notice crazy results, but I do feel like the added post-workout protein has helped me. I generally mix this product with Skim Milk after a workout and mix using a Blender Bottle. It tastes great and works even as just a meal substitute when you are in a rush. I'm sure there are more natural and healthy protein supplements now available, but for the price, it's a solid choice."
9778,"Plantin Black Truffle Infused Olive Oil, 3.5-Ounce Bottle",0/0,5.0,"Pop up some corn in a fry pan like we did as kids. Add popcorn salt (not regular salt) and drizzle with this oil and OMG, what a flavor boost! Saw this on Ina Garten's Foodnetwork show and we are hooked. Great savory popcorn for any dinner party or bowl game! You do have to like truffle's, or don't bother. I pop with peanut oil, so be aware of food allergies. This truffle oil is great in salad's with Champagne vinegar. Yummmmmm!"
9779,Pureology Purevolume Blowdry Amplifier,0/0,5.0,"Love this product and is worth the price. boosts my blond hair with blowdrying and keeps it's volume for the rest of the day. You barely need to use any, so this bottle lasts and extraordinarily long time."
9780,Tweezerman Folding Ilashcomb #1054 (834),0/0,5.0,This is a simple little item that I can't live without. I have used these for years and this is my second one of this particular brand. the last one lasted about 5 years with is awesome considering I use it everyday.

9782,"Earthbath All Natural Shampoo, 16-Ounce",0/0,5.0,I purchased this fragrance-free shampoo along with one of Earthbath's scented sprays. The combination keeps my dog smelling fresh in-between groomings.
9783,"Bergan Twinkle Replacement Ball, Colors Vary",0/0,4.0,The ball I received was green with red LEDs. So it blended in a little too much with my track - The Bergan Turbo Track - which made it difficult for my little spaz to notice it was even there unless it lit up (note
9784,"Hawaiian Tropic Dark Tanning Oil, Original 8 fl oz (237 ml)",0/0,4.0,"Very nice dark tan, easy to apply, great tanning oil. Sometimes a little bit too oily though, as the liquid comes out very abruptly."

9787,"Finish Powerball Tablets, Fresh Scent",0/0,5.0,"For the longest time, we used Cascade in various forms but we were never really happy. I thought it was our old dishwasher but when a friend moved he gave us an open box of Finish gel packs. They worked much better and I thought I try the various Finish products. I really like the Quantum packs, but they are about double as expensive and not much better. I would give these ones a 4.5 out of 5 and the Quantum a 5 out of 5. However, I'm rounding up because they are much cheaper."
9788,Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magnetic Calendar,0/0,3.0,It was not what i expected when I ordered it. I was looking for soemthign to help teach my son the days of the week and his numbers and things liek that. this is just a normal calander.

Stick to UNSCENTED NO PRESERVATIVE CREAMS AND OILS TO BE SAFEI HAD A REACTION TO BIOTONEWhat are the reactions to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate allergy?Typical allergic contact dermatitis may occur. It may take several days after exposure to the allergen for symptoms to appear. Typical symptoms include redness, swelling, itching, and fluid-filled blisters. Patients commonly present with a scattered generalized dermatitis or dermatitis affecting hands and arms.Another concern of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is that it may have adverse effects on the immune system. It is also suspected to be an environmental toxin. Further research into these areas is necessary."

9802,Foojoy Shoumei White Tea 100 Tea Bags,0/0,3.0,"Foojoy make good tea products, I became a tea drinker when I found out the health benefits tea can give you. White tea is somewhat rare to find, this tea in particular shoumei white tea is good but not the best, the price I found it in an Asian store near my house was 1.36$ US dollars, cheap right? You can find better white teas on other sites."
9803,Solvit Waterproof Bucket Seat Cover for Pets,0/0,5.0,It's super easy to slip on and off for quick removal for the human sitters. My wife is a dog walker who uses it all the time. Fits on her 06 Rav4.

9806,Anti-Nausea Ginger Gum 24 Count,0/0,4.0,"I currently take methotrexate, & often have terrible chemo nausea from it. I have found that ginger is one of the only things that immediately starts to help the nausea. But I don't always have fresh ginger on hand, so I bought this gum a month ago to keep by the bed. For me, it's not nearly as effective as chewing on a fresh piece of raw ginger, but it's far better than not using it at all. I still have to take Zofran for the nausea, but this gum helps make it more bearable while waiting for the Zofran to kick in."
9807,Nutramax Cosequin for Cats - 80 Sprinkle Capsules,0/0,5.0,"This was the exact product I was searching for so I was very happy and satisfied. I have ordered products from other vendors only to discover it was basically falsely advertised to LOOK like the name brand I wanted but WAS NOT THAT PRODUCT , and therefore I refused to use it for fear of doing harm to my pets! Nutramax Cosequin is an EXCELLENT supplement with wonderful results. I have used with 2 of my geriatric kitties and have seen marked improvement in mobility from arthritis or just cranky bones for aging kitties. My vet is a big advocate of this product as well, but I was able to purchase at a much better price through Amazon. My advice is to ALWAYS do your homework and triple check ALL INGREDIENTS to be sure whatever product you are searching for is NOT A KNOCK OFF!! Thank you very much!"
9808,ZOOB Traveler 40-Piece Set,0/0,5.0,Bought this as a gift for my friend's son and they love it (her 4 year old daughter is playing with it also).My son has the 250 pcs and also like it.

9811,Remington WDF4820 Smooth and Silky Hypoallergenic Foil Women's Shaver,0/0,1.0,"My teenage daughter dropped & broke the shaver I'd had for 13 years. I thought Remington would be good -- a company known for making razors. Wrong! We've had it for about 3 months. My daughter said it didn't work as well as the old one, but I'd read it takes awhile to get used to. She's used it plenty & asked to use a regular razor, something she's been very afraid to (and still is). I tried it & I see why! It DOES NOT CUT HAIR!! One review said it was because of the trimmer before the foils, but my old one had that & worked wonderfully. I thought ""they just don't make things like hey used to,"" but took a chance yesterday & bought a $10 Conair LWD1. What a difference! It works! Remington really messed up with this one, so I'll never buy that brand again! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
9812,PCA SKIN - pHaze 4 Gentle Exfoliant (7 oz),0/0,5.0,I love this exfoliant. It's very gentle. I use twice a week and it doesn't dry out my skin. Just love it!
9813,Lazy Kettle All-Natural Liquid Smoke,0/0,4.0,"I purchased this to use in my homemade fresh (unsmoked)sausages and hot dogs because I did not want to trouble with the chemicals (sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite) required for cold smoking meat products.AromaIt's intoxicating...a well-rounded smoky nose with no acrid or sharp smell. To me, it's the kind of aroma that I could sniff continuously without getting tired of it or bothered by it. It smells like your favorite smoked dish in a bottle. When mixed into sausage mixtures at about 3 tablespoons to a 5-pound batch, I can detect a faint, pleasant smoky aroma before and after cooking.TasteAs expected straight out of the bottle, it has a fairly oily texture with a bland--perhaps slightly bitter--taste. No sugar or other additives in this liquid smoke.I will admit that I'm still trying to calibrate my palate to the taste of a liquid smoke that is mixed throughout the sausage rather than concentrated in the outer ""smoke ring"" one gets after smoking naturally. My recipes typically call for 3 tablespoons of liquid smoke in a 5-pound batch of sausage. I don't really taste any smokiness in the product. I'll continue to adjust concentration until I reach my desired level of smoky taste.Bottom line"
9814,GIVENCHY POUR HOMME BLUE LABEL For Men By GIVENCHY Eau de Toilette Spray,0/0,5.0,"Makes chicks cream their pants as the walk past Givenchy = an orgasm in a bottle. It's scent sends females into a cycle of uninterpretable need for the contents of your ""package"""
9815,Zippo Street Chrome Pocket Lighter,0/0,2.0,I really liked this lighter because it didn't go out when it was windy but I only used it a couple times and now it won't spark at all it's probably the flint but it seems like too much of a hassle to use this lighter ill stick with the cheap plastic ones
9816,Optimum Nutrition Creatine Powder,0/0,5.0,"I use 1/2 spoon per workout. I love it. I cal really feel the difference between taking it or not. & I take it every workout. It is tasteless, has no grit, dissolves well & mixes well with juice. RECOMMENDED. I &#60;3 Optimum Nutrition."
9817,"Tantus Fantasy Gag, Black",0/0,5.0,"The gag for me was just about perfect size, maybe wish was a hair longer. This will definitely fill your mouth and keep the person quiet. Has no taste but does collect hair but easy to clean. If you want a good penis gag this is it!!"

9820,"Olbas Inhaler, 0.01 Ounce",0/0,5.0,"I have been using the Olbas Inhalers for years now. I find them good for opening stuffy nasal passages with out drying them out. It's portable and good to take on a plane. They last about 3 to 6 months based on frequency of use. I keep them all over the house for a mental pick me up as well. The peppermint oil has a cooling, lifting feeling too on stuffy days. I find this a more personal way to use aromatheropy. I will continue to use these for some time to come. I"

9823,Wildroot Wildroot Hair Dressing,0/0,5.0,"I've been using this stuff for over a year, now, and like how it holds your hair without being stiff or greasy. The smell reminds me of the old barbershops."
9824,"KONG Squeaker Tennis Balls Dog Toy, 3-Pack",0/0,5.0,"My Boxer/Mastiff absolutely loves these! I've tried buying him other tennis balls but he shows no interest in them. Had a couple squeakers die but squeakers die in everything. Think about it, its being chewed on by a dog, eventually its gonna wear down. Obviously some dogs are more aggressive chewers and mine isn't, he just loves running around the yard squeaking them. I usually save the broken squeaker balls for when we go out late at night so i dont bother the neighbors. Great product though"
9825,"EcoNugenics Ten Mushroom Formula, 120 Vegetable-capsules bottle",0/0,3.0,"I have used this product in the past but I prefer the Host Defense brand. I switch them up sometimes to get different variations of mushrooms, but this isn't my brand of choice."
9826,Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer,0/0,1.0,"in my iphone, ipad, ipod and android , its called similac baby , and it has it all and it works for me and i dont have to keep up with a different device and is the best app for this and its free . hope this helps"

9828,PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer,0/0,3.0,"Functionally, it's great. It has just about everything you'd want for charging AA or AAA batteries.The display is miserable, and why I'm knocking two stars. What you see changes depending on viewing angle, and requires some interpretation and guessing as to what is actually going on.That said, I still use mine, and have no intention of switching any time soon."
9829,"Ricochet Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint, 100-Count Mints (Pack of 6)",0/0,2.0,The package makes it seem like these are typical peppermint hard candies (with Xylitol). They're not. They actually look like aspirin tablets and dissolve in about three seconds. They're not what I thought I was buying.The flavor's ok --just ok. It's hard to say for sure when it's gone before you know it.
9830,"RiceSelect Organic Texmati Brown Rice, 32-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,"We use this in our rice cooker all the time and it is a good balance of filling and nuttiness. I have not tried it stovetop in a long time, but I remember it cooking fine that way, too. We have had a subscribe and save on this for over a year, so I'm not just saying this idly."
9831,"Benecol Smart Chews, Caramel, 120-Count Soft Chews",0/0,3.0,"After using this product for many months, I finally had my blood work done. Unfortunately, there was no lowering of my cholesterol, actually, it went up by one. Mind you, I am a healthy eater and exercise regularly. I was a bit disappointed. So whether or not it really helps, I am not too sure. I was just trying to prevent having to take medications. After I am done with my supply of benecol, I am going to see what happens without taking it too."
9832,MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver,0/0,4.0,Bought one for each of the three men in our family. Not only works for the guys but makes the ladies happy too (no more cries of &#34;help&#34; from the shower).
9833,SweatVac Headband,0/0,3.0,"I have been having a difficult time finding a good headband for when I workout, most of them are too thin or won't stay in place. This one I wore once and it was already too loose to stay put. Might be ok to wear outside of working out but it just wasn't for me, especially not for the price."
9834,Goldwell Kerasilk Ultra Rich Shampoo (select option/size),0/0,5.0,I have used Kerasilf for years. It is pricey but your hair is so healthy when you use Kerasilk products.
9835,Spectrum 33300 Mop And Broom Organizer,0/0,4.0,"This little contraption does what I need it to do and was a good purchase for the money. Easy to install and, so far, so good."
9836,Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count,0/0,5.0,"The floss head works better than the stock all bristle head for the oral-B electric toothbrush (in my experience). Feels pleasant as it sweeps your gums. There is less bristle, so it doesn't take as much toothpaste and it doesn't last as long as the stock head (i probably push too hard though).I've read a lot of reviews saying people received fake product. I bought mine &#34;ships from Amazon.com&#34; and it's definitely genuine, made in Germany. Just a thought."
9837,Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips,0/0,5.0,"I know this product is a little gross to write about but anyway, I love Biore Pore Strips. Wet your nose with warm water and let this little paper mache get crispy then pull it off! You can hold it up to the light and see all the clogged pores you have freed. I have used these for years about once every two weeks to keep my nasal area looking clean and neat."
9838,MASTEY Paris Traite Cream Shampoo 32oz/960ml,0/0,5.0,"For years as a young woman I switched shampoos every few months, never knowing why. In 1983 the stylist who cut my hair used Trait&eacute;, and I haven't used another brand since. Recently the beauty supply where I've been buying it closed, so I'm relieved to find it online. I'm growing gray with Trait&eacute;, and happily."
9839,"Bergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary",0/0,5.0,"I have several of these and my cats love them, but the balls seem to disappear. Any idea how I can buy just the balls."
9840,Zhena's Gypsy Tea Raspberry Earl Organic Tea,0/0,5.0,I love the flavor of this tea plus it sooths the Lichen Planus I have in my mouth. I would highly recommend it.

9842,Kid Galaxy Morphibians Shark,0/0,4.0,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter liked my 5 y/o's remote controlled pony airplane. For Christmas I decided to get her a remote controlled car. I was looking for something that was durable and would be easy for her to use. She LOVES this car! It took her about a week to figure out the controls, but now she is a pro at using it. Both girls like to be chased by the car in the house. We have hard wook floors and carpet and the car works great on both. I can't wait to see how it works outside in the summer.The one thing I recommend doing is buying rechargable batteries for it. It doesn't suck a lot of battery life, but it seems the rechargable ones last longer."
9843,Vanicream Vanicream Sunscreen Sport Spf 35,0/0,5.0,"I am fair skinned, but live in Florida. Over the years, I have gone through many different brands of sunscreen. I found out about Vanicream after reading the EWG reviews, and after trying many different highly rated sunscreens on that list. By far, I find this to be the best sunscreen I have ever used. Some of the others smell bad or don't last. I put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day, even after swimming. Because it is really thick, it is a hassle to put on, but it does last. If I have been swimming a lot, or have been out all day, I usually will touch up later in the day with Kinesys spray sunsceen (in the white or orange bottles), which I also like. As an aside, after using this for about a year, I went to my dermatologist, who just happened to be giving out samples of Vanicream as well."
9844,PetSafe Electronic Pet Feeder,0/0,4.0,"It is a bit noisy and took the cats a bit to get used to - one of them used to run away when he heard it - but now when they hear the sound of the feeder rotating they run towards it. :) Overall this works well but the programming does take quite a few steps. There are five spots, but only four holes that are covered so you can only plan four meals in advance.Each spot holds about a cup of dry food and it is really easy to clean."
9845,Puzzled Chinese Dragon Boat Woodcraft Construction Kit,0/0,5.0,"Purchased this for our grandson for Christmas. He really enjoyed putting it together. I've purchased others also, which he enjoyed."
9846,Creativity for Kids Awesome Origami,0/0,5.0,I ordered this for my 2 granddaughters and they love it (ages 8 and 10). It is an excellent starter kit for young children wanting to learn origami. The ordering process was easy and the delivery was on time or even a little earlier than estimated date. I was completely satisfied.
9847,"Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Sweetheart Candy Bouquet, 1 Dozen Red Chocolate Roses",0/0,5.0,"I needed some flowers/chocolates shipped to Afgahnistan to give my wife for Valentine's Day. Real flowers never would have survived the trip. I ordered these, and they looked good. She was very happy with them. The artificial flowers are high quality, and the chocolate didn't melt or get crushed. The packaging was good for this type of product."
9848,Glucosamine for Dogs - Hip & Joint Formula Level 1 - 150 Chewable Tablets,0/0,4.0,"As far as I can tell, it seems to be helping my dog's arthritis. She must like the flavor well enough since she eats them just fine, and she can be picky sometimes. Wish the tablets had MSM in them."
9849,PetSafe Staywell Pet Door with Clear Hard Flap,0/0,5.0,I absolutely love this pet door. I have purchased several over the years and have never been disappointed with this brand. Easy to follow instructions and designed to hold up well under constant use. Also keeps the weather out.
9850,"Cascade 1000 Canister Filter for up to 100 Gallon Aquariums, 265gph",0/0,5.0,great filter definately recommend it my aquarium is finally clear. it came with its own media but you do need extra for it to work effectivly. very easy to assemble.
9851,Breyer Sumatra,0/0,4.0,"The Breyer horses are beautiful. She loves the sparkle on the wings. They tend to tip over, but we just put them on a shelf that doesn't get bumped."
9852,"Yogi Woman's Nursing Support, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,4.0,Just one cup and my milk production doubled. I think I bought too much. Haha Don't drink right before bed! You will wake up needing to pump like crazy.
9853,Wahl 4120-200 All-Body Massage Powerful Therapeutic Massager in Pharmacy Box,0/0,2.0,"Great product but I was sent, apparently, a refirb. massager. The box came with only 4 attachments instead of the massager with the six in the description I paid for. When I contacted the sellers, they offered a refund or a replacement. I simply wanted the two attachments they owed me or the difference from the box with the 6 attachments in it. They gave me an excuse that it was the company's warehouse that was at fault, not them and I never got a response back from them when I asked what we can do about them over charging me for the product. It is a great massager, just be careful who you buy it from."
9854,"Twistix Dental Chews for Pets with Vanilla/Mint Flavor, Small",0/0,4.0,My small dogies like this product and it gets digested well. I would like to see more flavors in the future

9856,"Terra Nova Signature Scent, China Musk Perfume Essence",0/0,5.0,"I have smelled this perfume on a friend and wanted to order some. I finally found it on Amazon and ordered it. There was no information in the packaging that the longer the bottle set the more fragrent it became. I was ready to send it back, but after a week I retried it and the smell was much better. I love the light smell and would buy this as a gift for my friends."
9857,Everholder FURemover Broom,0/0,5.0,I got this to use to get pet and human hair up from the carpet before vacuuming and hopefully maybe not have to vacuum as often. It has worked as I had hoped and I don't have to clean my vacuum cleaner brushes near as often.
9858,Melissa & Doug See & Spell,0/0,5.0,Bought this for my nephew and he LOVED it. I will be purchasing another one for my son. Very cool item.
9859,"Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea, Decaf India Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)",0/0,5.0,This tea tastes great. Coffee shop flavor for an economical home price. I love that it comes in decaf! I have looked all over and not been able to find the decaf in stores.
9860,Wahl Pet Stylique Designer/Trimmer,0/0,5.0,"This is not for my pets (I have two dogs) but for me. My last one just dropped dead after about ten years of weekly use. It is the best nose, ear and moustache trimmer I have ever had. There is nothing marketed for humans that does such a multi purpose job as does this."
9861,Beetle Juice (1988),0/0,5.0,Special eddition of a favorite movie for under 10$ And when you order this it comes with a digital copy so you can watch instantly.
9862,Jolly Pet 4-1/2-Inch Vanilla Scented Jolly Critter Squirrel,0/0,4.0,"My lab mix loves this toy! after 6 months , she finally killed the squeeker today. I think the key is that it is big enough so that she can't really get too much in her mouth. I have never seen a squeeking toy last more than 6 minutes with her, let alone 6 months! She likes to carry it around and throw it up and try to catch it. The only down side is that it doesn't keep her attention for too awfully long. Overall, the best squeek toy we've found."

9864,Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments,0/0,4.0,"The attachments have an odd angle compared to my replaced clippers. I have trouble raising my arms, so it would be fine for a person who can use their arms normally. It is much quieter than my old clippers."
9865,Petmate Pet Taxi Fashion Kennel,0/0,5.0,A little starving kitten showed up at my house and after nobody claimed her for several weeks - I'm keeping her. I meant to use this as a means for transportation to the vet & as a way to introduce her to my adult cats to keep her safe. She has adopted it as her bed so apparently it's pretty comfortable. I like it.
9866,"Innotek Anti-Bark Spray Collar, Citronella",0/0,5.0,"As with another review I read, it took 3 barks for my noisiest dog to connect barking with being sprayed. Now when I put it on her, she rarely even tries to bark and she's figured out that if a dog standing next to her barks, SHE gets sprayed (so she moves away). Contrary to what others have experienced, I've had it for over a year and have only changed the battery twice and just now started the 3rd can of spray. If she suddenly starts barking, I know it's time to add citronella or replace the battery. I have 3 dogs ~ luckily only one is a barker (I swear she barks at clouds moving), one rarely barks and one has never barked(!). Shock collars seemed too cruel so this was perfect. Somehow I've misplaced the collar and recently paid full price for a new smaller version for small dogs. Results not nearly so good with that one so I'm going to buy this version online again."

9873,Olivia Garden Healthy Hair Ionic Massage Hair Brush,0/0,5.0,What can I say? It's a nice hairbrush. The hand is a nice size and shape and the natural bristle to plastic bristle ratio is perfect.
9874,CytoSport Muscle Milk Light,0/0,4.0,"Great way to get your protein in.What I like best is the price for the flavor since there are cheaper prices but usually only for vanilla and chocolate. If you want to try out a new flavor, banana is a pretty safe bet. Tried the white chocolate one and it wasn't anything special."
9875,Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,0/0,5.0,"My son loves this teether. He loves moving things and this is great for that since it twists and turns. My husband and I actually play with it too sometimes! Great teether and also great toy, it keeps my son entertained for a long time. (He is 6 months old)"

Though be warned - a pill pushing mainsteam MD will not know what you are talking about. Try a naturopath or an MD with a broader vision of healthcare.
9882,KONG Material Dog - Dr. Noys' Dog Toy,0/0,5.0,"My dog loves his little beaver! I was a bit worried when it came because it is small, but it fits his Italian Greyhound mouth perfectly and he squeaks it all the time. The extra squeaker is a great touch so the life of the toy is extended. This is also the first toy he hasn't made bald by pulling out all the fur."
9883,Rehab Accessory Pack II,0/0,4.0,Great extensions for the price. Never used the sponge but really like the sock puller after hip replacement. The shoe horn and grabber will probably be in use forever.
9884,Styli-Style Liquid Liner 24,0/0,1.0,"This eye liner was cheap, so I shouldn't have been surprised at its performance. I used it once, and it was fine. After that, however, it dried up. Problem lies in the construction, I think. The pen has to be stored--point down-- to access the liquid, otherwise it pools at the other end. Or maybe I just got an old one. Anyway, I'm going to stick with the liquid liners that have an ""inkwell"" into which you stick the tip."

9897,Zanies Laser Beam Mouse Cat Toy,1/1,5.0,"I love to watch my little calico chase this. She loves anything that shines or reflects (my keys, jewelry&#8230;), so I knew she&#8217;d like this. When she seems to be bored with the floor, I move it to the wall and it&#8217;s like she&#8217;s playing a whole new game &#8211; so cute."
9898,Mini Apollo Astronaut,0/0,5.0,"This astronaut is about 2 1/2 inches tall. This Apollo Astronaut is very detailed.

9900,Sunbeam 732-500 King Size Heating Pad with UltraHeatTechnology,1/1,4.0,"I haven't purchased a heating pad in ages, so it was neat to see that they've kept up with the times. The dial is simple and has 3 levels of heat, and the power cable itself is a good length. This thing can get pretty hot too. I'm surprised how hot the high level can get. It's a good size, as it can cover most of my back when i'm using it. I don't have to keep moving it to different spots.The only drawback is that the blue cloth constantly falls off of it. Its a cheap button that holds it on there. Staying snapped shut is the last thing this button wants to do. So the sleeve keeps falling off and ending up in the couch or whatever. But that itself isn't a big deal, i think its only necessary so the plastic doesn't touch your bare skin if you're into nude heat padding. I usually have a shirt or something on, so its not a deal breaker at all.Also, it seems every heating pad is geared towards the elderly, so if you're young and cool and hip like myself, you might feel a little old with the geriatrically oversized power switch. Again, not a dealbreaker."

9903,Framesi Biogenol Reconditioner Conditioner 33.8 oz,0/0,5.0,"I've been using Biogenol since the early '90s, when my hairdresser first used it on my color-treated hair. I've used many conditioners since then, just to stay current, but I always return to Biogenol. I have long hair, and it makes it look beautiful. If you have short hair, use the conditioner very sparingly."
9904,Sentry HC Groom'n Comb/with Catnip Pouch,0/0,1.0,"I was so excited about getting this for our 5 cats. I thought for sure it would be a huge hit, seeing that you can add catnip to it and our kitties love the 'nip. But it only took a matter of minutes before it popped off the wall and was on the floor. Losing interest immediately. The sticky pads are not sticky at all. I currently have it hot-glued to the floor register and if that doesn't hole much longer I'm switching to super glue then gorilla glue then maybe plaster. This is such a great idea for cats, but horrible assembled.I would not buy this again, not for the hassle it is to get it to stay in place."
9905,Fruit of the Earth Vitamin-E Cream 4 oz. + 4 oz. Jar,0/0,5.0,"I love this cream! They no longer sell Vitamin E cream at my local pharmacies and I decided to try this new brand after seeing the positive reviews. It's the best Vit E cream I've used. Rich, light & pleasant fragrance, great for my dry skin and for my 2 yr old as well. Made in the USA, not tested on animals, great price and great product! I have already reordered more."
9906,"Bob's Best Coral Calcium, 2000 mg, 90 caplets",0/0,1.0,"February 13 studies recommended a smaller dose of calcium and linked excess calcium with heart disease.

9911,Weekend By Burberrys Womens Eau De Parfum (EDP) Spray 3.4 Oz - Perfume,0/0,5.0,"Boyfriend recommended this to me since I was looking for a fresh, lighter perfume that would last all day (or night). I don't like being overwhelmed by scents and two spritzes of this in the morning leave me very happy throughout the day. I definitely recommend it.Only downside is that you can only purchase this through Burberry online or from Amazon now...so stock up while you can :)"
9912,Cottonelle Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes Travel Pack,0/0,2.0,"The product itself is fine, but for whatever reason, it was really difficult to pull one individual wipe out of the packet. It didn't seem like the outside edge of each wipe was centered so as to be able to easily access it through the opening in the middle of the packaging. That opening is fairly small, too, so it was hard to dig around in there to pull out one wipe. I wound up tearing the top wipe trying to separate it from the one underneath it. I wanted to get this to have a travel pack, but one that was more environmentally sound than individually wrapped wipes, but I wouldn't buy this particular product again."
9913,Sea-Monkeys Original Instant Life,0/0,1.0,I followed all the directions to the letter. That didn't stop every single sea monkey from dying within days. Some didn't even hatch. I had better luck with hatching the sea monkeys used for feeding bigger fish. I got thousands out of that.
9914,Dandelion Root Tea 24 Bags,0/0,3.0,"bought from reading 'the plan' book, it's a recommendation for Health, but prefer pills myself. As they say 'to each their own'."
9915,Gib's Bottled Hell Hot Pepper Sauce,0/0,5.0,Best flavor hot sauce on the market. Does NOT taste like tobasco. You can add this to &#34;heat up&#34; a bowl of chili and it tastes like it was cooked in.
9916,North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate,0/0,5.0,"This is the third baby gate we have used in our house. The first two we were displeased with, so we wanted to give this one a shot.Installation was a BREEZE for this one compared with the other two. To be fair, the other two were in more difficult locations (bottom of stairs and a large entryway) but I was pleasently surprised at the ease of setting this thing up.We used the cups but did not screw them into the wall, because we plan on moving it again soon. i have had zero issues with it moving at all even though we didn't screw into the wall.THE GATE ACTUALLY CLOSES ON IT'S OWN! both of our other gates claim to ""automatically latch closed"" after you open them, but they don't. this one does! every time. i also love that it stays open if you want it to.the dual locking mechanism is nice too. we like this gate so much we ordered another for our house. highly recommend this gate to anyone."
9917,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure,1/1,4.0,This oil makes your skin so soft after using it once. I am trying different oils and this one is so far the best. I will definitely order more.
9918,Vittles Vault II 40-Pound Clear Base Cranite Top,0/0,5.0,"I purchased this tub after noticing something was nibbling on our dog's food bag.The construction is quite nice and the top really does fit well.The top really *snaps* on and has a rubber seal; and then there is a section that twists out of the lid, for easy access, which is also rubber-sealed - ""Vault"" is a proper name for this.The only minor issue I would say I have with this is the shape. I'm a tall guy with long arms, but to scoop the very last of the food out of bottom of this thing is pretty cumbersome unless you take the whole top off - not really an issue, just the only ""negative"" thing I could think of.I've owned this for over a year at this point and have had no repeat issues with anything stealing our dog's food!I'm happy to have it!"
9919,"Bob's Red Mill Granola, Crunchy Coconut, 18-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)",0/0,5.0,love that this granola is crispy and has a hint of coconut without being too sweet. We add nuts and craisins and/or raisins to it.

9921,"Traxxas Lg Servo Saver:S,R,H,N,NB,NS TRA1844",0/0,5.0,I bought this servo for my traxxas electric stampede and Nitro stampede. Because i hit a wall with my Electric stampede in a snow storm. These things break way to easy.

9926,Burberry Perfume by Burberry for women Personal Fragrances,0/0,5.0,Great perfume that last all day with out being annoying. Perfect size for travel. I will order larger size soon. Perfume sometimes turns sour on my skin and I was afraid to order larger size....
9927,PONARIS NASAL EMOLLIENT Size,0/0,5.0,This product was recommended by my ENT doctor to resolve a constant build-up of 'crust' in my nose. His diagnosis was that the air-flow was being obstructed at one point and causing a build-up. This product 'smoothed-out' the air flow and now I don't have a problem with the crust. And my wife is very happy because I don't have to pick my nose all the time now. :-)
9928,1/16 31 Ford Van,0/0,5.0,"Recently bought this kit and began construction.The parts are well made but there was a tiny bit of flashing on one part - no problem though.The Engine is extremely detailed ,even has a dipstick.The rest of the kit so far is quite easy to build ,the engine being the most detailed part.All doors open and the chassis can be made to roll freely.The only thing i did not like about it's design was that the kit option on the fender where the spare tire sits ,you get two left front fenders and when you begin to fit it it is a little tricky and seems odd.you can go online and get the full assembly instructions from the minicraft website - there you can see the kit trees and how the kit will assemble , so that will give you a good idea about the product beforehand.Also , after i bought this kit i went online and found several others and some were priced as high as $150.00 ,so being a discontinued kit from the 1990's may make it a bit rare , not sure. I would definitely recommend this kit for a moderately experienced builder , but not for someone just beginning model crafting , as I think the smaller and more delicate pieces would just cause frustration."

9932,OTC ORTHOTEX Knee Stabilizer Wrap with Spiral Stays,0/0,2.0,This item had to be exchanged for larger size. Once i got the larger size it slipped after 20 steps just like it says on the damn review. I am so disappointed now i got to pay to ship both back. What a waste but i guess that is what i get for paying a low price. The pro it looks nice.
9933,Very Irr&#233;sistible Givenchy,0/0,5.0,"I prefer he very irresistible sensual (the purple one) because it lasts longer on you, but the both smell almost the same. you simply can't go wrong with any very irresistible. VERY IMPORTANT"

9936,Mary Kay Satin Lip Set (Mask and Balm),0/0,2.0,"I read rave reviews of this on Makeupalley and thought I would give it a shot. The mask seems to work to help smooth out rough or dry lips. The balm is...well, lame. It feels fairly waxy and just not the best balm by any stretch of the imagination. It does not last all night either if you put it on before bed. C.O. Bigelow 8 hour overnight lip balm is far superior to this. This is definitely NOT amazing or the best or any of the other words used in other reviews to describe it. Maybe if you have ""normal"" lips and not super dry lips, it is great...but if you need it to help with a dry lip problem, this product is just not what it is hyped up to be."
9937,Oster Part,0/0,4.0,I'm happy I came across this part online so I didn't have to send my clipper to get fixed. Just what I needed.

9941,Ricochet Robots,0/0,5.0,"I enjoy this game because it expands a specific kind of lateral thinking, and any number of people can play. One downside is that because it is pure puzzle-solving, the most experienced players will almost always win. However, there is a check against this making it boring for less experienced players"
9942,Bang Gun with Flag,0/0,5.0,"I give this five stars because I got what I paid for and love it. Yes, it's not the most perfect quality but it did the job when I dressed up as Harley Quinn for Halloween. Who ever invented this, THANK YOU!"

I put three in the freezer and keep one in the fridge. Great for udon dishes, soups, black beans, etc. Also works to make vegan french toast! The price is great. Locally it's $8 each package so this saves a few bucks getting it in bulk."
9946,Folkmanis Mini Raccoon 5in Finger Puppet,0/0,5.0,"I read the review of Encinita's Mom and thought...what a great idea! I too purchased the Kissing Hand book for my youngest grandchild starting school next fall. What a lovely way to remind them that someone who loves them can always be close by. And this little raccoon makes it fun and is the perfect size for little ones that age. (Although I know older brothers and sisters will like him as well) Imaginations can run wild as they make up stories for this new, furry friend. All their puppets are extremely well made and realistic. Have fun!"
9947,Lupine Designer Dog Lead,0/0,5.0,"Lupine is a U.S. company, that will replace what you buy if your dog CHEWS it up! No questions asked, no excuses!

9952,Meiji - Yan Yan with Chocolate Dip 2.0 Oz.,0/0,4.0,"I pick up some really strange items at my neaby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. Here's one. It's Yan Yan. It comes in a small (2 ounce) somewhat conical container in which there are some small ""sticks"" made of a pastry that tastes like Chinese fortune cookies. The container is partitioned and one side has the sticks and the other side has a chocolate dip. I take the sticks, dip them in the chocolate and, viola, into the mouth they go. Not bad. I use one container as dessert for two meals. Oh, and by the way, the little sticks have words printed on hem, sorta in fortune cookie style.Gary Peterson"
9953,Maybelline ExpertWear Brow & Eye Liner Eye Liners,0/0,5.0,"This is the best color eyeliner (medium brown) for green eyes. I am a makeup artist & have taken modeling classes. This medium brown eyeliner makes green eyes pop. With green eyes, you must be careful not to choose black or dark brown eyeliners because they are too dark and drown out the color of of the green eyes. So this medium brown color is perfect. It also goes on smoothly and rolls up so no sharpening is needed."

9955,"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",0/0,4.0,"We received two of these as baby shower gifts and my 10 month old LOVES them...he started using them around 6 months. I would highly recommend these to anyone. I gave it four stars because it can be tricky to get all of the food particles out and it can be a little messy. That isn't a major problem though because let's face it, a baby learning to eat is going to be messy no matter what you give them."
9956,The Da Bird Value Pack (Includes 1 Da Bird Original Single 3 Foot Pole Cat Toy & 2 Replacement Feathers),0/0,4.0,"I bought this product because of all the positive reviews on amazon and I have to say it lived up to it! One of the cats just LOVES it. It gets him up flipping around the floor as he chases after the feather bird. I am very happy with the purchase of the single 36&#34; pole because it has held up well to constant play everyday and allows me to store the bird out of reach of pry paws, which is important because as the packaging says &#34;put it away or it will be loved to death&#34;. If I don't put it away he proceeds to carry the feather bird around in his mouth and chew it until he removes all the feathers.A few issues I have with it though:1) The feathers do come out fairly easily. Within the first few days he had already ripped out the feathers so I was glad I bought the super pack with 3. It is however an easy fix. I just hot glue gunned the feathers back in place in the plastic head and so far they have held. I will just keep repairing it this way until the feathers are completely ruined. Make sure however if you do this to put the feathers back in the same positioning they came in (see image in product description). This positioning is what gives the feather bird the great bird like movement and spinning. If you put them back another way it doesn't do this as well.2) The feather clip is attached to the pole by a thin string. This string has two issues. First is that within the first few days it came untied from the feather clip. This isn't a big deal; I just tied it back in place. I do however have to retie it almost every other play session. Second, the string is so thin that the cats can easily eat it. I found this out the hard way the first time it broke. I put the toy down and when I came back the other cat was just chewing on the string and had already chewed through it, so be careful.3) Though I have not specifically noticed the fiberglass splinters people had mentioned I did notice my hand was a little raw feeling after a long period of play flipping the pole around. I fixed it by putting some athletic tape on the end of the pole that I held in my hand. Now I am ready for the hours (and I mean hours) of play the cat desires from this toy everyday!"

I wish there was a little more &#34;plumping action&#34;, but it does give a nice, light tingle. One serious drawback is price. For me, sixteen dollars is quite a lot to spend on one lip gloss."

9964,Roux Lash & Brow Tint,0/0,4.0,"I used to have my lashes tinted at a local salon, but this is so much cheaper! The first time I used Roux Lash & Brow Tint, I attempted the process by myself. Definitely have a friend help you (it will burn if it gets in your eyes!) and definitely use petroleum jelly on the skin around your eyes because this product will definitely stain your eye lids."

9969,L'Oreal Paris Superior Preference Color Care System,0/0,5.0,"This is for color Preference Light Beige Brown (6BB). I was so nervous to try this. I waited until I could not take my GRAY roots anymore. I went gray very young, and have about 60% gray. My natural base color is a mousy brown that blond highlights in the summer. At salons, I have been begging them to get rid of the brassy tones that ALWAYS show up on my base color, only to be told that is the only way to cover the gray and give me the medium brown with blonde highlights look. WELL WELL WELL!! Hot diggity I am so excited I can prove them wrong. This covered my grays, was NOT brassy and blended perfectly with my highlights (I did a root application for 30 minutes and then strategically pulled the color through my darker strands for another 10). I will only be going to the salon for highlights 2x a year from now on!! And for less than $10!! AND bonus, under an hour....not FOUR at the salon!! I am just thrilled!! (and so is my husband!!) If you have the ""Jenifer Anniston"" color hair with highlights...go for it!!"

I insert the capsules with an applicator from some OTC vaginal yeast ointment.I don't use the oral pill so I only gave it 4 stars since I don't need it.

9991,Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments,0/0,2.0,"We had an old set of clippers from Wahl. We thought we needed to upgrade, as my wife gives our teenaged boys haircuts and I cut my own hair. If a &#34;professional&#34; used these &#34;professional&#34; clippers, he or she would soon be looking for a new line of work. Little power, a blade adjustment that didn't work properly...why the heck did I buy these things? Maybe Oster to stick to making blenders? Will be looking for the top grade Wahl model, as the old set lasted for years and countless haircuts. Lesson learned."

9993,"Mighty Leaf Chamomile Citrus Tea, 15 Tea Pouches",0/0,5.0,"In the past I never thought that there could be so much difference between tea and tea. I had noticed Might Leaf teas for a long time but mainly because of their name. I thought that it is a clever name. Typically we don't think of leaves as mighty (maybe the trunk of a plant but not the leaf).Then one day I found myself with an upset stomach in a coffee shop. Coffee was not an option so I was asking for Chamomile Tea. Indeed I was offered Chamomile Citrus from Mighty Leaf and fell in love with it right away, never mind my upset stomach. Since typically chamomile is my least favorite tea I tried the other flavors too. My absolute favorite is Green Tea Tropical. Summing it up"

I went online, searched for theraband and found these here at Amazon. I bought every single resistance bands they had.The colors represent their resistance, I believe yellow being the least, then red, green, blue and I think finally blue being the highest resistance.I like these longer bands since you can cut them where necessary to create whatever length you need.I use these every day to continue to strengthen the area around my neck."
